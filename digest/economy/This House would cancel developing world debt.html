    <h1 class="print-title">This House would cancel developing world debt</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Debt is an issue that affects countries all over the world. Almost all countries are in debt as their governments take loans to cover for variations in their tax receipts. Yet while many developed countries such as Greece and Ireland are increasingly facing debt crises of their own the effect of such debt is not nearly as crippling as it is for developing nations. Many countries have over the past few decades sought debt restructuring from the IMF and other international institutions, as well as outright cancellation of their debts, such as Mexico in 1982 and 94, Russia in 1996, Argentina in 2001 and Hungary in 2010. Countries with colonial and dictatorial backgrounds in particular have sought recourse to debt cancellation to recover from crippling interest payments to investors in developed countries. Debt cancellation for the world&#39;s poorest countries in the wake of the 2005 Gleneagles summit has made such cancellations acceptable. As a result of this, as well as rapid economic growth, debt as a percent of gross national income in Sub-Saharan Africa fell from 66% to 23% in 2009. While compared to rich world debt this sounds very little the interest rates are much higher for the poorest countries and the resulting debt repayments have much more impact upon basic functions of the state. As developed countries increasingly are having to bail out other developed countries the momentum to help the poorest either through debt cancellation or through aid has stalled.</p>

                    <p>People are more irresponsible when they do not face the consequences of their actions. The same is true of states. When a state is not liable for the risks it takes, it has an incentive to increase its risk<sup>1</sup>. This is the case in debt cancellation. When the developing country does not have to pay off its debt, it has no reason to concern itself with spending loans effectively; if things get bad they can simply have their debt forgiven. This problem was made abundantly clear among financial firms during the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the ensuing global financial crisis; firms felt an incentive to grow so large that their governments would feel compelled to bail them out in the event of a crisis<sup>2</sup>. Thus when the crisis came, states felt compelled to bail out these irresponsible firms. Thus the incentive is always to take on greater amounts of debt, because the more a firm or state takes on the less able they are to service it, and thus the more likely they will require cancellation. The moral hazard problem causes the further perverse incentive to allow their people to suffer as a means of expediting acknowledgment by the creditor countries that they cannot possibly pay off their debts. Clearly, cancelling debt will lead only to further taking on of debt and more careless behavior by developing countries.<br />

                    <p>There is no real incentive to take on further debt generated by cancelling current debt. Countries do not want to suffer from increased interest rates, a likely consequence of debt amnesty, much as occurs in the event of sovereign default. This means countries will only seek the option of debt cancellation when they genuinely cannot repay their debts, and when the higher costs of future borrowing are an acceptable trade-off to escape the crushing burden of massive debt. It is likewise disingenuous to suggest that countries would actively allow their people to suffer just to get out of paying debt. Most countries want to improve the lives of their people and to be able to invest in their benefit, but to do so they must be relieved of their extensive debt burden.</p>

                    <p>When one state, or group of states, is awarded a debt cancellation, fear of similar provisions being made for other states may be aroused in investors. This leads to panic and movement of investment funds from developing world economies, which are now considered relatively more risky, to safer investments in the developed world. This phenomenon is analogous to the flight of capital from countries defaulting on debt, although the effect is admittedly less extreme in this case as the cancellation is being overseen by other sovereign states and international institutions<sup>1</sup>. Nevertheless, fear over investments will drive up interest rates in developing countries that have accepted debt cancellations and in those that are suspected of seeking one. This can drive countries that may not have considered themselves in need of a cancellation to seek one in light of reduced foreign investment. Furthermore, creditor nations are given an incentive, when investing in a developing world prone to receiving debt cancellations, to seek remuneration in-kind for loans, rather than cash payments at future dates. Such arrangements are popular already with the Chinese government, which loans funds in exchange for resource extraction rights in developing countries<sup>2</sup>. Thus, because it harms both developing countries that seek debt cancellation and those that do not by raising interest rates on future loans and promoting the risk of resource exploitation, countries should not be given debt amnesties.<br />

                    <p>The debts of many developing countries were forced upon them at the time of, and often as a condition of, independence. Colonial powers thus placed extensive amounts of their own debt on the shoulders of their former territories. For example, the Netherlands forced Indonesia in 1949 to accept as a condition of independence the entirety of the colonial government&#39;s debt, itself the result of mercantilist exploitation by the mother country and the high cost of fighting the Indonesian rebels who struggled for independence for four years. France imposed a similarly high cost on Haiti in exchange for independence<sup>1</sup>. Forcing a new nation to effectively pay for the exploitation they suffered as well as for the soldiers and weapons that killed their own countrymen is manifestly unjust. Left with little wherewithal to pay, it is only right to cancel the debts owed by these countries.<br />

                    <p>In most cases there was no force in the assumption of debt by former colonies, and only a small part, if any, of the debt of most developing countries is the result of conditions meted out by colonialist states. In any case, it is necessary to consider the costs incurred by the colonizer, namely that they in many cases provided extensive security benefits to the colonies, brought education and Western-style infrastructure and institutions. It seems unreasonable to suggest they be barred from seeking a form of remuneration for these benefits provided. Furthermore, because of the fact that such a small part of the developing world&#39;s debt is a hangover from the colonial era, cancelling all of the debt makes no sense, and cancelling only the small part represented by that legacy would do little to relieve their overall debt burden. Cancelling developing world debt on this basis is thus unfounded.</p>

                    <p>Debt cancellation is a very drastic measure to take in dealing with developing world debt, one that has serious negative consequences such as higher interest rates, and one that often does not address the underlying causes of states&#39; problems, such as corruption. A better measure to address overwhelming debt payments is offered by forbearance agreements, in which payments in arrears are partially or wholly forgiven so long as payments resume and no reduction in the principal owed occurs. This system can help struggling countries recover without creating problems of the same magnitude as a full-fledged debt cancellation. When forbearance is not enough, international institutions offer extensive debt restructuring schemes, which effectively replace an old debt with a new debt with terms that are more manageable for the debtor country. The IMF often implements such schemes<sup>1</sup>. For example, by 2002 Argentina was in such dire financial straits that its ability to repay its debts had become entirely unfeasible. With the help of the IMF, Argentina&#39;s situation has been able to stabilize, thanks largely due to a debt restructuring that made the costs to Argentina less onerous<sup>2</sup>. Such measures are far more desirable and far less disruptive than cancellation.<br />

                    <p>Forbearance can only go so far in helping developing countries. Because the debt still exists, forbearance is merely a means of allowing countries to tread water a while longer. It does not offer a permanent solution for countries incapable of paying off crippling loans; only a debt cancellation can do that. In the case of debt restructuring, often when this is done in the developing world it leads to greater divisions between rich and poor, places onerous restrictions on governments, and can force crippling tax regimes that do not solve the underlying problem, but rather exacerbate them. Only a debt cancellation can fix the problem.</p>

                    <p>Cancelling debt and the interest payments these debts entail is the easiest way of helping the poorest countries develop. The cancellation of the debts would only apply to government to government debt and debts to the big international institutions such as the World Bank so there are relatively few actors who need to agree to the cancellation. As the cancellation would be done between governments it would be easy to target which countries get debt cancellation, this would mean the poorest and most in need but could potentially mean excluding countries where the windfall will simply mean propping up a regime that is brutalizing its own people. The IMF and World Bank could look at countries on a case by case basis to see which countries are most deserving and where the cancellation would have greatest benefits. The actual cancellation of the debts would then be relatively simple, the governments would simply accept that they are never going to be repaid and take the debt off their books.</p>

                    <p>Cancelling debt it not the best way of helping the poorest, it simply results in giving mismanaged countries more money to waste. The poorest countries in the world are often the poorest either because of very high levels of economic mismanagement or through conflict. In neither case should we be helping those in charge of paying off the debt get off the hook. The money saved will not trickle down to the poorest that really need it. Instead extra money should be used as aid which can then be much better targeted.</p>

                    <p>A country can only be accepted as a mature and active member of the society of nations if it can behave like one. When developing countries go hat in hand to the developed world, and often their former colonial masters, they reaffirm a tiered international system and their subordinate place within it. When states fail to pay off their debt, they lose a great deal of international prestige. Spain, for example, in the 16th century, was a major world power. After it defaulted on its debt in 1520, it never succeeded in regaining that status as a major player, always being consigned to the role of minor power that could not even be trusted to handle its internal finances responsibly<sup>1</sup>. By paying off their debts, however painful such payments may be in the present, not having to kowtow to creditors ensures their independence and engenders respect, rather than pity in a country&#39;s neighbours; default breeds contempt. Furthermore, developing countries must resolve their internal corruption and organizational problems that prevent them from effective development<sup>2</sup>. It is likely that corrupt governments would simply use a debt amnesty to run up further debts and solidify their corrupt regimes.<br />

                    <p>Prestige and respect are irrelevant when one&#39;s people are starving. A country cannot ever become a player on the world stage if they cannot even feed their people. To expect countries to pay off extensive debts is entirely unreasonable in light of the huge costs to their people. Countries need a fair start, which debt cancellation can give them, allowing them to no longer focus entirely on debt repayment but instead on things like infrastructure and education so their economies can develop fully.</p>

                    <p>Because of the often insurmountable debt burdens laid on them, developing countries are forced to spend much of their economic resources on servicing the interest on their debt, rarely making much progress on reducing the principal, and thus locking themselves into a perpetual cycle of poverty<sup>1</sup>. For example, due to their debt burdens most African states pay four times as much on interest payments as they do on healthcare. Structural Readjustment Programs instituted by the IMF in some countries in order to reschedule debt payments have actually led to backsliding in quality of education, health, and welfare. Furthermore, developing countries often devote resources to production of &quot;cash crops&quot; for sale in the developed world rather than on food crops. The perverse incentives created by the need to pay off crushing debts has led many people in agriculturally fertile countries to starve. By cancelling debt, these countries have a chance to invest in their own future and devote resources to long-term development, rather than persistent debt repayment.<br />

                    <p>Debt burden is far from the most serious cause of poverty and death in the developing world. Mismanagement by government, corruption, and war are rife in many countries without relation to debt burden. Irrespective of this, however, there is no moral ground for canceling debt just because it makes life better in these countries. It is the fault of the indebted state that it took loans it would find difficult to repay; it is a problem they have brought on themselves and does not absolve them from the responsibility of repayment. Also, the moral hazard created by canceling debt may teach developing countries the wrong lesson, encouraging them to take on further debts<sup>1</sup>.<br />

                    <p>Debts that are incurred by regimes for purposes other than the benefit of the country are called &quot;odious debts&quot;. Such debts are held by many legal theorists, like Alexander Sack and Patricia Adams, to be ethically unenforceable. Expecting a government to pay back the debts accrued by a tyrant or dictator to finance their own self-enrichment is an unjust practice, as the people of the state, and the present regime, have not benefited fully, or at all, from the debts incurred in their name. Rather, as such tyrannical regimes made little distinction between the personal holdings of the dictator and those of the state, the debts accrued by him should be considered personal, not public debt. An example of the debt burden created by dictators is the case of Haiti, where Jean-Claude Duvalier, dictator from 1971 to 1986, pursued a policy of mass corruption and self-enrichment, taking on foreign loans to finance his own lavish lifestyle and the repression of the Haitian people. 40% of Haiti&#39;s current debt is the result of Duvalier&#39;s corruption<sup>1</sup>. To expect the democratic government of Haiti to pay for these excesses is entirely unjust and only compounds to the harms already inflicted by the dictatorship. Clearly, states that lend money to such tyrants cannot justly attempt to extract payment from successor regimes, considering that the loans they made often helped keep repressive dictators in power.<br />

                    <p>Countries cannot be held accountable for doing business with dictators, especially when they are the only legitimate ruler of a territory. Investor states cannot be expected to hold back on their own essential investments abroad because of the nature of the government they have to deal with. There are many different kinds of government structures in the world; trying to assert that only one kind may have legitimate claims for repayment of debt made against them undermines the fabric of international relations and the acceptance of the world&#39;s multicultural and multi-institutional nature. Furthermore, acknowledging regime change as a legitimate ground for debt cancellation encourages instability in developing countries and promoting the risk of coups and revolutions. Groups will seek regime change in order to escape their debt burdens, leading to massive unrest and volatility. For these reasons, states, irrespective of government type or regime change, must be held liable for their debts.</p>
