    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes dictatorship is the best path to development</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Development is the sustained increase in standards of living of a country. There however is no individual indicator that shows that a country is considered developed. The proxy that is usually used is Gross Domestic product per capita which is the total amount a nation produces divided by the country&rsquo;s population. This then captures the relative performance of nations and usually shows how developed a nation is.<a href="/print/67245#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> What it does not show however is how equally that wealth from that output is divided so it is possible that a nation that is very rich by GDP is actually not very developed if all of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of one or two people, an example of this is Equatorial Guinea which is considered a high income economy by the world bank yet also has 76.8% of the population in poverty.<a href="/print/67245#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Dissatisfaction with this has led to the development of the Human Development Index for the Development Reports of the United Nations Development Programme. These include a broader range of indicators using Gross National Income per capita (only slightly different from GDP) with purchasing power parity (meaning it takes in to consideration differences in prices for the same product) as a wealth component. It also includes life expectancy at birth for a health component, and mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling to create an educated component. The index is sometimes improved by adjusting for inequalities between the three.<a href="/print/67245#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> In either case countries tend to be categorised into Very High, High, Medium (with this being split into lower and upper middle in the World Bank&rsquo;s) and Low. A country might be said to be fully developed when it reaches high. Development however might simply be taken as the movement between these categories.</p>
<p>Dictatorship does not automatically result in development &ndash; an increase in human wellbeing, which can be evidenced by improved education, health, lifestyles and security. Neither does democracy. There are cases both of democracies that have failed to develop, such as India and Bangladesh, and there are a lot of instances where autocracies have failed to develop. On the opposite side of the coin there are both cases where democracies have developed such as many western countries; the UK, US, France, and cases where states have developed under a more autocratic system such as South Korea, Singapore, and most recently China. It is China that is the driving force behind current debates on whether dictatorships might be better than democracies at encouraging at least the initial stages of growth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are however both advantages and disadvantages to each system when it comes to encouraging development. A dictatorship has greater control over people and resources allowing for more state driven economic growth, making it in a better position to develop than a democratic state. This is most evident in early stages of development where development is based on the production of goods. This debate will explore whether dictatorships are more likely to develop then democracies.</p>

                    <p>Dictatorships are superior to democracies in that they can make decisions and implement policies quicker. They can easily modify institutional and legal frameworks towards development goals, as there is no need for a political consensus behind their actions. This also insulates government from special interests that must be reconciled with in democracies. This allows dictatorships to create a pro-investment legal, economic and institutional framework such as low taxes, exchange rate manipulations and import tariffs, without facing political opposition.</p>
<p>For example, fracking, a technique used to extract hard to obtain gas, has generated widespread opposition in the West, leading to it being banned in France<a href="/print/67245#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. An autocratic government would find it easier to allow cheap access to this energy, boosting industry, as it could disregard this opposition.</p>
<p>Dictatorships can also control resources to allow for better health and education services, by determining curricula, salaries and supplies. Cuba has one of the best healthcare systems in the world, with more doctors per capita than much of the Western world<a href="/print/67245#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, and in 2009 Shanghai came first in the PISA test<a href="/print/67245#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>.</p>

                    <p>This makes the assumption that dictators are rational, wise and seek to encourage development, rather than operate as kleptocrats. This is why dictatorship usually does not benefit development; the very concentration of power means when they make poor decisions the effect on the country is much greater. There is a similar result with corruption, a lack of checks and balances mean that decisions can be taken and implemented quickly but this same lack also means there is little to prevent corruption.</p>
<p>Corruption is often rife in non-democratic societies. For example, in Cuba the healthcare system is largely reliant on bribery and is often under-resourced. One US diplomatic cable points out &ldquo;[i]n one Cuban hospital, patients had to bring their own light bulbs. In another, the staff used &quot;a primitive manual vacuum&quot; on a woman who had miscarried. In others, Cuban patients pay bribes to obtain better treatment.&rdquo;<a href="/print/67245#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>Due to the lack of rotation in office, a dictatorship allows for a more stable government with more ability to plan for the long term, which is crucial for attracting foreign investment.</p>
<p>Given that a democracy requires regular elections, each election can change the economic environment of a country. A change in government may lead to a switch in policies, partisan appointments to government bodies, and a medium term focus always set on the next election.</p>
<p>Close elections can lead to disorder as votes are recounted and appeals lodged in the courts. After the 2006 Mexican presidential election, tight results lead to popular unrest and mass protests calling for a recount. The president elect had to deal with a large legislative faction that did not recognise him, and his opponent refused to concede defeat.<a href="/print/67245#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Without a stable framework, the lack of foreign confidence may impede development. The countries that have developed rapidly have tended to be those that have managed to attract this foreign direct investment thus in 2012 China managed to get $243 billion of FDI (18% of the total) against only $175 billion for the United States which is still a much bigger economy.<a href="/print/67245#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>Additionally the resources needed to operate a democratic society and run elections are a large expense for the state and society as a whole; the US presidential election costs $6bn,<a href="/print/67245#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> money which would be much better spent investing in building infrastructure or businesses.</p>

                    <p>In addition to the moral concerns, it is not proven that dictatorships are sustainable in the long term. There will always be groups seeking a democratic government, which could lead to revolution.</p>
<p>There is a particular issue with handovers of power in dictatorships, especially those with personality cults &ndash; for example the transition to democracy after the death of Francisco Franco in 1975, or the collapse and disintegration of Yugoslavia in to ethnic conflict following the death of Tito. Many authoritarian regimes require a lot of upkeep in terms of propaganda which counterbalances the cost of elections<a href="/print/67245#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>An election may be costly but it is also a good indicator of the performance of a government, providing a mechanism of monitoring the performance of the &ldquo;social contract&rdquo;. Democratic governments are accountable to their people at the ballot box, which gives those in power an incentive to perform well. If the government is not performing well they will be thrown out. In an authoritarian country if the government performs badly the people have no way to remove them and so change policies to ones that work.</p>
<p>Dictatorships have a different problem with political stability and that is on a smaller scale; it is difficult to know if an investment is safe because the government is arbitrary not bound by the rule of law. The results of this may not be the sweeping changes in economic policy found in democracies but can be more significant locally such as demands for high payments to operate, confiscation, or preferential treatment for competitors.</p>

                    <p>Dictatorships are better at controlling discipline and order within society. They generally promote a state based on hierarchical values, through strict policies based on security. This allows them to prevent financial losses due to strikes and riots, and reduce crime rates, making the country more stable.</p>
<p>Singapore is a de-facto one party state, in which the ruling People&rsquo;s Action Party, is accused of stopping the operation of opposition parties. A former Foreign Minister of Singapore has asked &ldquo;How many Singaporeans really want free speech anyway? They want orderliness, a decent living&rdquo;<a href="/print/67245#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. This both makes the country more competitive because there are more productive days and more attractive to invest in as expats will want to live in countries with little crime. Moreover when it comes to attracting immigration for sectors of the economy there is none of the opposition that would occur in democracies.</p>
<p>Autocracy may be the only way to stabilize some countries that have never had a democratic government. It has been suggested by Mancur Olson, a leading economist, that &ldquo;anarchy not only involves loss of life but also increases the incentives to steal and to defend against theft, and thereby reduces the incentive to produce<a href="/print/67245#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>&rdquo;. A dictatorship may be the only way to restore order and create a political framework stable enough for trade and investment.</p>

                    <p>Dictatorships generally focus only on supporting one element of society, which means that there are often opposition groups from other demographics ready to oppose them. When the repression fails, the state will no longer be stable. Even if a dictatorship can create economic growth, it will not necessarily permeate through all elements of society, making them more likely to object to the government.</p>
<p>If a dictatorship manages to create an inclusive economy, demands for an inclusive political system will follow. While a dictatorship may work in the short term, political change will then result from this very success as shown by the countries like South Korea and Taiwan that grew rapidly as autocracies before having democratic revolutions.</p>
<p>According to Adam Smith, &ldquo;<em>&ldquo;[c]ommerce and manufactures can seldom ﬂourish long in any state which does not enjoy a regular administration of justice, in which the people do not feel themselves secure in the possession of their property, in which the faith of contracts is not supported by law, and in which the authority of the state is not supposed to be regularly employed in enforcing the payment of debts from all those who are able to pay. Commerce and manufactures, in short, can seldom ﬂourish in any state in which there is not a certain degree of conﬁdence in the justice of government&rdquo;<a href="/print/67245#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><strong>[1]</strong></a>.</em></p>

                    <p>In order for a society to develop economically, it needs a stable political framework and dictatorships are often less stable. A dictator will have to prioritize the retention of power. As repression is inevitable, a dictator will not necessarily be entirely popular. There will regularly be a doubt about the future and sustainability of a dictatorship.&nbsp; Bearing in mind the messy collapses of some dictatorships, a democracy may be a more stable form of government over the long term<a href="/print/67245#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Only democracies can create a stable legal framework. The rule of law ensures all of society has access to justice and the government acts within the law. Free and fair elections act as a bulwark against social unrest and violence. Economic freedoms and human rights protection also have positive effects on economies. Private property rights, for example, encourage productivity and innovation so that one has control of the fruits of their labour.</p>
<p>It has been argued by Acemolgu and Robinson in their book <em>Why Nations Fail? The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty</em> that inclusive political institutions and pluralistic systems that protect individual rights are necessary preconditions for economic development<a href="/print/67245#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. If these political institutions exist then the economic institutions necessary for growth will be created, as a result economic growth will be more likely.</p>

                    <p>It can be argued that a good economic policy, such as China&rsquo;s economic policies, have helped development. But a free market policy can be done with any form of government, and cannot be exclusively attached to a dictatorship or a democracy. Any political system can use it. Although it has been noted that South Korea was an autocracy during economic &lsquo;takeoff&rsquo; its economy has also grown significantly since democratization with GNI per capita growing from $3,320 in 1987 to $22,670 in 2012.<a href="/print/67245#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Another example is that Spanish economic growth in the 1950-2000 period. The 1960s economic miracle in Spain was not necessarily caused by Franco&rsquo;s regime &ndash; he controlled the country in the 1950s, when the country did not have such economic success. In 1959, Franco opened up the Spanish economy internationally, ending the isolationist economic policies established following the Civil War so making the country free market bringing dividends. As a result Spain also grew economically after the collapse of the Franco government, continuing on following on from EU membership.</p>

                    <p>Amartya Sen has argued that &ldquo;the removal of substantial unfreedoms [&hellip;] is constitutive of development [in so far as give people] the opportunity of exercising their reasoned agency<a href="/print/67245#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&rdquo;. In a broader sense, democracy is necessary for a developed society because a precondition of a developed society is for that society to be able to decide for itself what its objectives are. It is society as a whole that needs to define what it considers to be development. The Myanmar under the junta may have considered its goals to be a strong military showing that Burma was developed. But without the citizenry agreeing this would not make Burma a strong state. Quite the opposite the lack of freedoms would show the country is not actually developed. Development means more than economic growth, it has to include other indicators as in the Human Development Index, but also things that are not even captured by that measurement such as freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Economic growth and GDP are even worse at demonstrating which countries are developed. Development only occurs when the wealth, and the choices it brings, reaches the people which is why Equatorial Guinea is not a developed nation despite its high income. Even in the economic realm therefore it is not just the absolute growth that matters but how it is distributed. &nbsp;Przeworski and Limongi show that from 1951-1990 dictatorships had higher growth rates than democracies (4.42% against 3.95%) yet the growth rate in GDP per capita was higher in democracies (2.46% against 2%).<a href="/print/67245#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>Certain economic standards have to be met to genuinely satisfy individual autonomy and freedom. If economic growth is a necessity for democracy, dictatorships are better at gaining the required growth. If dictatorships grow faster while not redistributing wealth then at least there will be more wealth to redistribute when the state does eventually start to do so. It might therefore be considered once again that it is the autocratic state that sets the conditions for democracies to take over and increase development in the non-economic areas.&nbsp;</p>
