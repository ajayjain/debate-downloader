    <h1 class="print-title">This House would make the raising of business and labour standards a prerequisite for developmental aid</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Developmental aid exists in a variety of forms such as the Official Developmental Assistance (ODA) awarded by donor nations in the UN&rsquo;s Development Assistance Committee (DAC).&nbsp;&nbsp; These flows of official financing are given with the aim of &ldquo;promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective&hellip;&rdquo;.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Although there may be discussion over what parameters or index should be used to measure the overall development of a nation, the success of the awarded aid depends largely on the localised effects of the particular aid projects and any wider results that have been obtained. ODA often has strings attached to the aid, but this usually is conditions such as equipment having to be bought from the country that is providing the aid. There may sometimes be other conditions such as a country being unwilling to give development assistance to countries that have particularly poor human rights records, though this will almost certainly not apply to any emergency aid. For example the UK suspended aid to Rwanda at the end of 2012 in response to reports showing Rwanda was fueling the civil war in neighbouring Congo.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>This however does not usually translate into action in other similar areas. In the contexts of scarce accountability and poor labour standards, development aid often carries on regardless. This is despite International labour standards, being particularly suited to ensure that economic development remains concentrated on improving human life and dignity by making sure that economic growth and development go along with the creation of decent work<a href="/print/53313#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. In other words labour standards could be seen as a core part of any sustainable development that such aid is aiming to achieve. Should raising labour standards therefore, to increase the efficacy of aid, be considered a pre-requisite for development aid. Whether this is a fair, efficient and more importantly, achievable criterion to be met by developing nations is the keystone focus of this debate.</p>

                    <p>Labour and business standards are a cornerstone of agreement on universal human rights between various international actors and so it is right that they should be linked to aid. In 1998 the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work were adopted and are considered binding on all members regardless of whether they have ratified the conventions.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The business and labour regulations protect the basic worker rights and improve job security through demanding the elimination of discrimination and empower workers through the recognition of &ldquo;freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining&rdquo;<a href="/print/53313#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> like in those in developed western countries. This then provides a minimum standard and aid should only be given to those that ensure those minimum standards they have signed up. It would also help compliance to prioritise those who go further in their protections of labour when it comes to receiving aid. It should be remembered that there has been general acceptance of international labour standards not just for human rights reasons but also because having minimum standards is beneficial economically &ndash; for example a 40 hour working week is more productive per hour than a 60 hour week.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>

                    <p>Not all standards benefit human rights and some could even undermine individual&rsquo;s most basic human rights such as that to sustenance and shelter. Standards combating child labour, for example, could be misguided.&nbsp; In many developing countries, child labour is an important source of income for children&rsquo;s food and education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holding to the ILO&rsquo;s convention on child labour would therefore affect families&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s income and development opportunities. &nbsp;Since child labour is dependent on level of economic development, developing countries should work on combating poverty before reducing child labour.&nbsp; India implemented most international standards, including the convention for child labour. However, research has found that children working full time have better chances of making it to adulthood than those who work less, because they&rsquo;re better fed<a href="/print/53313#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Children&rsquo;s physical wellbeing will often therefore benefit from being allowed to work.</p>
<p>Rather than imposing labour standards the way to end such practices is to provide incentives that pay for parents to send their children to school as with the Bolsa Familia in Brazil.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>What are international labour and business standards? They are globally acceptable methods of doing business and employing labour. These include Conventions Against Forced Labour<a href="/print/53313#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, Discrimination<a href="/print/53313#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> and Child Labour<a href="/print/53313#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>.&nbsp; These also form guideline structures for social policy such as labour dispute resolution bodies, employment services and good industrial relations. Therefore, this goes hand in hand with reducing poverty and increasing the standard of living of the employees, and hence the standard is a facet of development in itself. This helps in achieving the goals of a stable long term plan for economic growth as well paid workers are necessary for consumer spending. Employing higher standards would be a way to tackle the problems with distribution of aid at the grassroots and increase efficiency within the system organically.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p>
<p>The poorest countries invariably have the lowest standards of labour and business. It is essential to raise these standards to an international level, implementing standards against practices like child labour. If this is done then the purpose of development aid, which is to increase the day to day standard of living of the people, will improve. In an absence of such a pre-requisite, a developing country will be free to employ standards that do not reflect the same principles of the donor nation. Thus, to avoid a hypocritical scenario, this pre-requisite is necessary.</p>

                    <p>Developing nations are plagued with corruption as well as desperate economic situations and are often in competition with each other in exporting whether that is manufacturing for slightly richer countries of South East Asia or natural resources in Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the context of such an economic rat race, it would be unfair to impose a western standard on these countries. An increase in standard is not a cheap process as it increases the costs of labour and will stretch resources resulting in cutting back the number of jobs and hence will increase unemployment and poverty just as happened in many Latin American countries<a href="/print/53313#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. It is better to employ many and provide some means of sustenance to all, as will happen with very low wages and standards, &nbsp;rather than employ less and give (relative) luxury to a few. Developing nations that have lower labour standards can gain a comparative advantage in trade: the lower the cost of the industry, greater the turnover of the industry. <a href="/print/53313#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>Increasing the required standard of business and labour will result in increases to the current standard labour and business standards even before aid is entirely tied as countries implement changes to ensure they get the most possible aid. &nbsp;Simply setting an expected level of labour and business standards will therefore create improvement in those standards. In the case of the Decent Work Country Programme for Bangladesh 2006-2009 Bangladesh has been implementing the program due to its positive benefit towards achieving the millennium development goals. This is despite challenges such as the lack of employment opportunities in the country.

                    <p>This is a common logical fallacy. With limited resources, there is a limited bandwidth within which one can stretch the standard above the capable standard. It is not favourable to increase this gap too much for then it is not realistic. Many countries have ratified ILO Conventions but not implemented any of it.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> For example India has ratified both ILO core conventions on discrimination but domestic laws have not managed to curtail the widespread discrimination on the basis of caste, particularly for being a Dalit, gender, and ethnicity.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>It is important that the standards not only need to be raised, but rather the current standards need to be implemented better &ndash; which means a stricter hand to the current regulations.</p>

                    <p>When a donor nation parts with foreign aid for development to a nation, it must always choose who it prefers to give it to as there is a limited pot of money to donate there needs to be a way of allocating it. It is not surprising therefore that countries with shared colonial histories tend to dominate aid flows, thus Britain has historically given most aid to countries that were its colonies; in 1960 Malta and Cyprus received most, while India was the biggest recipient for much of the rest of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Further, often countries offering aid, such as the US, the UK, and the EU, require the pre-requisite of democracy or the start of a democratisation process.

                    <p>Strategic interests can be put to risk by such pre-requisites. Donor nations have strategic interests when awarding aid, which ensure that future trade relations are well secured (such as United States and the Middle Eastern oil states). This is why aid goes to countries that often have links with the donor.</p>
<p>If there are too many conditions attached and when the developing countries cannot meet them these countries will go elsewhere. China is increasingly a competitor in giving aid and overtly at least ties in far fewer conditions into the aid they give.

                    <p>Developing countries are in a race to develop their economies. The prioritisation of countries that are not currently developed is different to the priorities of developed countries as a result of their circumstances and they must be allowed to temporarily push back standards of labour and business until they achieve a level playing field with the rest of the world. This is because economic development is a necessary precondition for many of the kinds of labour standards enjoyed in the west. For there to be high labour standards there clearly needs to be employment to have those standards. Undeveloped countries are reliant upon cheap, flexible, labour to work in factories to create economic growth as happened in China. In such cases the comparative advantage is through their cheap labour. If there had been high levels of government imposed labour standards and working conditions then multinational firms would never have located their factories in the country as the cost of running them would have been too high.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Malaysia for example has struggled to contain activity from the Malaysian Trades Union Congress to prevent their jobs moving to China<a href="/print/53313#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> as the competition does not have labour standards so helping keep employment cheap.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>

                    <p>Achieving development at the cost of principles of development is not acceptable. The means by which you achieve development is equally important, and will remain integral in the principles and priorities of a nation once it achieves developed status.

                    <p>The chances that these international labour standards are even relevant to these developing nations are low. For example, India need not ratify the two core conventions on protecting trade union rights because these are rights that pertain to workers in formal employment. A majority of India&rsquo;s workforce is not in formal employment, and hence not covered by any legal provisions. Similarly in many developing economies a large portion of the workforce is engaged in subsistence farming, something that labour standards are never going to apply to as those involved will do whatever they need to in order to get by. Therefore, there needs to be a different standard applied to the situation specific problems. What needs to be recognised is how no to low labour standards in developing countries can be a significant improvement over the only alternative that was previously available; subsistence farming. One size fits all does not work in such a diverse global economy and donors should recognise the benefits of helping development to bring people out of subsistence farming.</p>

                    <p>Individualised standards can be dangerous. International standards could be set at a minimum level on which every country could add measures tailored to its needs as is the case with the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Countries tend to ignore the importance on long term development and concentrate on plans for relatively short term success. By neglecting important issues countries suffer because they wake up when the issue at hand is too large to handle. For example, China&rsquo;s economy has grown tenfold since 1978 but at the cost of great environmental damage. China now hosts 16 of the 20 most polluted cities of the world. The country has also landed itself with over 70% of its natural water sources polluted and is now the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.<a href="/print/53313#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Encouraging greener development earlier would have helped prevent this problem.</p>

It is unfair to back a developing nation up against a wall and force them to ratify higher standards in return for aid.</p>
<p>It is notable that the countries that have developed fastest have often been those that have ignored the whims of the aid donors. The Asian tigers (Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, later followed by South East Asia and China) did not receive aid, but preserved authority over their developmental policies. Their success story does not involve the international labour standards and goes against many of the policy prescriptions, such as free trade, of international institutions, such as the World Bank and the ILO<a href="/print/53313#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.

                    <p>It is irrelevant that some western countries do not always meet the highest labour standards; does it matter that Germany does not have a national minimum wage when there are minimum wages for each sector? These are countries where one labour standard can be sacrificed because the pay and standards elsewhere are much higher.</p>
<p>Of course consumers should be supporting attempts to increase labour and business standards but this is hardly exclusive; there is little reason for aid donors not to be demanding high standards at the same time as consumers are.</p>
