    <h1 class="print-title">This House supports the Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>In the abstract, bankruptcy occurs when an individual or an organisation is unable to repay sums of money that it has been lent by other individuals or organisations. Formally recognised and regulated debts are often repaid over an extended period of time, with borrowers paying portions of the principal sum alongside an agreed amount of interest. If a borrower cannot meet these obligations, they will be declared bankrupt; creditors will be repaid from the sale of the borrower’s assets – the tangible and intangible property that the borrower owns.</p><p>If a company is unable to meet its debts, its assets will be sold in order to repay its creditors – a process known as “liquidation”. Normally, this process will lead to the company being wound up. Its employees will be laid off, trading in its shares will cease and the administrators supervising the company’s bankruptcy will negotiate with its customers and suppliers to release from its existing contractual obligations. For all practical purposes the company will cease to exist. “Traditional” bankruptcies are an everyday feature of</p><p>Chapter 11 of the United States bankruptcy code offers businesses approaching bankruptcy an alternate approach to dealing with excessive and unserviceable debts. Rather than permitting the sale or seizure of a business’s assets, Chapter 11 allows the business to continue trading while a court supervises the reorganisation of its debts. Some debts may be reduced, others excused entirely. The process of restructuring may also involve a rehabilitation of the business’s operations, staffing and union agreements and management structures. It is intended that businesses that submit to Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings will re-emerge a viable commercial entities once the changes specified by its creditors, stock holders and the courts has run its course.</p><p>The creation of the Chapter 11 measures was partly motivated by to create an economically efficient response to business failure. The American congress, debating the amendments that created the Chapter 11 protections, recognised that a struggling business might be more valuable if it were permitted to continue trading, rather than being reduced to a collection of disparate assets, the sale of which would be unlikely to meet the full value of creditors’ debts in any event. Chapter 11 remains very much creditor oriented, however. Creditors of businesses administered in this way are effectively given full ownership of its assets; former owners and operators become “debtors in possession”. Any significant decisions taken on the future or operation of the business must be approved by the bankruptcy courts and by committees and trustees appointed to oversee creditors’ interests. Lawyers acting on behalf of creditors may compel managers and owners to adopt new business practices and strategies.</p><p>Modifications made to Chapter 11 in 2006 were intended to prevent creditors and business owners threatening the complete liquidation of a company in order to coerce workers and unions into accepting redundancies and reductions in wages and pension payments.</p><p>Even before the bank crisis of 2008 and the ensuing global recession, several large, high profile US companies made use of Chapter 11 filings to reorganise their debt obligations and operations. Examples include petrochemicals firm Texaco corp, United Airlines and Delta Airlines. The collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2009 was administered under Chapter 11, although operations of the bank itself were ultimately terminated.</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-editors">

                    <p>Western liberal democratic economies are no longer able to rely on large scale manufacturing, natural resources extraction, shipping or heavy industry to provide jobs and growth. The creation of knowledge and service economies and the movement of mining and manufacturing activities to the developing world mean that the economies of Europe, the United Kingdom and America are now driven by innovation and research. Western economies are reliant on the creation of new forms of product and service and the refinement of existing ones.</p><p>Although an economy of this type makes the best use of the high liquidity and highly educated workforces of liberal democratic countries, it also carries with it a high burden of risk. Research- into power generation, into pharmaceuticals- may not yield results within a predictable period of time. It may not produce any useful knowledge at all.</p><p>However viable a particular project may seem, technology, IT and pharmaceutical companies must habituate themselves to risk taking in order to remain competitive and relevant within their respective markets. Western nations are no longer in a position where they can rely on simple, easily modelled forms of economic production. Consequently, it is necessary to adopt an approach to corporate debt and bankruptcy that allows high risk development and research to be pursued freely, and for successful projects to be fully realised.</p><p>Bankruptcy laws in the United Kingdom and Europe impose onerous penalties on businesses and business owner that are unable to meet the demands of their creditors. Floundering businesses are rapidly liquidated by creditors, while the executives and directors of bankrupt firms may find themselves made personally or criminally liable for failed businesses<a href="/print/17807#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>. A business’s bankruptcy can result in its owners losing homes, being barred from holding directorial positions<a href="/print/17807#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> and prevented from obtaining credit for any purpose<a href="/print/17807#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a>.</p><p>Allowing such an inflexible approach to dominate a business environment where growth is dependent on companies’ willingness to engage in research and experimentation- on their willingness to take risks- will have a chilling effect. Men and women with bright ideas will be afraid to pursue them. The dynamism evident in the United States’ economy has been fostered, in part, by Chapter 11.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17807#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> Insolvency Act 1986 (England, Wales and Northern Ireland).

                    <p>The existence of Chapter 11 protections incentivises excessive risk taking within businesses. Risks taken on investing in the creation of new products, in expanding a business’s operations or diversifying the services it offers all incur large amounts of debt – research and expansion need to be funded, after all. Taking on too much risk can produce an excess of debt with no guarantee that it will be serviceable.</p><p>Chapter 11 removes much of the burden of risk taking from businesses’ owners and operators. The likelihood of receiving the courts’ assistance when insolvency looms is now habitually factored into executive decision making. This, in turn, motivates taking risks more frequently than an open market would otherwise reward.</p><p>Moreover, senior managers often retain their positions following a Chapter 11 filing, overseeing the reorganisation of the company that they have helped to lay low. There are moral objections to this practice. Why should an incompetent executive be given an opportunity to launder his reputation at the cost of securing a replacement with specialist skills in reviving ailing firms?</p><p>So entrenched is the use of incumbent managers to oversee Chapter 11 administration that it took the creditors of the failed communications firm WorldCom three months to oust John Sidgmore, a COO tied directly to the $11 billion accountancy fraud that caused the firm’s collapse<a href="/print/17807#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>.</p><p>The tradition began during 1980s, following a series of bankruptcies linked to excessive borrowing to finance takeovers and mergers. Debts incurred by the predecessors of incumbent executives in many large firms were out of control, but day-to-day operations remained viable and potentially profitable<a href="/print/17807#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>. Companies had been exposed to risk by a previous generation of executives, who held little to no influence over the current generation. It made sense to retain competent decision makers, rather than disrupting the functioning of companies for the sake of deals entered into a decade earlier.</p><p>The causes of contemporary corporate bankruptcies are much more diverse. The consequences of excessive risk taking take less time to become apparent – firms can go bust much more rapidly than before. Improved regulation and oversight has eliminated the dangers inherent in large scale investment, buyouts and corporate fund-raising<a href="/print/17807#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a>. The majority of Chapter 11 filings are now the result of mismanagement and recklessness affecting the running of a business itself. They are linked to the failure of executives and managers to understand the market that they are trading in. This is best illustrated by the decline of United Airlines, which had hired a succession of CEOs from the oil, motor and paper industries immediately prior to its decision to file for Chapter 11 protection<a href="/print/17807#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a>.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17807#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> Obituary, John Sidgmore.

                    <p>Chapter 11 encourages a sober, measured approach to corporate planning. The onerous results of a European-style bankruptcy encourage businesses to avoid negotiating with their creditors when their debts become unmanageable. Chapter 11 protection has always been awarded on a discretionary basis. A bankruptcy judge will only allow a company to continue trading as a going concern if he is satisfied that its failure to meet its debts was not caused by poor or corrupt management or by excessive and reckless risk taking. Further, the creditors and stockholders of a firm making a chapter 11 filing must agree on any recovery plan that its owners and operators put forward, and are given the opportunity to alter and amend the strategy that the company will use to return to solvency.</p><p>In the absence of Chapter 11 style protection, English and European managers and executives have demonstrated a tendency to engage in increasingly extreme forms of behaviour as their companies draw closer to insolvency. Leaders have little or no disincentive from taking extreme risks, even where the chance of these turning a company’s finances around is slim; and “all or nothing” approach predominates.

Successful chapter 11 applications are often dependent on a company being able to prove that it has sufficient cash and orders to meet short term financial obligations; the American courts have previously made clear that there preoccupation is with medium to long-term debt. One of the core objectives of Chapter 11 is to remove perverse incentives for managers to engage in desperate behaviour; to prevent a business that might be viable in the long term from collapsing due to the law’s otherwise inflexible approach to debt.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17807#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> “MG Rover: What Next?” BBC News Online, 22 April 2005,&nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/have_your_say/4450229.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/have_your_say/4450229.stm</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Far from encouraging sobriety and forward planning among a business’s executive class, strategic bankruptcy is often used to coerce stakeholders in a company into accepting unpopular or flawed decisions<a href="/print/17807#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>.</p><p>Consider United Airlines, which was able to employ a chapter 11 bankruptcy to trump the objections of employees’ unions to wide ranging pay cuts. As employees and unions owned 55% of the company’s stock, they would ordinarily have been able to block such measures.<a href="/print/17807#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a></p><p>Further, there are a range of perverse incentives attached to Chapter 11 that actively reward executives who initiate the process. In subtle and not-so-subtle ways, this leads to conflict between the interests of a company’s leaders and those of the company itself. It is impossible to certain that the decision to file for Chapter 11 has been taken in good faith.<a href="/print/17807#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a></p><p>Many high-profile Chapter 11 filings have been accompanied by the payment of “retention bonuses” to “key workers” – shorthand for senior managers and executives. These bonuses are intended to reward corporate leaders for risking their livelihoods and reputations by sticking with ailing firms in order to steer them back toward profitability. This rationale rapidly falls apart contrasted with the arguments set out above. Executives are now much more likely to have had some hand in the failure of the companies that they run. There is little that is magnanimous or selfless about a decision to file for Chapter 11.</p><p>In addition, lawyers and accountants who specialise in corporate bankruptcy can create command high fees for supervising the Chapter 11 process. Large swathes of what, by rights, should be creditors’ and shareholders’ cash can be consumed by legal experts brought in to create reorganisation plans. Before it was finally liquidated, the Enron corporation spent two years under Chapter 11 administration, which resulted in a final legal bill in excess of $700 million<a href="/print/17807#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a>.

                    <p>Chapter 11 can help to protect the interests of both creditors and a business’s other stakeholders, such as employees, suppliers and pension schemes. Traditional processes of liquidation are designed to quickly wind up a company while disposing of its assets in as profitable a fashion as possible. This, inevitably, results in job losses and may also lead to the collapse of pension funds. There may also be any number of small suppliers who are reliant on a bankrupt company’s business who may be adversely affected by the decision to liquidate.</p><p>It is partly true that a bankruptcy administered under Chapter 11 often takes longer to discharge creditors’ debts. However, the benefits of paying creditors off faster, or of allowing creditors to recover fractionally more of the sums leant to a company are outweighed by a Chapter 11-style reorganisation’s ability to do justice to those who are dependent on the company in other ways.</p><p>Employees’ interests are protected through the continuation of their employment. Apprentices and junior professionals on training contracts will be able to complete their qualifications. Concurrently, local communities will also avoid the burden of a sudden, localised rise in unemployment. Suppliers can continue to contract with the company in the medium term; Chapter 11 guarantees payment on orders sent to a company by suppliers during the first twenty days before it files for Chapter 11 protection. Small, peripheral creditors, who are unable to afford the intensive legal counsel enjoyed by large banks, stand a greater chance of seeing their debts repaid if the company can be returned to profitability, rather than dismantled to service its weightiest debts.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Shareholders interests do not receive sufficient protection under the Chapter 11 regime. Stockholders usually rank last in the order of priorities for repaying those with a financial stake in a company, and this is no different under Chapter 11.</p><p>However, a Chapter 11 agreement can directly involve a court in the pre-emptive removal or reduction of stockholders rights to their own property (the share they hold in the company).</p><p>As noted by the proposition, a company need not have exhausted all of its cash reserves, or all of its restructuring options, before filing for Chapter 11. The use of Chapter 11 in this way is technically dependent on the agreement of both shareholders and creditors. In practice, judges can and have overruled shareholders’ objections to reorganisations; judges are only bound to consider whether a reorganisation plan treats stockholders “fairly” in relation to creditors and other interested parties – a highly subjective requirement.<a href="/print/17807#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p>The US Securities and Exchanges Commission warns shareholders that “In most instances, [a] company's plan of reorganization will cancel existing equity shares. This happens in bankruptcy cases because secured and unsecured creditors are paid from the company's assets before common stockholders. In situations where shareholders do participate in the plan, their shares are usually subject to substantial dilution.”<a href="/print/17807#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a></p><p>It is not fair that the interests of creditors and bondholders should be put ahead of those of shareholders in this way, especially where Chapter 11 is used as a strategic measure, rather than as a last resort.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17807#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> “What every investor should know: Corporate Bankruptcy“.

                    <p>Companies who successfully seek the assistance of the courts in avoiding liquidation are not likely to be “reborn”, as distinctly different, more competitive entities in the manner suggested by the proposition. Frequently, Chapter 11 serves only to keep companies reliant on out of date business practices and unattractive products active in the marketplace. Although a bankrupt business’s approach to its debts may be reformed, promises of wide-ranging change frequently fall by the wayside. This marginal improvement in the competitiveness of a bankrupt firm can have a knock on impact on smaller businesses that would normally step into the gap it left in the market.</p><p>Smaller, solvent businesses will be left to contend with a rival who benefits from the reduction or suspension of its debt interest by the bankruptcy courts. Smaller businesses will be prevented from using customers and contacts left over from the liquidation of a competitor to grow and develop. An efficient economy is characterised by the recycling and refinement of failed businesses and their assets. Novel or more stable approaches to the industry in which the Chapter 11 business and its rivals trade may be suppressed by the continued existence of a dominant but inefficient brand. Meanwhile, small competitor firms are themselves exposed to an increased risk of insolvency, as interest rates rise in response to the inability of lenders tied to a particular industry to realise the security of loans made to the Chapter 11 company. Lenders make less money from a Chapter 11 corporation, so must spread costs elsewhere.</p><p>The existence of a large company benefitting from Chapter 11 protection within a marketplace that contains a plurality of rival companies reduces competition. Rivals are prevented seeking new customers or contracting with suppliers with industry experience. The burden of intractable Chapter 11 debt is also passed on to those rivals, in the form of higher borrowing costs.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Far from distorting competition, companies frequently enter bankruptcy because they have become uncompetitive. Most businesses enter bankruptcy when their customer numbers have already fallen to unsustainable levels. Many businesses are built on the bones of their predecessors, but this is not the central pillar of market capitalism – more a useful externality.</p><p>The opposition creates an image of a world dominated by “life support” businesses that fall in and out of bankruptcy without ever being allowed to fail completely. This is deceptive. The decision to discharge a company from Chapter 11 bankruptcy still rests with its creditors, and they are unlikely to allow a company to continue to exist, or to renegotiate the terms of its recovery plan if it shows no sign of being viable once it returns to the market place. The Enron corporation voluntarily liquidated after a prolonged Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p><p>Often, the purpose of seeking bankruptcy protection is to ensure a clean and orderly exit from a marketplace. Chapter 11 offers a more humane approach to the organisation of redundancies than a simple liquidation. It was designed to be a flexible piece of legislation, suitable to the wide range of circumstances that can lead a company toward failure.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Incompetent and irresponsible management will often lead a company into bankruptcy. However, Chapter 11 may actively reward such conduct. The use of the courts to keep insolvent businesses’ creditors in check also allows those businesses to restructure in a way that gives them a significant advantage over solvent, well run companies.</p><p>The ability of a company to lower prices on goods or services in order to make itself more attractive to its rival’s customers is partly determined by the scale and size of its debt obligations. Lenders will attempt to realise their securities if payments are not met, and this limits the extent to which a company can reduce its prices. As almost all companies within a particular sector rely on credit to some extent, it is difficult for an established company to radically undercut others. Offering vastly cheaper alternatives to existing products and services is often the preserve of newer businesses, such as easyJet and JetBlue within the airline industry, or TalkTalk within the consumer telecoms market.</p><p>As Chapter 11 agreements allow the courts to excuse the repayment of some of a business’s loans, and to suspend repayment on others, debtors-in-possession are no longer subject to the financial restraints that normally prevent them from undercutting. As result, businesses may seek to satisfy their creditor-owners, and bring about a quick return to profitability, by starting a price war with their competitors. A sudden reduction in airfares, the prices of mechanical parts or consumer electronics could force solvent competitors to focus on matching the prices charged by their bankrupt neighbour. Not only could this strategy lead to radical cost-cutting across entire sectors of industry, attended by job losses and the cancellation of research projects and expansion plans, it could force otherwise healthy, well-managed businesses into bankruptcy too.</p><p>The combined effects of radical price cutting by a chapter 11 company could have an impact on the long term profitability of the industry that that company operates within. As the Economist reported in 2002, such was the concern that businesses might respond to a successful application for Chapter 11 in this way, the American airline industry collectively requested government financial assistance following the World Trade Centre attacks in order to avoid “a wave of chapter 11 bankruptcies”.<a href="/print/17807#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> Airlines allowed to go bust in the last months of 2001 could potentially have seized on an opportunity to compete against budget carriers by drastically reducing ticket prices, without risking the ire of their creditors. This would have resulted in other airlines engaging in the accelerated cost cutting described above, reducing the profitability of the industry as a whole without any corresponding positive effects, such as significant gains in passenger volume or serious reforms to business practices</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17807#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> “Cruel Phoenix“.

                    <p>Business models change. This is a fact of life for businesses working in liberal democratic economies. This is clearly illustrated by the tension that currently exists between traditional and low-cost airlines. There is, potentially, space for both types of business in the market, but not in the numbers that currently exist. The effects of innovations within a market on existing players are highly unpredictable. Solvent or insolvent, it is likely that companies that have become too attached to a particular way of doing business will be forced into a confrontation sooner or later anyway.</p><p>Price wars of the type envisioned by the opposition erupted between European telecoms and television providers in the early two thousands. They resulted in the liquidation of Marconi, one of the world’s oldest electronics firms, along with the splitting up of British telecom and the radical restructuring of ITV and a number of other communications providers. This situation was not prompted by external circumstances of the type that caused the crisis in the airline industry in 2001, and was not influenced by any form of bankruptcy protection.</p><p>The growth and development of businesses is not reliably characterised by slow, collectively organised change. Sometimes change is violent and unexpected and has a severe impact on the profitability and efficiency of that business. More often than not employees bear the burden of such changes. It is unrealistic to centrally organise business activities in the way in which corporate socialists once attempt to do; the only way in which the state can protect workers from the damaging externalities of the free market is through dynamic and flexible debt management regimes such as Chapter 11.</p><p>Opposition are attempting to portray a set of laws that effectively mitigate the worst effects of business failure as a potential cause of that failure.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The creation and amendment of Chapter 11 appears to have been influenced by the needs of established, large scale businesses. Much of the discussion surrounding chapter 11 assumes that the types of creditors affected by a filing will be sophisticated financial institutions. It is argued that businesses that specialise in providing risk capital- loans, in other words- will be able to protect themselves through measures such as insurance, portfolio diversification and default swaps. This is not always the case.</p><p>Many start-up and medium sized businesses are dependent on small creditors. These creditors include trade partners and customers who pay in advance3 for goods that never arrive. Start up capital may have been sought from Community Interest organisations, family, friends and other small businesses. Collectively, these lenders constitute a class of creditor that simply cannot afford the sophisticated forms of protection available to large banks. It is unjust and unrealistic to expect business networks of this type to endure the risks inherent in the extended process of Chapter 11 administration.</p><p>Traditional bankruptcy recognises that there are diverse source of credit within a developed economy, and that the most effective way of protecting creditors from the effects of insolvency is through the fast and efficient liquidation and distribution of assets.</p>        </div>

An employee who chooses to work for a start up, or for a company with a shaky reputation exposes himself to risk. However, a permanent job is the primary means of subsistence for most adults within a capitalist society, and it is difficult to predict when and where employment will be available. The owners of capital generally have more control and choice in how that capital is applied than a worker has control and choice over how his labour and skills are applied.</p><p>Employment is a necessity within a capitalist economy, and choosing to reject an offer of a job can be as much of a risk as accepting a position with a financially unstable company.</p><p>Moreover, investors are able to demand the disclosure of certain information from companies seeking capital. Prospective employees are in a much weaker bargaining position, and are unable to acquire information about the financial health of a company they are considering joining.</p><p>The decision not to invest in a company means that a potential creditor has the luxury of seeking another borrower, or putting his money to a different use.
