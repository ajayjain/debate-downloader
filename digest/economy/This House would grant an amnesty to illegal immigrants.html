    <h1 class="print-title">This House would grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>An Amnesty can be defined as ‘a general pardon, esp for offences against a government���.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In the case of illegal immigrants this would be for the offence of entering and remaining in a country illegally and would in most cases not apply to those who have committed other crimes so there is usually an emphasis that an amnesty would only be for those who are law abiding – except for being in the country illegally. Amnesties may be granted by the executive or the legislature for a country, in the case of a general amnesty for migrants this would probably need both and would likely be a highly controversial move in any country. Politics about illegal immigrants are likely to be more highly charged in countries that already have a lot of migrants (whether legal or illegal) which means that migration is considered an social and economic issue that affects much of the electorate.</p><p>Despite their potential for controversy amnesties for illegal immigrants are not uncommon. Poland granted an amnesty for illegal immigrants in 2011,<a href="/print/18114#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Newt Gingrich has made some kind of amnesty part of his campaign for the republican nomination for the Presidency in the United States<a href="/print/18114#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> and it was also a campaign pledge in the in the UK general election by the Liberal Democrats in 2010.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> While the UK has never granted a general amnesty and the United States has only had one in some countries they are quite common; France and Portugal have offered two each, Italy five and Spain six amnesties.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p><p>The proposition in the debate would have to give some idea of what conditions they are attaching to the amnesty and whether there are any limitations on it. Often more there are proposals for more limited amnesties rather than a general amnesty in order to reduce the political backlash that could result from a more indiscriminate policy.</p><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <em>Collins Free Dictionary</em>, ‘amnesty’, thefreedictionary.com, 2003, <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/amnesty" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/amnesty">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/amnesty</a></p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Bronowicka, Joanna, ‘Poland announces amnesty for illegal immigrants’, <em>Reuters</em>, 29 December 2011, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/29/us-poland-immigrants-idUSTRE7BS11W20111229" title="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/29/us-poland-immigrants-idUSTRE7BS11W20111229">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/29/us-poland-immigrants-idUSTRE7B...</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Geiger, Kim, ‘Gingrich ‘prepared to take the heat’ with talk of amnesty’, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, 22 November 2011, &nbsp;http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/22/news/la-pn-gingrich-amnesty-20111122</p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> Standford Daniel, ‘Illegal immigration: Is an amnesty the answer’, <em>BBC News</em>, 19 April 2010, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/parties_and_issues/8629354.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/parties_and_issues/8629354.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/parties_and_issues/...</a></p></div><div id="ftn5"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> ‘An amnesty for illegal immigrants?’, <em>Migration Watch UK</em>, 21 May 2006, <a href="http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/Briefingpaper/document/131" title="http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/Briefingpaper/document/131">http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/Briefingpaper/document/131</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-text field-field-debate-authors">

                    <p>Amnesty is the only way to deal with the fundamental problem behind immigration; the developed world much richer and has more jobs available than the developing world. For example the USA has a per capita GDP of $48,100<a href="/print/18114#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> by comparison Mexico’s is only $15,100<a href="/print/18114#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> using PPP the gap with the Central American countries to the south of Mexico is even starker with Guatemalan GDP/capita at $5,000.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Not surprisingly the USA far outstrips the Central American countries in the Human development index; the US is 4th, Mexico 57th and Guatemala 131st.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> So long as there is such diversity of income and opportunity immigrants will keep coming, and this will continue no matter what the state that is receiving migrants does in an attempt to deter them.</p><p>Amnesties will help allow labour to get to where it is needed, through NAFTA the US is integrating North America but it is specifically excluding labour from this integration while tightening border controls at the Mexican border. Amnesties would help to counter-act the problems caused by leaving labour as the resource that is not allowed to cross borders and so provide benefits to both the host economy and the country of origin for the migrants. This is because the migrants will send back remittances that will help to develop their home nation and they themselves may well return after developing new skills that can then be put to use at home.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="file:///C:/Users/ahelling/Dropbox/Debatewise%20-%20DC/IDEA/Debatewise%20-%20Web%20Site/Merging/completed%20debates/Alex%20Helling/The%20World%20Factbook,%20'United%20States',%20Central%20Intelligence%20Agency,%2015%20February%202012,%20https:/www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html">The World Factbook, ‘United States’, <em>Central Intelligence Agency</em>, 15 February 2012, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> The World Factbook, ‘Mexico’, <em>Central Intelligence Agency</em>, 21 February 2012, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mx.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mx.html</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> The World Factbook, ‘Guatemala’, Central Intelligence Agency, 21 February 2012, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gt.html" title="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gt.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gt.html</a></p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> United Nations Development Programme, ‘Human Development Index’, 2011, <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/">http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>An amnesty will not solve this problem either; all it will do is move poor people from one country to another. Those granted an amnesty might be slightly higher paid than they would be if they had stayed at home but without skills they will remain at the bottom of the pile while having to adapt to a new nation. Instead what is needed is economic growth in the poorer countries that are the origin of the migrants. This is something the rich world can encourage through numerous different methods. For example the USA allowed Mexico to join the North American Free Trade Agreement and so the US is Mexico's biggest export partner with 80% of Mexican exports being to America. Secondly rich countries can provide investment and the skills necessary to develop industries in these developing countries. For example Mexico has "structural inefficiencies" in its farming industry,<a href="/print/18114#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> something which the United States as the world's most efficient agricultural producer could help with.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, ‘Background Note: Mexico’, <em>U.S. Department of State</em>, 16 November 2011, <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35749.htm" title="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35749.htm">http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35749.htm</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Migrants, including illegal migrants, are necessary for the economies of rich countries. There are schemes run by these countries that allow the migration of skilled workers for jobs where there is a skills shortage in the native population, for example the United Kingdom takes in a lot of migrants to work as doctors and migrants. However these schemes fail to acknowledge that migrants are also vital for unskilled jobs which native workers are often unwilling to take; for example jobs in catering, picking crops and cleaning. Approximately 6.3 million illegal immigrants are working in the USA, and these are benefiting the economy.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas says “The pace of recent U.S. economic growth would have been impossible without immigration. Since 1990, immigrants have contributed to job growth in three main ways: They fill an increasing share of jobs overall, they take jobs in labor-scarce regions, and they fill the types of jobs native workers often shun.”<a href="/print/18114#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Amnesties are necessary to ensure the economy keeps benefiting from these workers.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Goyle, Rajeev, and Jaeger, David A., ‘Deporting the Undocumented: A Cost Assessment’<em>, Center for American Progress</em>, July 2005, p.9. <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/kf/deporting_the_undocumented.pdf" title="http://www.americanprogress.org/kf/deporting_the_undocumented.pdf">http://www.americanprogress.org/kf/deporting_the_undocumented.pdf</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Orrenius, Pia M., ‘U.S. Immigration and Economic Growth: Putting Policy on Hold’, <em>Southwest Economy</em>, Issue 6, Nov./Dec. 2003, <a href="http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2003/swe0306a.html" title="http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2003/swe0306a.html">http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2003/swe0306a.html</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Much of the rich world is aging, and in a few cases is close to having a declining population. As a result the size of the available workforce will decrease. For example in Germany by 2050 a third of the population will be over 60,<a href="/print/18114#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> and over the next 15 years will as a result loose five million workers from the current workforce of 41 million.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> While increasing retirement age can mean that these reductions in the size of the workforce come later to maintain the size of the workforce immigration or a rapid increase in birth rate is necessary. These countries in order to maintain the size of their economies will therefore either have to rapidly increase productivity, which itself may not be easy as they are already the most productive nations, or else allow migrants to fill the gaps in the labour force. At the same time there will be an increase in some jobs that rely on migrants such as care workers to help look after the increasing number of elderly.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Ripperger, Sabine, ‘The Challenge of Demographic Change in Old, Shrivelling Europe’, Deutche-Welle, <a href="http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1865419,00.html" title="http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1865419,00.html">http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1865419,00.html</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Elliott, Larry, and Kollewe, Julia, ‘Germany faces up to problem of ageing workforce’, <em>guardian.co.uk, </em>17 March 2011, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/17/new-europe-germany-retirement-pensions-exports" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/17/new-europe-germany-retirement-pensions-exports">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/17/new-europe-germany-retiremen...</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Martin, Susan, et al., ‘The Role of Migrant Care Workers in Aging Societies: Report on Research Findings in the United States’, <em>Institute for the Study of International Migration</em>, December 2009, p.vii, <a href="http://www12.georgetown.edu/sfs/docs/20101201_Elder_Care_Report.pdf" title="http://www12.georgetown.edu/sfs/docs/20101201_Elder_Care_Report.pdf">http://www12.georgetown.edu/sfs/docs/20101201_Elder_Care_Report.pdf</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>&nbsp;Far from being necessary immigrants are a drain on the economy. The vast majority of immigrants have few skills. These low skill migrants pay few taxes and take a lot of government benefits. For example in the United States each immigrant without a high school diploma costs the US taxpayers $89,000 over their lifetime. Since there are six million illegals without a high school diploma living in the US this adds up to half a trillion dollars. This increases further if they are given an amnesty so are able to claim citizenship and more money and the costs spiral yet further when the cost of educating their children is included with the possible cost rising to $2 trillion.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Some migrants may be necessary as a country ages, but the state should pick the migrants it wants - if a state wants migrants with skills to work in care homes it should let in those who have those skills or are applying to colleges to learn the relevant&nbsp; skills rather than granting an amnesty to those who are already here regardless of their worth to the economy.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Rector, Robert, ‘Importing Poverty: Immigration and Poverty in the United States: A Book of Charts’<em>, The Heritage Foundation</em>, 25th October 2006, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/immigration/sr9.cfm#_ftn3" title="http://www.heritage.org/research/immigration/sr9.cfm#_ftn3">http://www.heritage.org/research/immigration/sr9.cfm#_ftn3</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>An amnesty by its very definition is letting someone who has engaged in an illegal act off the hook. It is letting criminal activity pay. It is also an admission of government defeat; other options have failed and there are still lawbreakers who are not being deported as they should be so there is a need for an amnesty. These people who have entered the country illegally, and have worked illegally are then being forgiven for their having broken the law.

                    <p>An amnesty is not a reward for breaking the law, and any illegal immigrant who has committed crimes other than entering the country illegally could be excluded. Instead amnesty should be seen as acknowledging those who live and work in a country but are nonetheless ignored. An amnesty would mean the state would get to collect more money in taxes from immigrants and they would be subject to all the requirements that all citizens are expected to abide by. They could also be expected to pay a processing fee to cover town or government expenditure for the amnesty amongst other things. So an amnesty wouldn't be a reward in its entirety as much as an acknowledgment and a way to balance the books.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The government would also be free to impose strict restrictions on any amnesty. For example the one proposed by the liberal democrats in 2010 was only to allow those who had been in the UK for ten years, spoke English and wished to work towards earning citizenship. There would also have been a probationary period and some form of voluntary service.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Barney, Katherine, ‘Mayor Wants Amnesty for Illegal Immigrants’, <em>London Evening Standard</em>, 9 March 2009, <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23659506-details/Mayor+wants+amnesty+for+illegal+immigrants/article.do" title="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23659506-details/Mayor+wants+amnesty+for+illegal+immigrants/article.do">http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23659506-details/Mayor+wa...</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Standford, Daniel, ‘Illegal immigration: Is an amnesty the answer’, BBC News, 19 April 2010, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/parties_and_issues/8629354.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/parties_and_issues/8629354.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/parties_and_issues/...</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

Instead of granting an amnesty governments need to get tougher on illegal immigrants in order to find, deport and deter them. This would be a much more popular policy and could be achieved using better monitoring and communications between departments.&nbsp; For example in the United States the Inland Revenue Service knows where millions of illegals live and are employed as they know 600,000 people work under the Social Security number 000-00-0000, presumably many more were used different made up numbers.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This would therefore not only catch illegal immigrants but would help end misuse of Social Security and IRS identification numbers. There are also other tactics that can make illegal immigration more difficult and less likely to pay such as preventing illegal immigrants from obtaining drivers licences or, as in Tennessee, employers that knowingly employ illegal immigrants can have their business licence suspended.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Standford, Daniel, ‘Illegal immigration: Is an amnesty the answer’, BBC News, 19 April 2010, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/parties_and_issues/8629354.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/parties_and_issues/8629354.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/parties_and_issues/...</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Sensenbrenner, James F., et al., ‘Social Security Better Coordination among Federal Agencies Could Reduce Unidentified Earnings Reports’, <em>United States Government Accountability Office</em>, February 2005, p.3. <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05154.pdf" title="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05154.pdf">http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05154.pdf</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Department of Labor and Workforce Development, ‘Illegal Alien Employment Act Frequently Asked Questions’, <em>Tn.gov</em>, <a href="http://www.tn.gov/labor-wfd/faq_illegal_alien.htm" title="http://www.tn.gov/labor-wfd/faq_illegal_alien.htm">http://www.tn.gov/labor-wfd/faq_illegal_alien.htm</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Amnesties do not increase immigration. For examples it is not the case that the Immigration Reform and Control Act encouraged immigration. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas concluded “it appears that amnesty programs do not encourage illegal immigration. If anything, IRCA reduced the number of illegal immigrants in the short run, perhaps because potential migrants thought that it would be more difficult to cross the border or to get a job in the United States after the law was passed.” And also over the long term illegal immigration did not increase. “apprehensions [at the Mexico-US border] were about 11 percent lower during the pre-filing period than prior to IRCA’s passage, controlling for other factors.” While there was little change overall between the periods before and after the amnesty.<a href="/print/18114#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18114#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Orrenius, Pia M., and Zavodny, Madeline, ‘Do Amnesty Programs Encourage Illegal Immigration?
