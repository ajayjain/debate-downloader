    <h1 class="print-title">This House doesn’t trust Republicans with the economy</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The Republican Party has traditionally been thought of as the party of the economy, leaving more ‘social’ goals to the Democrats in the public’s mind. It is interesting to consider whether this remains the case in the post-Bush era. Equally, it is interesting to consider where the Republican economic message would come from at a time when their old mantra of ‘deregulate or die’ has been tarnished by the banking crisis.</p><p>When President Bush took over from President Clinton he received, by way of legacy, the longest continuous period of growth in US history and a budget surplus of $4,000 billion – so large that it was anticipated that the US debt could be paid off by 2020 and the main source of political argument revolved around what to do with the money; cut taxes or improve services. Unemployment stood at 4%, a forty year low, following the creation of 15m jobs. The US economy represented one quarter of the entire output of the world<a href="/print/17757#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>.</p><p>During the Bush era “the median household income declined, poverty increased, childhood poverty increased even more, and the number of Americans without health insurance spiked. By contrast, the country's condition improved on each of those measures during Bill Clinton's two terms, often substantially.”<a href="/print/17757#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> It is however, worth noting that the worst global economic crash in living memory happened at the tail end of Bush’s tenure.</p><p>Republicans in the 2008 Presidential campaign pointed to what they saw as the benefits of the Bush presidency, insisting that they had produced, “More than 6.6 million new jobs have been created since August 2003. Our 4.1 annual growth rate [sic] is superior to all other major industrialized nations. The Dow has set record highs multiple times in the past several weeks. Productivity is up, and the deficit is down. Real, after-tax income has grown by 15 per cent since 2001. Inflation has remained low.”<a href="/print/17757#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a></p><p>Whichever version of events you choose, as far as the perception of many voters is concerned the Republicans are the party to turn to in tough economic times.<a href="/print/17757#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a> The party contends that free markets and low taxes deliver economic growth and that Democrats are ideologically unwilling to deliver either. They further insist that the Democratic Party’s tendency to impose regulation in areas such as environmental protection and workers’ rights has red tape strangling business. They contend that, “Democrats believe the economy is too complicated to be left to free enterprise alone, and therefore must be subjected to ever-increasing controls by the federal government.”<a href="/print/17757#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17757#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1110165.stm">Steve Schifferes. “Bill Clinton’s Economic Legacy.

                    <p>The Clinton legacy was one of extraordinary economic health including an enormous $4,000 billion surplus. This could have been used to improve services and create jobs.

                    <p>During the past 60 years Democrats have been considerably more likely to preside over a balanced budget than their Republican rivals. Since the OPEC shocks of the mid-70s the average unemployment rate under Republican Presidents has been 6.7 % as opposed to 5.5% under democrats.

                    <p>It is really not up to the Government to decide when a job is “good enough”, frankly when the alternative is welfare any job looks fairly attractive. It is also much easier to find new work when you are already in the job market. As well as providing an income, jobs also give the worker pride and self-respect.</p><p>It is in the interests of employers to pay as much as the market can bear – this way they get the best person for the job, however, it is not the role of government to tell them how much they should be paying as this removes the incentive to work hard.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is clear that the economic meltdown was, in large part, caused by deregulation of the banking and financial sectors.

                    <p>George Bush announced that cutting government was one of his greatest priorities, his actions could not have been further from this ambition. As with most Republican presidents, government spending grew considerably on his watch. Indeed no president since FDR presided over a larger rate of growth in the federal budget. The largest recipient has been the military with over $5tn dollars spent on defence during his two terms. To take one example, when the Transportation Security Administration took a guess at the cost of a national computer&nbsp; system in 2002, it pegged the price at $1bn.

When government gets too involved in the running of commerce – whether through taxation, regulation or the state ownership of companies, history has shown us that they start controlling other aspects of citizens lives in an effort to get the economic outcomes that they want.

                    <p>The Obama administration received one of the worst political legacies in US history. A broken economy, half a trillion dollars’ worth of debt, two expensive wars, a sick healthcare system and much more besides. In just three short years he has stopped the country haemorrhaging Money in Iraq and Afghanistan, introduced a healthcare system based on medical need rather than the ability to pay and has made progress in improving the economy. Although things are still difficult for many Americans and there are not enough jobs, the idea that having the Republicans back in the Whitehouse is clearly untrue. They were in large part responsible for creating the economic mess in the first place with reckless over-spending and unjustified tax hikes. They turned one of the best economic inheritances in history on its head, leaving the country broke, in debt and with nowhere to go.</p>        </div>
