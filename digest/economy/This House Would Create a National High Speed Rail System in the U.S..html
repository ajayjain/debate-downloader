    <h1 class="print-title">This House Would Create a National High Speed Rail System in the U.S.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>High-speed rail (HSR) is a type of passenger rail transport that operates significantly faster than the normal speed of rail traffic. Specific definitions by the European Union include 200 km/h (124 mph) for upgraded track and 250 km/h (155 mph) or faster for new track.</p><p>In Japan, Shinkansen lines run at speeds of up to 300 km/h (186 mph), and in China, high-speed conventional rail lines operate at top speeds of 350 km/h (217 mph), and one Maglev Line in Shanghai reaches speeds of 431 km/h (268 mph). As high-speed rail has become increasingly common around the world, and as countries begin considering whether adopting the transportation technology is a good idea, the debate over its various pros and cons has been elevated to newspaper front pages around the world. In the US, for example, President Obama's calls to institute a national high-speed rail system has been met with a flurry of both die-hard support and vitriolic criticism. The issues include whether high-speed trains are superior to flight and high-way driving, whether a better value can be achieved through expanding existing road, airport, and standard rail infrastructure and capacity, and whether high-speed trains are economical and a public good or merely a service that will be used by the wealthy. These and issues are outlined below.</p><p>This motion would have to be place set in the United States to make any real sense since investment in high speed rail is already occurring to a significant extent in Europe. By comparison in the U.S. $8 billion was taken away from the high speed rail program in November by congress. Proposition should ideally seek to propose this motion through re-implementing the $8 billion plan that Obama initially proposed. This would mean the creation of high speed rail services in ten different rail corridors as follows:</p><ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Corridor" title="Southeast Corridor">Southeast Corridor</a>—Washington, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond" title="Richmond">Richmond</a>, Newport News, Norfolk, Raleigh, Charlotte, Atlanta, Columbia, Jacksonville</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Corridor" title="California Corridor">California Corridor</a>—Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose, Fresno, Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest_Corridor" title="Pacific Northwest Corridor">Pacific Northwest Corridor</a>—Eugene, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Central_Corridor" title="South Central Corridor">South Central Corridor</a>—Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Texarkana, and Little Rock</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_Corridor" title="Gulf Coast Corridor">Gulf Coast Corridor</a>—Houston, New Orleans, Mobile</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Hub_Network" title="Chicago Hub Network">Chicago Hub Network</a>—Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit, Cleveland, Toledo, Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, Kansas City, St. Louis, Louisville, Milwaukee, Minneapolis/St. Paul</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Corridor" title="Florida Corridor">Florida Corridor</a>—Tampa, Orlando, Miami</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Corridor" title="Keystone Corridor">Keystone Corridor</a>—Pittsburgh, Philadelphia</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Corridor" title="Empire Corridor">Empire Corridor</a>—Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Schenectady and Albany</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_New_England_Corridor" title="Northern New England Corridor">Northern New England Corridor</a>—Boston, Portland/Auburn, Montreal, Springfield, New Haven<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail_in_the_United_States#cite_note-22"><sup>[23]</sup></a></li></ul><p>Whilst proposition does not have to go into so much detail regarding the lines, an example or two would be useful. Generally the debate can simply be framed with the idea that links between major American cities would be created by high speed rail.</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

                    <p>Currently intercity travel within the U.S. tends to favour air travel. This is often due to the large distances between cities within the U.S. which mean that driving is not a viable strategy should there be time constraints on travel. However, air travel has significant constraints as well such as long boarding times. This causes problems for those people who frequently commute and high speed rail is set to solve these problems.</p><p>High speed rail provides a large number of significant benefits over air travel in this regard. This is because high speed rail can travel to city centres. Where airports, due to their size and the noise pollution they cause, are limited to the outskirts of a city, trains are not limited in the same way. As such, people can arrive in a much more central area, cutting large amounts of time off their journey.</p><p>Secondly, high speed rail has no limits on wireless communication or internet in the same way that air travel does. As such, high speed rail is significantly more useful for anyone who wishes to work on the journey.</p><p>Finally, the weather is incredibly problematic for air travel. This is especially true in the U.S. where a number of areas can be subject to unexpected snow or storms. By comparison, High Speed rail remains comparatively unhindered.<a href="/print/17849#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> “Convenience of High Speed Rail.” US High Speed Rail Association. http://www.ushsr.com/benefits/convenience.html</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>High Speed rail is unlikely to work in the same way as air travel. Whilst some areas are more convenient, it remains a slower method of transport than air travel and with quoted prices for high speed rail it seems evident that the majority of consumers will simply continue to opt for air travel as it is a significantly faster method of travel to their destination. As such high speed rail will not provide significant extra benefits to consumers.<a href="/print/17849#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Further, if the problem with air travel is the location out airports outside of city centres, then that problem is easily solved through the creation of better transportation methods between airports and city centres. With the time saved, a plane ticket that also encompassed a ride to the city centre would still be faster and would probably end up being significantly cheaper than a ticket on high speed rail.</p><div><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Mobley, Jack. “A Case Against High-Speed Rail.” Merced Sun Star. 11/12/2010 http://www.mercedsunstar.com/2010/12/11/1688825/jack-mobley-a-case-against-high.html</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Improvements to existing rail networks would ultimately fail to be viable as a replacement for highspeed rail. As British Transport Secretary (now reshuffled) Phillip Hammond states, "Opponents of the project have asked why we cannot simply upgrade our existing infrastructure to deal with this capacity challenge. But no upgrade of existing infrastructure can deliver the huge improvements in journey times and the transformation of our economic geography that a new high speed network would bring. Reliability would also deteriorate as we tried to squeeze ever more capacity out of existing, mixed-use lines. And another major upgrade to the West Coast Main Line would deliver years of disruption and huge economic cost."<a href="/print/17849#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Upgrading infrastructure may be an answer in some places, but not in all. There may not be the existing infrastructure to upgrade. The United States for example just does not have lines that could take both large numbers of passengers and the large amount of freight they already take. Moreover any upgrade of these existing lines would end up with a rail system which is uncompetitive with road and air transport, exactly why rail passenger transport ended in the 1930-50s in the United States despite having been running faster than Amtrak trains do today.<a href="/print/17849#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>Further, railroad tracks permit a far higher throughput of passengers per hour than a road the same width. A high speed rail needs just a double track railway, with one track for each direction. For the Eurostar the typical capacity is 15 trains per hour and 800 passengers per train (as for the Eurostar sets), which implies a capacity of 12,000 passengers per hour in each direction. By contrast, the Highway Capacity Manual gives a maximum capacity for a single lane of highway of 2,250 passenger cars per hour (excluding trucks or RVs).<a href="/print/17849#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Assuming an average vehicle occupancy of 1.57 people,<a href="/print/17849#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> a standard twin track railway has a typical capacity 13% greater than a 6-lane highway (3 lanes each way), while requiring only 40% of the land (1.0/3.0 versus 2.5/7.5 hectares per kilometer of direct/indirect land consumption). This means that typical passenger rail carries 2.83 times as many passengers per hour per meter (width) as a road.<a href="/print/17849#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Hammond, Phillip. “High Speed Rail: the case for.” The Telegraph. 26/11/2010 <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/8160811/High-Speed-Rail-the-case-for.html" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/8160811/High-Speed-Rail-the-case-for.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/8160811/H...</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> “Ask Trains from November 2008”, Trains, November 2008, <a href="http://trn.trains.com/en/sitecore/content/Home/Railroad%20Reference/Ask%20Trains/2008/12/Ask%20Trains%20from%20November%202008.aspx" title="http://trn.trains.com/en/sitecore/content/Home/Railroad%20Reference/Ask%20Trains/2008/12/Ask%20Trains%20from%20November%202008.aspx">http://trn.trains.com/en/sitecore/content/Home/Railroad%20Reference/Ask%...</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Elefteriadou, Lily, “Chapter 8 Highway Capacity”, Handbook of Transport Engineering, 2004, <a href="http://www.accessengineeringlibrary.com/mghpdf/0071450246_ar008.pdf" title="http://www.accessengineeringlibrary.com/mghpdf/0071450246_ar008.pdf">http://www.accessengineeringlibrary.com/mghpdf/0071450246_ar008.pdf</a></p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> U.S. Department of Energy, “Vehicle Occupancy by Type of Vehicle”, Fact #257: March 3, 2003, <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2003/fcvt_fotw257.html" title="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2003/fcvt_fotw257.html">http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2003/fcvt_fotw257.html</a></p></div><div id="ftn5"><p><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> High Speed Rail, Railsystem.net</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The need for increased capacity on travelled lines can be addressed in a number of ways. Firstly, highways still can be expanded. Highways are much more versatile than rail services as they enable people to get from a single destination to another without any transfers. Given then that highways can be improved, it makes very little sense to not do so and improve the rail system later when this extra capacity created begins to fill up.<a href="/print/17849#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Given that cities have different requirements of transport, it makes more sense to allow transport planning to remain decentralised. For example, California is creating a high speed transport system on its state budget because it has need, assuming that other cities do when their governing structures have not determined that is the case is irresponsible and unneeded.<a href="/print/17849#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Mobley, Jack. “A Case Against High-Speed Rail.” Merced Sun Star. 11/12/2010 <a href="http://www.mercedsunstar.com/2010/12/11/1688825/jack-mobley-a-case-against-high.html" title="http://www.mercedsunstar.com/2010/12/11/1688825/jack-mobley-a-case-against-high.html">http://www.mercedsunstar.com/2010/12/11/1688825/jack-mobley-a-case-again...</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> “On the wrong track: Why high-speed trains are not such a green alternative.” The Guardian. 29/04/2010 <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/29/high-speed-rail-travel-europe-uk" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/29/high-speed-rail-travel-europe-uk">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/29/high-speed-rail-travel...</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Trains are the most sustainable and green form of transportation. Electric high speed rail is the most energy efficient of all trains. This is because trains have significantly high capacity but have very low power requirements in order to work by comparison to the number of passengers that they carry. Although this is to some extent dependant on how the power is generated the Eurostar (where power comes from French nuclear plants) emits only 11g GO2 per passenger kilometre from London to Paris compared to 180g for a car containing 1.2 passengers and 150g for a short haul flight.<a href="/print/17849#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>A national high speed rail system would be the centrepiece of a sustainable America, and would significantly reduce congestion and America’s dependence on cars and the oil that fuels them.

                    <p>Owing to the extremely high speeds of high speed rail, should there be a problem with the trains the chance of a catastrophic accident is greatly increased. This is because there would be no reaction time for the driver. Further, should there be a derailment the impact of the crash will be significant greater owing to the speed of the train.</p><p>Should these accidents occur, the damage to the trains will obviously be catastrophic, but also the damage to the lines themselves will be incredibly significant.

Yes, if a crash occurs it is likely to be significantly more dangerous than a crash at lower speeds, but this is also the case with cars travelling between cities on highways and even more so with aeroplanes.

                    <p>Within an economic climate that is in recession, the best way to avoid recession is to increase public spending. This is because the extra jobs created through public spending stimulate the economy. This is because the spending results in the employment of a number of people who otherwise would have remained unemployed and on a lower wage. As such, these people are more able to consume and more able to spend their money on consumer goods.</p><p>In this way, the economy is pushed out of recession as this initial wave of spending means that the people who sold the products to the consumers now have more money themselves to spend elsewhere.</p><p>Whilst this is fairly basic Keynesian analysis of the markets, the reason that the spending here is not susceptible to causing inflation and hence negating the effect is that markets take time to adjust to stimuli. The inflation rate will only increase appropriately once the market has reacted to the stimulus. As such, the initial year or two following a stimulus results in a temporary boost to the economy and then results in inflation later. Given that the recession is likely to be over in two years, dealing with inflation in the future is something that the economy can handle in response for a stimulus that might push it out of recession.<a href="/print/17849#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> “Keynesian Economics.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The issue with high speed rail is that it is a case of a government providing what is essentially a private good. The market that will use high speed rail will be people who wish to commute between cities quickly, generally rich businesspeople. As such, the market for such a product is incredibly niche. Further, the price of high speed rail will still be higher than plane and the journey times between most cities that aren’t very close together already will still be longer. As such, it seems that there is an incredibly small market for such a product. The reason a market for this product does not exist already is that no private company could ever make a profit from the product owing to the low demand among consumers for it.<a href="/print/17849#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Therefore, the only way to make the product work would be to ensure that the product is significantly cheaper than the competition. Unfortunately the only way to do this would be through large subsidies for train use, meaning that high speed rail would continue to make a net loss for the U.S. government for years to come.</p><p>Further, any benefit in terms of jobs created for people in local communities will be incredibly low, for example with automatic barriers very few staff are needed at stations. Instead for the same amount of money, the government could easily implement policies which placed solar panels in every home, allowing them to generate and export their own power. Whilst this wouldn’t create jobs, it would increase income for people in the area and would likely help the environment to a significantly greater extent.<a href="/print/17849#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Staley, Samuel. “The Pragmatic Case Against High-Speed Rail.” Reason Foundation. 22/06/2009 <a href="http://reason.org/blog/show/the-pragmatic-case-against-hig" title="http://reason.org/blog/show/the-pragmatic-case-against-hig">http://reason.org/blog/show/the-pragmatic-case-against-hig</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> “High-Speed Rail and the Case Against Private Infrastructure.” The Atlantic. 16/07/2010 <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/09/high-speed-rail-and-the-case-against-private-infrastructure/63097/" title="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/09/high-speed-rail-and-the-case-against-private-infrastructure/63097/">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/09/high-speed-rail-and-...</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The US High Speed Train Association has found a significant number of benefits for high speed rail that mean that it would be beneficial regardless of its success as a business.</p><p>Firstly, high speed rail would foster transport oriented development:</p><p>"Transit oriented development (TOD) is the exciting new fast growing trend in creating vibrant, compact, liveable, walkable communities centered around high quality train systems. TODs can be stand-alone communities, or a series of towns strung along a rail line like pearls on a string. TODs are the integration of community design with rail system planning. High speed rail is the backbone of a rail-based transportation system. When combined with regional rail, light rail, metro systems, streetcars and trams, a complete and integrated rail network is achieved enabling easy, fast mobility throughout the system. Coordinating and encouraging compact, mixed-use development around the rail stations completes the system by enabling people to live, work, and play along the system without the need for a car much of the time. Together, these save time, money, energy, and lives."</p><p>And further, high speed rail would also help businesspeople be more productive:</p><p>"High speed rail delivers fast, efficient transportation so riders can spend less time traveling and more time doing business. High speed rail delivers people quickly to their destinations in city centers. Fast boarding times, no security delays, and no waiting for baggage (or lost bags) adds up to much less time spent getting to and from meetings. Adding to these savings, there's also little or no down time - people can be far more productive and efficient during a trip on a train, than flying or driving, and return to the office sooner with a shorter turn-around time. High speed rail allows people to continue working the entire trip using laptops and cell phones. Flexible meeting space is available on the train. Because of the reliability of trains and the reduced total trip time, an overnight stay is not always required - saving additional time and money. High speed rail offers great flexibility to plan last minute trips, purchase tickets on short notice, and make changes to schedules without huge penalties."<a href="/print/17849#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>And further to all of this high speed rail also frees up existing rail lines for other purposes, such as freight services as well as for commuter services, helping people in the economy to a significant extent. Given that this is true, it seems prudent to subsidise high speed rail even if it is costly as a business. Further, the motor industry already sees incredible subsidies in the U.S. and does not provide nearly as much social benefit as high speed rail is likely to.</p><div><a href="/print/17849#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> “Productivity Gains with High Speed Rail.” US High Speed Rail Association. http://www.ushsr.com/benefits/productivity.html</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
