    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes that Europe should weaken its austerity measures to guarantee its citizens greater social support. </h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>On Saturday 5<sup>th</sup> May the French and Greeks went to the polls and both countries voted against austerity. In France President Sarkozy became the 11<sup>th</sup> European leader to loose office largely as a result of the European financial crisis being replaced by Francois Hollande, a socialist, who campaigned on a promise of growth and less austerity.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>The European economy is in crisis, the economies of many member states have been flat lining or even declining since the financial crisis of 2008. The smaller countries around Europe&rsquo;s periphery in particular have faced steep declines in their economies. Ireland&rsquo;s economy declined by 6.7% between 2008 and 2011<a href="/print/21757#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> while Greece&rsquo;s has fallen by 16%.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> What started as a financial crisis or a housing bubble has become a debt crisis as governments tried to spend their way out of recession they built up large debts, so large in the case of some countries that they have had to have bail outs. Other European countries only agreed to provide money for these bail outs on the condition of the countries being rescued impose austerity to reduce their expenditures to provide confidence that they will be able to pay back their debts. On 2<sup>nd</sup> March 2012 European leaders with the exception of the UK and Czech Republic signed the Fiscal Compact which committed its signatories to a structural deficit (meaning it allows for deficits for investments like infrastructure that will pay off in the future) not exceeding 0.5% of GDP and to reducing government debt down to 60% of GDP.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Austerity however is not popular and the results of the recent elections are threatening this treaty and its ambitious goals. This debate discusses whether Europe needs to stick to stringent austerity measures such as those that will be needed to meet the compact or should states put the social support of their citizens first.</p>
<p>Some terms used in this debate</p>
<p>Austerity: during the recent crisis has come to mean an economic policy of cutting the deficit and debt through cutting spending. This often inevitably means reducing benefits.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p>
<p>Demand: The amount people are willing to buy of goods and services at a given price.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> In the whole economy this means the combined amount of goods and services the whole population wants to buy.</p>
<p>Social support: In this debate we are taking this to mean support provided by the state to society and individuals.Welfare state: The responsibility of the state for the social and economic wellbeing of its citizens usually in the case of health care, education, employment and social security.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></p>

                    <p>We all have a duty to provide aid to those who need it and the government is the best placed to act on this duty. We all need a place to live, a level of healthcare and some income in order to survive. The idea behind the welfare state is to provide for this through creating a safety net for every citizen. The state is responsible for the social and economic wellbeing of it citizens.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It does this by, for example, provision of social housing &ndash; either at greatly reduced rates or free of charge, through state hospitals, through unemployment benefit for those made unemployed and disability benefits for those who can&rsquo;t work. With austerity the government is doing exactly the opposite of what it should be doing to help its citizens. Just at a time when more people need these payments they are being cut back. To make matters worse an increase in VAT has been a favored method of increasing government income while there has been a squeeze on unemployment benefits as the government does not want to pay more as unemployment rises; in Greece in the year to December 2010 the number of unemployed workers was up 45.1% whereas the number of unemployment benefit recipients went up only 9.6%. As a result the whole package of austerity measures is usually regressive, with its impact falling harder on the poor than the rich, as has been the case in Greece.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>Austerity leads to a cycle of decline that continues on down until the state has been stripped down to the bare bones. We are seeing this in countries where the European Union has enforced austerity as a condition for bailouts, particularly Greece. Government austerity reduces demand as the government is spending less. With less demand the economy is damaged and a smaller tax take comes in for the government leading to even greater austerity if the government is to balance its books. Austerity therefore creates a vicious cycle when there is no extra demand from the private sector to cushion the blow.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Even Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s previously a champion of austerity in its justification for downgrading the credit rating of Eurozone governments said &ldquo;austerity alone risks becoming &nbsp;self-defeating, as domestic demand falls in line with consumers&#39; rising concerns about job security and disposable incomes, eroding national tax revenues.&rdquo;<a href="/print/21757#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>The answer is therefore less austerity, more support for the economy and more social support for the citizens. If people are less concerned for the future as a result of knowing there will be government support if they are made unemployed they will be more willing to spend rather than save when they are employed so helping the economy to recover.</p>

                    <p>Arguing that austerity will lead to a cycle of decline due to less demand ignores the role of the markets and their concerns with the state&rsquo;s debt burden. The UK has only managed to hold on to its triple A credit rating (the best possible rating that can be given to a borrower&rsquo;s debts, meaning lower interest rates)<a href="/print/21757#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> due to austerity.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> European countries that have not convinced the markets that they take the debt threat seriously such as France have had their ratings hit and have had to pay more to finance their government debt.</p>
<p>Spending more on something as economically inefficient as social support would be a bad way to stimulate the economy as it will not be helping future growth. Moreover it is far from certain people really would spend more if they know there is a welfare net as most people will realise that if the government is to spend more they will also need more taxes at some point to pay for that spending. Why would consumers spend more now even if there is a bigger social security net if they think they will also have more money taken from them to pay for this net?<a href="/print/21757#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>

                    <p>Recessions are caused by too little demand in the economy so austerity in a time of recession is exactly the opposite of what the government should be doing as it means further reductions in the amount of demand in the economy. Governments should take an activist approach to try to stabilise the economic cycle (the swinging from boom to bust to boom that characterises the economy) or at least reduce the depths of the recessions and temper the booms. This means that Governments should spend less when the economy is booming and, crucially, more when the economy is in recession so as to stabilise the economy.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>It should be remembered that government spending does not just affect the public sector there is a multiplier effect on the economy, spending on building a road not only means construction companies get business but so do their suppliers and their workers spend their new wages in shops. Economists working for President Obama at the time of the U.S. stimulus believed that for every 1$ spent by the government there would be 1.6$ benefit to the economy.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>Many governments were not following Keynesian economics during the boom before 2008 and so cannot expect to be able to implement extra spending now. France for example last had a budget surplus almost forty years ago in 1974<a href="/print/21757#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> so has not built up the necessary surpluses to be able to use government spending to reduce the impact of recessions.</p>
<p>Moreover that government intervention is a good thing makes the assumption that the government knows what it is doing and will do better than the free market.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This is not usually the case. Instead government spending is regularly misdirected and not nearly as good a stimulus as it should be.</p>

                    <p>The current course of austerity on top of austerity risks creating a lost generation of youth across Europe. Unemployment is high everywhere in Europe but it is particularly pronounced among young people. In the Eurozone the average youth, under 25s, unemployment rate is 21.6% while in Spain and Greece it is more than 50%.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Such staggeringly high unemployment rates will have immense consequences as a whole generation is demoralised. Even when the economy recovers this lost generation may not be able to get a job as new school leavers and graduates will get the jobs in preference to those who have been unemployed for long periods.</p>
<p>There needs to be more money, not less, for education and retraining for the sectors of the economy where there are jobs, such as IT specialists. This means more investment not just in adult education but more money being spent on creating jobs, whether permanent, placements or internships, specifically to give young people experience in work. The European commission recognises the problem and is providing &euro;275 million for placements around Europe, member governments must do the same.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>This will not happen. When the economy recovers so youth unemployment will go down as well. The young who have not been able to get a job will be no more unemployable than those who are just starting out. They may be lacking experience but having not had a job for several years they will be determined to work hard and do as well as possible.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Welfare is necessary, but only for the really needy. There does need to be a social security safety net but it is often too generous, as is the case in many western European countries today. If welfare is too generous then there is a disincentive to work or even to be looking for work as those claiming benefits can live as well on benefits as they could if they got a low paid job. These people who are idle and living off benefits cost every hard working taxpayer who is paying for their idleness.</p>
<p>Europe is an immense economy and not all of it is affected as badly by the recession; in Germany the unemployment rate for under 25&rsquo;s is only 8.2%<a href="/print/21757#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> those out of work should move to where there are jobs. Benefits therefore need to be cut in order to encourage the unemployed to be more adventurous in searching for work.</p>

                    <p>Welfare and social support can only continue as long as there is money to pay it. Only at great risk can European countries continue their current generous rates of social support as these systems are going bankrupt. It is workers taxes that pay for the state&rsquo;s expenditure on healthcare, education and benefits. Also almost everywhere current taxes pay for state pensions rather than the pensions having been already paid for by workers contributions throughout their working life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is a squeeze on all social support mechanisms due to Europe&rsquo;s aging population. The dependency ratio, the number of workers compared to those receiving pensions, in Germany will grow from 24% in 2000 to 61% in 2050 meaning rather than there being four workers paying for every pension there will be less than two.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> As a result pensions and health care costs will rise dramatically. These are costs that the state will have to manage on a declining tax base due to having fewer workers. Today&rsquo;s young, the &lsquo;lost generation&rsquo; are going to be hit with having to pay for these changes. We need to start reducing these expenditures now.</p>

                    <p>Those who argue that more government spending can get European countries out of recession are plain wrong. This is because we are now living in a globalised world where ultimately the only way to growth is to be competitive in the global market place. The state sector has never been competitive as was shown by the collapse of the USSR and other communist countries whose state planning could not keep up either with demand or with their free market rivals.</p>
<p>European countries no longer have a competitive edge in even high tech products and so European companies need to pay rates that are competitive against China, India and Turkey even in sectors such as IT, design and marketing. China for example now has more than half a million engineering graduates a year and over 10,000 Ph.D engineering graduates, in both cases considerably more than the United States.<a href="/print/21757#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> If these graduates are willing to accept lower wages than their European competitors then Europe will lose business and jobs reducing wage rates. If wages are declining then unemployment benefits have to be made less generous to prevent people staying on benefits rather than finding work and pensions will need to be capped as the employed won&rsquo;t be able to pay enough to pay for yesterday&rsquo;s workers.</p>

                    <p>It is hyperbole to think that more government spending over the short term can be compared to the state planning of the soviet union. Instead the parallel should be drawn to those countries who have grown precisely because the state helped guide the market; the growth of Japan from the 1950&rsquo;s guided by MITI or of Chinese &lsquo;state capitalism&rsquo; today.</p>
<p>Europe is only becoming relatively rather than absolutely less competitive. Yes, there are thousands of new graduates in India and China but there is also an expanding pie, globalization is not a zero sum game, there is room for developing countries to catch up while European nations continue getting richer, albeit at a slower rate. &nbsp;This is because new technology will make workers more productive and increase living standards for everyone.</p>
