    <div class="print-content"><p>In 1930, there were between five and ten million wild African elephants; by 1990, when they were added to the list of critically endangered species, only about 600,000 remained<sup>1</sup>. As part of the effort to combat this threat, in 1986, ivory trading was banned by the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). By the mid-1990s, the population of African elephants was rising by an average of 4.5% a year, however by 2009 the trend had again been reversed and the population stood at around 500,000. Asian elephants have fared just as badly, there numbers have dropped from 200,000 a century ago to around 40,000 today<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>During the &#39;90s, when elephant populations were increasing, CITES allowed Botswana, Zimbabwe and Namibia to sell ivory stockpiled by their governments&#39; environmental agencies to Japan, the centre of international demand for ivory, as a one-off measure. In 2000 South Africa and other southern African states argued unsuccessfully at the CITES convention in Nairobi for the ban on ivory sales to be more generally relaxed. In 2008, CITE temporarily lifted the ban on the sale of existing stockpiles of ivory, generating much-needed income for African states<sup>2</sup>.</p>

                    <p>Poaching has been effectively eliminated in parts of Southern Africa through efficient game park management and the development of game tourism, which gives local peoples an incentive to protect wildlife as a long-term economic resource. In Kenya, tourism is the third largest contributor to their economy, and 70% of this is derived from wildlife, but it is still not enough<sup>1</sup>. The Director of the association in Kenya charged with elephant protection, the Lusaka Agreement Taskforce, has admitted mobilizing adequate resources to combat the illegal wildlife trade is a challenge<sup>2</sup>. For this approach to be sustained the parks must generate greater income; realistically, this can only be done through the sale of stockpiled ivory. Why should they not be able to profit from stockpiled ivory confiscated from poachers or dead elephants?</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/amid-legal-ivory-trade-illegal-sales-grow/"> Browne, P.

                    <p>Permitting the sale of stockpiled ivory only provides an incentive to clamp down on poachers once they have completed their poaching. As a result, little weight is given to the welfare of the elephant. States hoping to profit from the sales of stockpiles are in essence being encouraged to work in cohorts with poachers; poachers get the ivory, they then get 'caught' by the state who give them a cut of subsequent sales of the 'confiscated' ivory. An entire black market could evolve whereby both the state and poachers profit, with the elephant population the only loser.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Elephants are highly intelligent animals, clearly sentient in ways which are continually being revealed by research. As such, it is unethical to use them for the harvest of ivory, legitimising the view that they can be exploited in any way convenient to humankind. It is only recently that scientists have demonstrated the sentience of elephants; they pass the mirror and self-recognition tests<sup>1</sup>, however specific incidents have shown their unhappiness at the gradual erosion of their habitat and population. A group of wild elephants recently went on the rampage in Mysore in India, killing one and injuring others<sup>2</sup>. If we are willing to protect our own domesticated, intelligent animals like dogs and cats, there is no reason not to extend such protections to wild, intelligent animals like the elephant. The Hindus treat the elephant as one of the pillars that upheld the world; the world should take note<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/green_green_living/out_and_about/994574/among_necessary_giants_why_we_cant_afford_to_lose_the_elephant.html"> Christo, C., &amp; Wilkinson, M.

                    <p>Defining sentience is impossible, making it impossible to determine which animals deserve rights or protection: Sentience refers to an animal's ability to utilize their sensory organs in such a way that they can "feel" or "perceive subjectively". This is impossible to define accurately. How can there be a specific threshold that, once crossed, the animal snaps into a state of "sentience". This difficulty makes any law based on "sentience" untenable.</p><p>Even if we could define sentience, how human-like would an animal need to be to warrant protection: The problem with protecting animals on the basis of their sentience or their human-likeness is that it is nearly impossible to define a threshold for legal purposes. How sentient or human-like would an animal need to be before it would warrant our offering of rights or protections? Creating a threshold would be incredibly difficult, and risk being arbitrary, and thus it would be unfit for being made into law.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Ivory is expensive to store, and degrades over time. It costs Zimbabwe $13 million annually to secure its stockpile<sup>1</sup>. The Wildlife Authority in the country is now keen for the moratorium on the international sale of ivory to end in 2016 so that they can benefit from the stockpiling and recoup the costs of storage<sup>1</sup>. Zimbabwe is also believed to be close to the limit of its storage space<sup>1</sup>. It is therefore sensible to allow its sale in order to recoup these expenses and to do so on a permanent, controlled basis, rather than through one-off schemes such as the 1999 sale to Japan.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.tradeafricablog.com/2011/02/zimbabwe-ivory-stockpile-grows-amid.html"> Mushawevato, P.

                    <p>Storage costs and depreciation are only problems if ivory is stored in the hope of eventual sale. Kenya's game conservancy burns the ivory it obtains from culls or confiscates from poachers, avoiding both of these problems and showing its commitment to ending all possibility of renewed trade<sup>1</sup>. If Zimbabwe is truly committed to the long-term viability of its elephant population, it would do similarly and burn its large, existing stockpile. Kenya has also advanced plans to send all confiscated ivory to a museum where the items can be displayed and income generated in a sustainable fashion<sup>2</sup>. Both solutions remove the costs incurred in stockpiling confiscated ivory.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2011/07/laws-fail-to-deter-poachers/"> Karongo, C.

                    <p>Lifting the trading ban would renew interest in ivory artefacts and increase the size of the market for them, raising their price. This will ensure there is always a long-term threat to elephants from man, and discourage conservation efforts when profits can be made from the trade in ivory. When CITES permitted one-off sales in Africa in 2008, there was a 'global surge' in the level of seizures of illegal ivory as demand was driven by the belief that the restrictions on ivory were no longer as strict<sup>1</sup>. The price of ivory was also driven to record levels as a result of renewed interest in the good<sup>1</sup>. All this evidence suggests that the lifting of the ban, even merely stockpiled ivory as per the proposition model, would precipitate a instantaneous global market for the good.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anna-brones/un-ban-on-ivory-threatene_b_497111.html"> Brones, A.

                    <p>The demand for ivory would be irrelevant if the model proposed was accepted. The fact ivory is selling as highly as it is currently suggests that restrictions and anti-poaching efforts have been incredibly successful. So long as these methods continue, demand should not affect supply. Allowing the sale of stockpiled ivory would therefore suit all parties – the markets for ivory would receive some of what they desire, the trading parties would receive a funding boost and elephant populations would still retain the protections that have ensured the price for ivory is still high, suggesting supply is low.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Lifting the ban on ivory trading, even temporarily and only for stockpiled ivory, would encourage poachers to expand their activities. As only expensive DNA tests can reveal where worked ivory originated and which species it was from, lifting the trading ban would make it easy for poachers everywhere to smuggle ivory across borders and sell it, increasing their profits and their motivation to kill more elephants. The corruption widespread in Africa and parts of Asia would make it easy for poachers to mask the illegal origins of their ivory, passing it off as legitimate. When the trading ban was lifted for a number of African countries in 2008, the number of elephants illegally poached rose by 100%. As James Isiche stated, 'the correlation between this rise in elephant poaching and the one-off sale of stockpiles by CITES can no longer be ignored'<sup>1</sup>. If elephants are to be protected from poachers, the ivory trade cannot be permitted in any form, anywhere.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anna-brones/un-ban-on-ivory-threatene_b_497111.html"> Brones, A.

                    <p>Poaching has been effectively eliminated in southern Africa through efficient game park management and the development of game tourism, which gives local peoples an incentive to protect wildlife as a long-term economic resource. For this approach to be sustained the parks must generate greater income from their elephant populations; realistically, this can only be done through the sale of stockpiled ivory. If other countries have a problem with poaching, they should follow the example of e.g. South Africa and Botswana, rather than seeking to harm the successful conservancy programmes in those states.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Conservation efforts have already proven themselves very successful, and the model suggested by the proposition will not affect these efforts. Proceeds from the sales of stockpiled ivory could in fact be channelled into further conservation efforts that would ensure both elephant populations could grow whilst limited ivory sales funded their protection. It is the loss of habitat and incessant warfare that are the most worrying trends for elephant populations, particularly in Africa, and the ivory trade has little effect on those.

                    <p>The elephant populations of southern African states are growing rapidly, placing a strain upon the resources of the national parks in which they live. This has necessitated culls with the result that government environment agencies have built up large stockpiles of ivory (also acquired from animals that died naturally), which they are currently unable to sell. Relaxing the CITES ban on trading ivory, subject to careful regulation, would bring much needed cash to the environmental programmes of these impoverished countries, helping them to safeguard the long-term survival of African elephants. The relaxation of the CITES ban in the late '90s was worth $5 million for Bostwana, Namibia and Zimbabwe; as regular income, such a figure would be invaluable for a struggling Central African economy.</p>        </div>
