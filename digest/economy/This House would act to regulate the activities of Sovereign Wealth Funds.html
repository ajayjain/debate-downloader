    <h1 class="print-title">This House would act to regulate the activities of Sovereign Wealth Funds</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are investment vehicles owned by governments that wish to invest some of their country’s reserves of money abroad. In the past they tended to be owned by countries rich in natural resources, particularly oil, such as Norway and Kuwait. These states were keen to invest some of their high resource revenues in the good times, as a hedge against low points in the commodities cycle and the time when their natural wealth becomes exhausted. Investing such large sums of money at home was likely to lead to wasteful spending and inflation, as well as concentrating risk, so they sought opportunities abroad in bonds and share markets.</p><p>About two-thirds of the value of global SWFs is associated with oil wealth, but other emerging economies have also established state-owned companies to invest some of their reserves overseas.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> As long ago as 1974 Singapore’s government established Temasek as a holding company for state-investments. This has been seen as an important contributor to national prosperity, both through the income it has generated from wise investments, and because of the way it has supported Singapore’s emergence as a developed economy with thriving high-tech and financial sectors. More recently Asian countries with current account surpluses have built up large government reserves of currency, and have set up sovereign wealth funds in order to generate higher returns on these holdings. It was estimated in 2007 that SWFs held $2500 billion in assets, with a projected increase to over £10000 billion by 2012.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>SWFs vary greatly in their investment strategies, with some like Norway’s stabilisation fund or Kuwait’s Investment Authority being content to act as passive investors holding small stakes in hundreds of companies as well as mutual funds, private equity groups and hedge funds. Others, such as Temasek or Dubai International Capital are more active, seeking to take substantial positions in foreign companies or even to buy them outright.</p><p>Concern has been raised over the rapid growth in SWF assets, and the impact they may have on international financial markets. More politically controversial in many countries is the motivation behind the more active SWFs’ strategies – are they seeking simply to maximise returns for their state owners, or could their purchases be part of a more sinister plan to exploit financial stakes abroad for political reasons? Attempts by state-owned companies from China and Dubai to buy major American companies ran up against political opposition in 2006-7 and were abandoned, although in 2008 flows of money from SWFs have been welcomed as part of efforts to shore up shaky banks.</p><p>As SWFs have become more prominent, many proposals have been put forward to restrain their activities, including voluntary codes promoted by the IMF and suggestions that they commit to becoming only passive investors. Others, including former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, have argued for stronger action, such as rules restricting their voting rights or to limit their investment in a company to a maximum level of, say 20%. This topic focuses upon the arguments for and against sovereign wealth funds in general, but does include reference to some of the most popular models of regulation.</p><div><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Teslik, Lee Hudson, ‘Backgrounder: Sovereign Wealth Funds’, 2009, p.6<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Johnson, Simon, ‘The Rise of Sovereign Wealth Funds’, 2007</p></div></div><p><br>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-editors">

                    <p>Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) have become very important players in the global economy. The already exceed the assets controlled by hedge funds and will surpass the stock of global foreign exchange reserves.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> They are now so big that their activities can shift markets, such as Norway’s Government Pension Fund did when short selling Iceland’s banks, leading to panic and instability when they sell assets suddenly.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Their purchases can mean that companies owned by other states can end up dominating the economies of smaller countries, undermining their own sovereignty and economic independence.

                    <p>Sovereign wealth funds are not new and they are still only a tiny part of the global financial system. They represent only about 2% of global traded securities, and are dwarfed by other financial actors such as mutual funds, or private equity groups and hedge funds.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> What is more, in comparison with these other players in the global financial system, SWFs are long-term investors looking many years, even decades into the future.

                    <p>Sovereign wealth funds raise worrying issues about national security. Unlike mutual funds or private equity groups, which seek only to maximise their investors’ returns, SWFs must be regarded as political entities. Rather than passively holding their assets, they may seek to use their purchases to gain access to natural resources, advanced technologies, including those crucial to our defence, or other strategic sectors.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> For example Gulf states are using their SWFs to invest in food and natural resources from Latin America.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> They may engage in economic nationalism, shutting factories in western countries to give an unfair advantage to their own industries<a href="/print/17857#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. While it has not yet happened they may even attempt economic blackmail, threatening to turn off the lights through their control of energy companies and utilities if governments do not fall in with their foreign policy aims. Allowing countries such as China, Russia and various Gulf states to buy up western companies at will is potentially very dangerous. Even if we regard these states as friendly at the moment, there is no guarantee that they will stay that way, especially as none of them share our political values.</p><div><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Lyons, Gerard, ‘State Capitalism: The rise of sovereign wealth funds’, 2007, p.14 <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/111407_Lyons.pdf" title="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/111407_Lyons.pdf">http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/111407_Lyons.pdf</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Pearson, Samantha, ‘Sovereign wealth funds: Foreign cash has its drawbacks’, 2011, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e5e4f274-6ef5-11e0-a13b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1bEemFdel" title="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e5e4f274-6ef5-11e0-a13b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1bEemFdel">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e5e4f274-6ef5-11e0-a13b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz...</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Balin, Bryan J., ‘Sovereign Wealth Funds: A Critical Analysis’, 2008, p.4, <a href="http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/bitstreams/11501.pdf" title="http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/bitstreams/11501.pdf">http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/bitstreams/11501.pdf</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Fears about national security are greatly overblown, and are often simply an attempt to justify protectionist measures. Very few companies pose a national security risk, and those that do are covered by existing regulations – so that, for example, the USA could veto Dubai Port World’s bid to take over American ports. Most SWFs do not seek full control of companies they invest in, so they are not in a position to manipulate their assets for political gain, even if they wished to.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In reality, countries set up SWFs for economic reasons and they represent a major national investment, the value of which would be expensively destroyed if they once tried to abuse their position. Nor are there any actual examples of a country trying to exert political influence through its sovereign wealth fund.<br>Overall, tying a wide variety of states into the international economic and financial system is beneficial, as it gives them a stake in the peace which the global economy needs for prosperity and so makes them less likely to pursue aggressive foreign policies. Conversely, alienating the governments of other states by designating them as dangerous predators who cannot be allowed to invest in our companies is a sure way to create enemies.</p><div><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Rose, Paul, ‘Sovereign Wealth Funds: Active or Passive Investors?’, 2008. http://thepocketpart.org/2008/11/24/rose.html</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Sovereign wealth funds suffer from an almost total lack of transparency. Most countries maintain secrecy about the size of their funds and the extent of their holdings, their accountability to government, their investment strategies and their approach to risk management. Without knowing these things, it is impossible to gauge whether political or economic objectives will dominate the SWFs’ behaviour, or indeed whether they will make safe and responsible shareholders in any business – secrecy breeds corruption. For these reasons, Jeffrey Garten of Yale has argued that SWFs should be obliged to publish independently audited accounts twice a year. He has also pointed out that many countries operating SWFs protect their domestic economy from foreign competition and investment. We should demand reciprocity, so that countries seeking investments abroad must open up their own economies fully before they are allowed to hold significant assets elsewhere.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Garten, Jeffrey, ‘We need rules for sovereign funds, 2007. http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0b5e0808-454a-11dc-82f5-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz1bEemFdel</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The ownership of important businesses by sovereign wealth funds runs counter to the economic policy pursued by almost every government over the past 25 years. In the 1970s many states owned nationalised industries as part of an attempt at socialist economic planning that has now been discredited. State ownership distorted incentives, interfered with management and produced decades of underinvestment, poor service to consumers, and national economic failure with the most extreme example being the Soviet Union itself. Since the 1980s countries everywhere have followed the example of Thatcher’s Britain and privatised their industries, freeing them to compete efficiently and to generate more wealth and jobs than they had ever done in state hands. Going back to state ownership of business is a dangerous backward step, especially as it is now foreign governments that are doing the nationalising.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Sovereign wealth funds are highly beneficial for states with large financial surpluses. Traditionally they have been run by resource-rich countries which wish to diversify their assets to smooth out the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on their economies and revenues. The fund can then be drawn down then prices are low.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Indeed 30 of 38 SWFs in 2008 were established for such a stabilization role.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> By holding investments abroad, oil-rich countries such as Qatar and Norway have also built up valuable national reserves against the day when their fossil fuels eventually run out. Kiribati, a pacific island country, put aside wealth from mining guano from fertilizer. Now the guano is all mined but the $400million fund boosts the island’s GDP by a sixth.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> In any case, allowing all the income from natural resources into your domestic economy is well known to lead to wasteful investments and higher inflation – better to manage the revenues responsibly by using them to create wealth for the future. More recently many Asian countries with big current account surpluses and massive government reserves have sought higher returns than they could get through more traditional investment in US Treasury bonds. Again, this is a responsible strategy pursued by states seeking to do their best for their citizens.</p><div><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Ziemba, Rachel, ‘Where are the sovereign wealth funds?’, 2008, <a href="http://qn.som.yale.edu/content/where-are-sovereign-wealth-funds" title="http://qn.som.yale.edu/content/where-are-sovereign-wealth-funds">http://qn.som.yale.edu/content/where-are-sovereign-wealth-funds</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Lipsky, John, ‘Sovereign Wealth Funds: Their Role and Significance’, 2008. <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2008/090308.htm" title="http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2008/090308.htm">http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2008/090308.htm</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> The Economist, ‘Sovereign Wealth Funds Asset-backed insecurity’, 2008. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/10533428" title="http://www.economist.com/node/10533428">http://www.economist.com/node/10533428</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Restricting the activities of sovereign wealth funds is a form of protectionism, which is itself likely to stimulate further demands for barriers against globalisation. Western countries oppose protectionism when it is from other countries preventing western companies investing so it would be hypocritical to want protectionism against those same countries buying the firms that want so much to invest in emerging markets.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It should be remembered that almost 40% of SWF assets are controlled by SWFs from advanced industrialised states.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> As a result SWF investments abroad contribute to greater economic openness around the world. By exposing emerging economies and authoritarian states to developed world standards of transparency, meritocracy and corporate social responsibility, they will help to spread liberal values and raise standards. They will also give many more nations a stake in international prosperity through trade, encouraging cooperation rather than confrontation in foreign policy, and giving a boost to liberalising trade deals at the WTO. Finally as with all protectionism there is the risk that the SWFs will pull out their wealth and not invest as a result of protectionism resulting in lost jobs or jobs that would otherwise be created going somewhere more hospitable to SWFs.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> The Economist, ‘The rise of state capitalism’, 2008. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/12080735" title="http://www.economist.com/node/12080735">http://www.economist.com/node/12080735</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Drezner, Daniel W., ‘BRIC by BRIC: The emergent regime for sovereign wealth funds’, 2008, p.5. <a href="http://danieldrezner.com/research/swf1.pdf" title="http://danieldrezner.com/research/swf1.pdf">http://danieldrezner.com/research/swf1.pdf</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Ibid, p10</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

In the past their own companies were used as instruments of state power, for example BP’s origins lie in Britain’s attempt to dominate Iran’s (at the time known as Persia) oil wealth.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The developed world is always willing to buy assets on the cheap, as shown by American banks buying up Asian banks during the Asian Financial crisis at the end of the 1990s.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Recently SWFs have proved willing to channel a great deal of investment into poorer states, particularly in Africa, their investments have already surpassed the IMF and World bank’s,<a href="/print/17857#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> boosting their economies and assisting their long-term development through the provision of infrastructure such as roads and ports.

                    <p>The amounts sovereign wealth funds invest in the poorest countries is tiny compared to their overall portfolio. In 2008 the head of the World Bank Robert Zollick was attempting to persuade sovereign wealth funds to invest just 1% of their assets in Africa.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Investment by SWFs in Africa is not all good. Sovereign wealth funds are guilty of bad behaviour in the developing world. Some government-backed firms from China and the Arab world (not all of the SWFs) have provided capital to maintain some of Africa’s worst rulers in power, in exchange for the opportunity to gain access to the natural resources of their misruled states. Sudan for example has sold 400,000 hectares to the United Arab Emirates.<a href="/print/17857#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This has allowed dictators to ignore the conditions (e.g. for political freedoms and economic reforms) attached to funding offered by western aid donors and international institutions such as the World Bank. It also contrasts sharply with the behaviour of western companies, who are led to act more responsibly by pressures from their own governments, investors and media.</p><div><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Stilwell Amy, and Chopra, Geetanjali S., ‘Sovereign Wealth Funds Should Invest in Africa, Zoellick Says’, 2008. <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:21711325~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html" title="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:21711325~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html">http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:21711325~pag...</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17857#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> The Economist, ‘Buying farmland abroad, Outsourcing’s third wave’, 2009. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/13692889" title="http://www.economist.com/node/13692889">http://www.economist.com/node/13692889</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
