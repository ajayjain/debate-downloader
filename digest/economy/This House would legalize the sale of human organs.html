    <h1 class="print-title">This House would legalize the sale of human organs</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>As our knowledge of surgical and diagnostic techniques has increased with time, so has the success rate of organ transplants. However, the number of patients who require organ transplants exceeds the number of organs available, particularly if the patient has a rare blood type<a href="/print/17785#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> or belongs to an ethnic minority where organ donations are even lower than normal<a href="/print/17785#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. For example, although black people are three times more likely than the general population to develop kidney failure, and the Asian community has a particularly high demand for organs, organ donation within these groups is relatively low<a href="/print/17785#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. It is important for the donor and recipient to have the same blood type and similar genetic make-up in order to minimize the change of the receiver’s body rejecting the organ<a href="/print/17785#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. More than 10,000 people in the UK currently need a transplant, and 1,000 people die every year while on the waiting list<a href="/print/17785#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>. In the US, over 100,000 people are still on the waiting list<a href="/print/17785#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>. Although these figures are astonishing in themselves, the genuine figure is probably higher, inflated by the deaths of patients who are never waitlisted for a transplant. Some patients are never placed on the waiting list because they have certain habits – such as smoking<a href="/print/17785#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> – and the precious few organs available are prioritised for patients who fit recipient categories.</p><p>The sale of human organs offers a possible solution to this crippling shortage of organs. There is already an established black market trade in organs<a href="/print/17785#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a><a href="/print/17785#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>. Entrepreneurs offer British and Western patients the opportunity to receive privately financed transplants in countries such as India and Malaysia<a href="/print/17785#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a>. In 2006, investigators discovered that Chinese hospitals were providing organ transplants using the organs of executed prisoners<a href="/print/17785#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a>. In 1983, Dr. Barry Jacobs requested that the US government should create a fund to compensate the families who donate the organs of their deceased relatives.<a href="/print/17785#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> He also proposed a business plan to buy kidneys from living donors to transplant to American patients<a href="/print/17785#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a>. However, these is still plenty of opposition to these ideas, and the National Organ Transplantation Act of 1984 still prohibits the sale of human organs from both dead and living donors<a href="/print/17785#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a>.</p><p>The proposition line could argue that organs are the property of the donors, and so they have a right to do with them as they wish. In this case of buying human organs, it is much easier to argue that the profits would go to the donor rather than (for example) hospitals or governments which may not have a vested interest in those concerned. It would be useful to outline in the mechanism that these organs will be transferred through a unique medical group or business which has the technology available to match up donors to potential recipients and so avoid potential medical complications as far as possible. After this, it would be like any other financial transaction. This debate will focus on the United Kingdom, but the arguments would be relevant to most countries considering this policy change.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <em>Comprehensive Transplant Center,</em> <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/transplant/Programs/InKTP/blood_type.html">http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/transplant/Programs/InKTP/blood_type.html</a>, accessed 19/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <em>Blood and Transplant. </em>“Black and minority ethnic communities.” <a href="http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/how_to_become_a_donor/black_and_other_minority_ethnic_communities/black_and_other_minority_ethnic_communities.jsp">http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/how_to_become_a_donor/black_and_other_minority_ethnic_communities/black_and_other_minority_ethnic_communities.jsp</a>, accessed 19/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Ibid, <a href="http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/how_to_become_a_donor/black_and_other_minority_ethnic_communities/black_and_other_minority_ethnic_communities.jsp">http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/how_to_become_a_donor/black_and_other_minority_ethnic_communities/black_and_other_minority_ethnic_communities.jsp</a>, accessed 19/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> <em>American Association of Kidney Patients,</em> <a href="http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/transplant-compatibility/index.cfm">http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/transplant-compatibility/index.cfm</a>, accessed 19/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn5"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> <em>Blood and Transplant. </em>“Organ Donation.” <a href="http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/default.jsp">http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/default.jsp</a>, accessed 19/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn6"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="">[6]</a> <em>United Network for Organ Sharing. </em><a href="http://www.unos.org/">http://www.unos.org/</a> accessed 19/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn7"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" title="">[7]</a> <em>Cleveland Clinic. </em><a href="http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/lung_transplantation/hic_lung_transplant_your_commitment_to_good_health.aspx">http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/lung_transplantation/hic_lung_transplant_your_commitment_to_good_health.aspx</a>, accessed 19/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn8"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8" title="">[8]</a> MacKinnon, 2008, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7493466.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7493466.stm</a>, accessed 19/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn9"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9" title="">[9]</a> <em>Havoscope: Black Markets</em>. <a href="http://www.havocscope.com/black-market-prices/organs-kidneys/">http://www.havocscope.com/black-market-prices/organs-kidneys/</a>, accessed 19/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn10"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10" title="">[10]</a> Kram, <a href="http://www1.american.edu/ted/prisonorgans.htm">http://www1.american.edu/ted/prisonorgans.htm</a>, accessed 19/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn11"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11" title="">[11]</a> BBC News, 2006, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/5386720.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/5386720.stm</a>, accessed 19/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn12"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12" title="">[12]</a> Goodwin, <a href="http://law.slu.edu/healthlaw/journal/archives/Goodwin.pdf">http://law.slu.edu/healthlaw/journal/archives/Goodwin.pdf</a>, accessed 20/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn13"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref13" name="_ftn13" title="">[13]</a> Ibid, <a href="http://law.slu.edu/healthlaw/journal/archives/Goodwin.pdf">http://law.slu.edu/healthlaw/journal/archives/Goodwin.pdf</a>, accessed 20/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn14"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref14" name="_ftn14" title="">[14]</a> 98<sup>th</sup> Congress, 1984, <a href="http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/PL98-507.pdf">http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/PL98-507.pdf</a>, accessed 20/08/11</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>The ethics of private healthcare are not in question here; indeed, the UK government has stated that as many people as possible should be encouraged to pay for private healthcare in order to relieve the strain on national resources<a href="/print/17785#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Critics have understood this as the government prolonging waiting lists until the patients ‘remove themselves’ either by going private, or dying<a href="/print/17785#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. There is, however, a general understanding that the NHS in the UK is overburdened and that increased private healthcare would help to balance this<a href="/print/17785#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. Meanwhile, in the US, private healthcare is the norm<a href="/print/17785#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. Allowing the sale of organs is merely an extension of this principle and provides utilitarian benefit. Not only would those who are able to pay for an organ enjoy a much better chance at recovery, but there would be more time, space, and resources for the people who could not afford to do this privately.</p><div><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <em>On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing [blog]</em>, 2011 <a href="http://www.onaquietday.org/2011/07/29/nhs-news-review-94/">http://www.onaquietday.org/2011/07/29/nhs-news-review-94/</a>, accessed 20/08/11<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> 98<sup>th</sup> Congress, 1984 <a href="http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/PL98-507.pdf">http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/PL98-507.pdf</a>, accessed 20/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Lister, 1999 <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/319/7203/191.1.full">http://www.bmj.com/content/319/7203/191.1.full</a>, accessed 20/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> BBC News 2009, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8201711.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8201711.stm</a>, accessed 20/08/11</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>If payment-for-organs is introduced as a general norm, this will extend to the state-financed hospitals which are so burdened in the first place. Few families would turn down the opportunity to receive ‘compensation’ or payment for the families of their loved ones which could ensure financial stability, particularly if the family member who died was the sole or main earner. Therefore, either these families will charge the hospitals the same prices, or they will refuse to donate the organs, and turn to a private market instead. Given that the black market price for organs can reach tens of thousands of pounds<a href="/print/17785#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, it seems unlikely that struggling health systems would be able to afford it, and this would only encourage an incredibly harmful disparity between the wealthiest and the poorest.

Several countries, including Spain and Austria have already adopted an opt-out system, and studies have shown that this policy has caused a dramatic increase in the number of donations.<a href="/print/17785#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> We can solve the organ shortage without all of the problems inherent in the proposition’s proposal.</p><div><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <em>Blood and Transplant. </em>“Opt In or Opt Out.” <a href="http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/newsroom/statements_and_stances/statements/opt_in_or_out.jsp">http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/newsroom/statements_and_stances/statements/opt_in_or_out.jsp</a>, accessed 21/08/11<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <em>Imperial College of London. </em>2006, <a href="http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/news/donors/">http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/news/donors/</a>, accessed 21/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> <em>Blood and Transplant. </em>“Survey shows huge support for organ donation.” <a href="http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ukt/newsroom/news_releases/article.jsp?releaseId=47">http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ukt/newsroom/news_releases/article.jsp?releaseId=47</a>, accessed 21/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> Johnson and Goldstein, 2003, <a href="http://webs.wofford.edu/pechwj/Do%20Defaults%20Save%20Lives.pdf">http://webs.wofford.edu/pechwj/Do%20Defaults%20Save%20Lives.pdf</a>.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Would the idea of ‘presumed consent’ stand up in any other area of the law, <em>particularly</em> in cases considering a drastic action performed on the body? The BMA system completely undermines the UK’s current conception of consent, particularly that you ‘must be given enough information to enable you to make a decision’<a href="/print/17785#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. There is no way to assess if a patient who has not opted-out of a system like the BMA proposes has truly had enough knowledge of the subject to make an informed decision – especially considering that 36% of the nationwide survey conducted by UK Transplant ‘were unaware the NHS Organ Donor Register existed’<a href="/print/17785#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Until the general public has a much, much better understanding of the donor system – in which case most citizens would likely opt-in anyway – this system is inherently flawed. Moreover, the potential impact on a grieving family, if they find out that their relative’s organs had been ‘presumptively’ taken, is very serious. Family objections are already a problem even in cases where the relative actively opted-in<a href="/print/17785#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>; this would continue to cause greater outrage if the BMA system were implemented.</p><div><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <em>Department of Health. </em><a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4066993.pdf">http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4066993.pdf</a>, accessed 21/08/11<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <em>Blood and Transplant. </em>“Survey shows huge support for organ donation.” <a href="http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ukt/newsroom/news_releases/article.jsp?releaseId=47">http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ukt/newsroom/news_releases/article.jsp?releaseId=47</a>, accessed 21/08/11</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Blood and Transplant, “How to become a donor”, <a href="http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/how_to_become_a_donor/questions/answers/answers_15.jsp">http://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/how_to_become_a_donor/questions/answers/answers_15.jsp</a>, accessed 21/08/11</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The notion of property over body parts is very complex, both legally and philosophically. Generally, judges have shown ‘abhorrence’ at the idea of defining human bodies or parts of, whether living or dead, as ‘goods or materials’<a href="/print/17785#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>; if a right to property over the body could ever be exercised, it appears most strongly where the individual shows ‘no intention of abandoning or donating it’<a href="/print/17785#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. While this continues to be an incredibly complex issue, it essentially demonstrates that there is no absolute right of property over an individual’s own body parts; it is open to interpretation in each case. A proposition line that grants authority to any potential donor over the selling of organs assumes a right of property which does not, in fact, exist. As such it can, and should, be prevented.</p><div><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Woodcock, 2001, <a href="http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice-clinical-research/body-parts-and-the-law/206118.article">http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice-clinical-research/body-parts-and-the-law/206118.article</a>, accessed 21/08/11<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Ibid, <a href="http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice-clinical-research/body-parts-and-the-law/206118.article">http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice-clinical-research/body-parts-and-the-law/206118.article</a>, accessed 21/08/11</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Even if there is not an ‘absolute’ right of property over organs, we still grant individuals to actively choose organ donation, or to refuse to. In this way, we do accept that each individual has a practical say over the use of their physical body, just as we must gain consent from a patient to allow a medical procedure<a href="/print/17785#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, or allow him or her to refuse it<a href="/print/17785#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. There is a huge tangible benefit in this motion – namely that fewer people will die when there is the option for them to receive organs – and this should take precedent over complicated legal theory which is often inconclusive one way or another. Just because law and philosophy do not definitively grant a right of property over the body, they do not definitively deny it either. The balance of harms lies firmly in favour of the motion because more people benefit, either financially or medically.</p><div><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Wheeler, 2006, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1963696/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1963696/</a>, accessed 21/08/11<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17785#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> BBC, 2009, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/witnesses/witnessethics/ethics_1.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/witnesses/witnessethics/ethics_1.shtml</a>, accessed 21/08/11</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
