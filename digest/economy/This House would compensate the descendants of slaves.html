    <h1 class="print-title">This House would compensate the descendants of slaves</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Slavery is the use or the threat of violence to make another do work without compensation, and usually involves the ownership of one person by another. It was abolished in the USA in 1865 and was universally abolished by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, although it has persisted in some countries to the present day. Given that their ancestors were abused, ought governments and/or corporations to be made to make reparations for slavery? There are different types of slavery. The traditional form of slavery (the one most people immediately think of) is chattel slavery, in which the person is viewed as personal property of the &#39;owner&#39;. Humans are bought and sold as commodities. It is, however, the least common form today. Another type is debt bondage, in which a person can agree to be used for unpaid labor in the event of being unable to repay a loan. There is not always a definite period of time given and the debt can be passed from one generation to the next. This is the most prevalent form of slavery today and usually occurs in developing countries. Human trafficking can involve being tricked or kidnapped into slavery. Forced labor tends to occur in war zones, where the threat of violence coerces people into slavery and it can include forced conscription, usually into militias and child soldiers.This debate focuses on reparations for slavery in the trans-Atlantic trade, because it is the area of trade for which African countries, Caribbean countries and African Americans campaign for reparations.</p>

                    <p>Slaves were entitled to compensation and, being deceased, that money should go to their descendants. This principle doesn't cease to be true over time&nbsp;– truth and justice don’t have sell-by dates. The most important thing to establish is the principle of reparation being right. The how is less important. A reasonable approach would be to say that individuals would have to establish a direct link between themselves and a slave (many can). The fact that doing so will be difficult does not mean that it should not happen. Dwelling on the practical difficulties is no real opposition. Practicalities come second: the focus should be on righting this wrong.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Simply because one's ancestor was entitled to payment does not mean their descendants are due that money, similar to how if one's ancestor committed a crime one is not held accountable. No wrong has been taken against the descendants of the slaves, only the slaves themselves.</p><p><br>Furthermore, the proposition states that practicalities ought come second, but practicalities are important insofar as ideals can never be realized fully in the real world; rather, we ought look at what is feasible so we can actually make strides towards what is right and wrong. In this sense, the idea of compensation is ridiculous. Firstly, how can we tell how much is owed to each individual slave&nbsp;– didn’t some slaves do more work than others? Secondly, How distant a descendent can one be, and still receive compensation? An eighth? A sixteenth? Many people who are or appear to be completely white, some of whom perhaps have no idea that an ancestor of theirs was a slave or even that they were colored, won’t benefit from this. This is made more likely by the fact that many slaves were effectively white – records show slaves who were as little as one 64th African were sold. Plenty of people who are descended from those that suffered cannot provide concrete proof – or, as discussed above, don’t even know it. If there has ever been a case for slavery reparations, it would have been in the generation or two after slavery ended. So, this point is flawed both theoretically and practically.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Many of the companies advocates suggest suing for reparations are only tangentially connected to the slave trade by long-forgotten predecessors. FleetBoston, for example, which grew from hundreds of predecessor banks, has a single predecessor, the Providence Bank, with a loan that went to a slave trader and assets derived from trade<sup>1</sup>. Should they be liable? Furthermore, most corporations don't have records from 150 years go. They're not obliged to. Moreover, without denying the fact that slavery was very wrong, it was legal to have slaves when people had them. It is wrong to pass laws that criminalize conduct that was legal when originally performed (for example, the Constitution enshrines this in its prohibition of ex post facto laws).<br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://idebate.org/www.brown.edu/Research/Slavery_Justice/documents/SlaveryAndJustice.pdf"> Brown University Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice, Slavery and Justice, Brown University, p.59</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Companies can be traced back over many generations, and can be proven to have profited from slavery. It's fair to take money from them. Recent settlements over the use of slave labor in World War II provide a clear precedent, as do legal liabilities for asbestos injuries. Moreover, even though it was legal slavery was a terrible, fundamental wrong. Even if legal at the time, any member of humanity should have realized that it was his duty to oppose it. It's the same position as with Nazi executioners&nbsp;– even though following an order to kill a Jew might have been legal under the Nazi regime, it was nevertheless wrong.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Without knowledge of each individual's suffering, there is no reasonable way to determine how much each person is due. Some individuals suffered much more than others. Should some descendents therefore receive more? Moreover, saying that everyone should deserve a certain fixed amount seems to deny the individuals who suffered their humanity by labeling each a slave, each doing the same work and suffering the same amount. On one hand, considering the horrors of slavery, would any amount ever really be compensation? On the other hand, some slaves benefited from being transported to a land of opportunity&nbsp;– and their descendents certainly gained. How can they be said to be worse off than the descendents of those left in disease and war-ravaged Africa?&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There doesn’t need to be a quantification of how much any individual suffered – all suffered the same gross indignity of being denied their freedom. Denial of liberty is a grievous wrong.&nbsp;Arguments about the supposed benefits of slavery for those who suffered under it are speculative and insulting, set against the great suffering generations of African-Americans endured. Far from being a land of opportunity, the United States continued to oppress black people for a hundred years after the formal end of slavery. Even today, African-Americans are the poorest social group. Finally, a comparison between the USA and Africa today is ill-informed: many of the problems of Africa can be traced to the slave trade and to the colonialism which followed it.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Clearly, forcing individuals to pay for the unjust actions of their ancestors is ridiculous – they were not the ones who committed the crimes, and people today are all aghast at the actions that were taken.&nbsp; This would violate the fundamental principle of ex post facto – people today do not believe that the punishment for the sins of the father should be passed on the son.

                    <p>Firstly, there are precedents for this kind of compensation. The notion of national responsibility for the acts of the past is displayed in Holocaust reparation – why is the suffering of Africans different to the suffering of Jews? Germany has paid billions not only to individual Jews, but also to the State of Israel. Compensation was also paid in 2001 to victims of the Tulsa race riots of the 1920s – or to their descendants. Secondly, although we normally do not hold descendants accountable for the sins of their fathers, the fact that they have benefitted from the atrocities committed from the crime means they have some form of accountability for repayment.</p>        </div>
