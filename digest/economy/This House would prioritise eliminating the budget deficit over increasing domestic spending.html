    <h1 class="print-title">This House would prioritise eliminating the budget deficit over increasing domestic spending</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The debt of the United states at the time of writing is approaching <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">$15 Trillion</a> by many measures and growing quickly (8 November 2011). However, that only covers national debt – the government’s debt – if all debts are included the figure increases to a massive $54 trillion. That requires a total annual interest payment of three trillion dollars.</p><p>The issue of debt is one that starkly divides decision makers between and within both major parties. National debt is a complicated issue and the United States is in an unusual, possibly unique, position in relation to its debt, as those other nations and institutions to whom the debt is owed simply cannot afford for the most powerful economy in the world to declare bankruptcy. In the case of many nations, their own currencies are pegged to the dollar, in the case of the Federal Reserve it would lose its purpose for existing and its source of revenue.</p><p>The reality is that if the US defaults on its debts then the whole world, not just the US, faces a problem. Discussions about bailing countries such as Italy pale into insignificance compared to a problem in the US. Equally from the point of view of the US taxpayer, a sizeable chunk of their taxes is simply going on paying the interest on debts. Indeed governments around the world get into trouble when they end up having to borrow simply to service the debt and thereby create new debt which will, in turn, need to be serviced.</p><p>To give this some historical background, the last time the United States was out of debt was during the presidency of Andrew Jackson in the 1830s. What the media refer to as the national debt is the government budget deficit – the national equivalent of the overdraft on a current account. The difference is thinking you’re out of debt because you’ve paid of the overdraft but ignoring the mortgage, the credit cards, the loan on the car and student loans. Clinton paid off the overdraft, Jackson bought the house back; they’re two quite different accomplishments.</p><p>Although this debate will focus on paying off the deficit (the overdraft) the other figures are given by way of context. At the time of writing the US Government deficit is running at about $1,300bn ($1.3tn) and has averaged around there in recent years and is predicted to stay at that level for the next few years. This means that, roughly, the government is spending about 10% more than it earns. It doesn’t take into account, for example, that the government owes pension payments that it hasn’t even started paying out but has received payments from workers who will want to collect it at some point in the future.</p><div class="field field-type-text field-field-debate-authors">

                    <p>Ultimately the US Government has to pay its bill just like everyone else. Ultimately maintaining a permanent deficit harms the economy creating both inflationary pressures and effecting interest rates.</p><p>However, these pressures are not the main source of concern. Although deficits in times of plenty are a grave concern, during a recession most economist agree that deficits may be necessary. However, the US is no longer ‘mostly in debt to itself’ as has been the case in the past.<a href="/print/18070#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p>Increasingly, its debt is owned by the major Asian economies; especially China.

                    <p>It is incredibly unlikely that China would ever call in its debts as any damage done to the dollar would be fairly insignificant compared to the impact on China’s own economy and currency.</p><p>America can afford to service its debts and doing so is a major stimulus to the global economy. Nobody has an interest in breaking the dollar, as doing so would cause a run on every bank in the world – including the Bank of China. China holds reserves roughly equivalent to M1 – cash in circulation in the US (although it’s worth nothing this represents about four percent of the actual dollars in the world) and so a massive release of dollar-denominated assets would hurt the dollar greatly. The results would see the price of oil, and most other commodities, skyrocket as they are priced in dollars and would bring the entire global financial system to a halt. China has no interest in either of these things happening.</p>        </div>

                    <p>At the end of the Clinton presidency the government was running at a healthy surplus following the longest sustained period of growth in US history. Bush Chose to spend that on tax cuts and two extremely expensive wars (the War in Iraq was the mostly costly war, in relative terms, in US history except for WWII). Obama was landed with the problems that Bush created, but has chosen to extend spending rather than control the deficit.As The country is no longer at war, there is no real reason to be running at a deficit.</p><p>Alan Greenspan, and many others, have pointed out that the impact of continued deficits is likely to be higher interest rates – at a time when the country can ill afford them – which will hurt the economy.<a href="/print/18070#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><div><a href="/print/18070#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/02/25/news/economy/greenspan/">Mark Gongloff. “Greenspan Warns Against Deficits”.

                    <p>The only ways to control the deficit, other than stimulating growth and the tax revenues it produces, would be either to cut services or to increase taxes. Both actions would harm the longer term objective of stimulating growth as they both take cash out of the real economy.</p><p>By contrast, focusing on domestic spending to restart the economy will produce long term stability; whether through stimulus packages or other methods.</p><p>The idea that there is no need to run at a deficit during a time of recession is absurd. In the light of the financial challenges currently faced by the US, but also in the longer term, it is vital that the government has the ability to run its expenses at a deficit to act as a stimulus.</p><p>The reality is that it is in the interests of everyone, not just Americans, for the US government to be able to spend relatively freely. Surpluses are nice but they are a luxury the world’s financial engine can rarely afford.</p>        </div>

                    <p>There really is no problem with the Federal Government running at a deficit virtually permanently – as it has for most of its history. There is no threat of a default as this would require any lender to commit financial suicide as a result.</p><p>The deficit allows the most powerful economic actor on earth to act as a stimulus to those in smaller roles. Paying down the debt reduces money supply and, ultimately, contracts the economy. By relying on the savings of nations like China, through bonds and other instruments, the US is furthering its traditional role of being the primary engine of global economic growth.<a href="/print/18070#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><div><a href="/print/18070#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a599qExwnfSQ&amp;refer=politics">Rich Millar. “Democrats Rubin, Schwarz Clash on Spending Versus Deficit Cuts”.

                    <p>It would be the height of irresponsibility for the US government to even think about giving anything a higher economic priority than the creation of jobs at a time when unemployment is running at 9.1%.</p><p>It is essential that the federal government uses its economic muscle to get Americans working again rather than settling fairly obscure points of economic theory.</p><p>Taking money out of the system will cost jobs and hurt business, it will also lead to redundancies in the public sector.

                    <p>At some point the US needs to come to terms with its debts and a gradual collapse of confidence in the US’s ability to pay its debts will not help the American economy or anyone else’s.
