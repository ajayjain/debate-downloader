    <h1 class="print-title">This house would create a national lottery</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>A lottery is a form of gambling whereby lots are drawn and, depending on selections, prizes handed out. Many countries have lotteries which raise revenues for various levels of government as well as often providing a charitable donation to numerous worthy causes. The lotteries are usually monopolies granted by the government to private companies who take a slice of the profits and turn the rest over to the state. Income from state lotteries is often devoted to special categories of spending, partly in order to make playing the game more attractive to the public; in the USA states often use lottery funds for education, in Britain they are pledged to areas such as sport, the arts and charities. Most lotteries involve tickets purchased from local vendors, these may be pre-printed with digits or carry a selection of numbers chosen by the purchaser. Draws are usually made on national television with a frequency which varies from country to country, but in almost every case huge media and advertising attention surrounds the event. Proponents argue that lotteries provide unique, life-changing opportunities for winners whilst providing a source of revenue separate from traditional, antagonistic direct tax methods. Opponents maintain that national lotteries only serve to encourage and foster addictions to gambling and that it is an implicit taxation that in fact only works in favour of the already-wealthy.</p>

                    <p>Studies have shown that gambling can have a physiologically addictive element, similar to smoking a cigarette<sup>1</sup>, and both actions are shown to have a negative impact on people's lives. Why then is there a moral discrepancy in governmental policy here? According to official NHS Statistics, smoking cost the NHS in the UK&nbsp;£5.2 billion in 2005/06,&nbsp;approximately 5.5% of total healthcare&nbsp;costs<sup>2</sup>. This is a huge sum of public money devoted to help people stop smoking and deal with the physical side-effects. Even if gambling does not carry the same health risks, it should surely still be on the same side of government policy as something damaging to society that should be treated rather than encouraged.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1013204.stm">BBC</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1013204.stm"> News (2000, November 8).

                    <p>As long as it is the case that these odds are available to players, just as dietary information is made available on fast food or the dangers of smoking clearly displayed on the packets, then people should be free to choose whether or not to play the lottery. Whether or not the government is involved in the process does not affect that fundamental choice. Government money spent on anti-smoking campaigns and through the NHS does not stop them from being involved in a product-specific taxation system. Stephanie Saul argues in the New York Times that American governments make so much out of tobacco taxation that smoking will never be banned<sup>1</sup>, and the same logic can be applied here to lotteries. While for some people gambling is a serious issue, for most it is a choice through which the government can gain money that can be used to help people.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/weekinreview/31saul.html"> Saul, S.

                    <p>It is a widely known fact that a large proportion of the money made from selling lottery tickets goes directly to good causes and schemes run by the government to help improve the lives of the people who buy the tickets in the first place. The National Lottery (UK) was initially founded on the principle of providing funding for the arts, sport and heritage with funding for projects that would not otherwise get off the ground, and in recent years there has been a drive by the government to return the distribution of lottery money to those causes<sup>1</sup>. According to the official National Lottery website, "Camelot already runs the most cost-efficient lottery in Europe - an achievement that has helped the UK National Lottery to generate over&nbsp;£26 billion for the Good Causes, and counting"<sup>2</sup>. This is an incredible sum of money, made possible by the fact that government endorsement allows for greater awareness of the competition meaning more players and more money going to charity. Were the lottery to be de-nationalised, there would be no guarantee of these essential donations - the lottery would simply become another form of gambling which profits the organisers above all else.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/7490.aspx">Department</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span><a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/7490.aspx"> of Culture, Media and Sport.

                    <p>They don't always give as much as they say they can. A BBC News article from 2001 highlights how changeable the positive aspects of the National Lottery in the UK can be<sup>1</sup>. Governmental involvement is also a drain on the possible resources that could be donated to good causes. There is no denying that the money donated is a good thing, but why should the government take a 12% cut of the profits<sup>2</sup> on top of the running costs of the system. If the government was to be removed from the process whilst maintaining the legislation that ensures the donations to good causes then that 12% (which works out as a very large amount of money) could also go to the good causes. If people do indeed buy their tickets in the knowledge that a lot of their money is going to help people, they would surely rather it go to those causes rather than the government. The argument for lotteries based on their charitable successes are of course fundamentally flawed - the tickets are purchased with the aim to win the game, not to give to charity. If people were to donate the same amount of money directly to the causes they inadvertently benefit, they would have almost the same chance of winning millions whilst benefiting the charities and schemes even more.<br><sup>1</sup> Talking Point.

                    <p>Governmental involvement is essential in ensuring that a large proportion of the money goes to help the public. For example, the London 2012 Olympics will receive around 2.2 billion pounds<sup>1</sup>, providing funding for buildings such as the main Olympic Stadium. Without the National Lottery then, the Olympic Games would have been much more expensive for the taxpayer, and the country would not be able to put on the spectacle it now plans to. This is just one example of how government regulation in lotteries can ensure that the profits raised go where they are needed - people are not paying any extra to help fund projects such as the Olympic Games, but by choosing to buy a lottery ticket the government ensures that some of that money goes to useful projects.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.national-lottery.co.uk/player/p/goodcausesandwinners/london2012/yourvenues.ftl">National Lottery.

                    <p>That this is a voluntary purchase does not negate it as a tax. The Olympic Games do not benefit the vast majority of the people who buy lottery tickets. Robert K. Barney points out in The New York Times that the benefits are short term - "such an endeavor is fleeting and the monuments built for the spectacle in the form of stadiums and sporting venues shortly become little more than ghostly reminders of once glorious days"<sup>1</sup>. Andrew Zimbalist points out in the same article that, "Montreal's 1976 Olympics left the city with $2.7 billion of debt that it finally paid off in 2005" - there is no guarantee that the money spent from the lottery fund will in fact be economically beneficial to anyone. Governmental promotion and interference in lotteries can as such move money away from potentially more deserving causes to provide a temporary boost in popularity from the general public. Ultimately the question comes down to whether or not the money made has benefits beyond the moral issues involved in gambling. While there are positives to lottery funded projects, the distribution of these funds could never be truly fair, and they will continue to benefit a minority rather than the individuals that actually purchase tickets.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/do-olympic-host-cities-ever-win/"> New York Times.

                    <p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem around the world, with organisations such as GamCare<sup>1</sup> set up to help people who have become 'compulsive gamblers'. Lotteries are generally played on a weekly basis - a habitual cycle that few people realise is a gambling problem. Governments should, if anything, be devoting resources to preventing such activities, not encouraging them. With the advent of internet gambling, the problem has greatly increased<sup>2</sup>. Using the UK's National Lottery as an example once more, it is clear that it has been designed not only to encourage people to play the lottery, but also to play a whole host of other "instant win" games which are far more addictive. Lotteries themselves are as such not the only issue here. They are generally controlled by an independent gambling organisation whose vested interest is to get people that play a weekly lottery into playing other games more regularly. The government should not be backing these organisations because of the negative effects gambling in this way can have.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.gamcare.org.uk/"> Gamcare. (n.d.).

                    <p>The National Lottery and other similar systems do not carry the same repetitive addictive nature as other more serious forms of gambling. People generally do not keep detailed records how much they are 'up or down' on lotteries, they are played simply on the off chance that one day you could win big. A paper in The Journal of Gambling Business and Economics argues that "from a public health perspective, the gaming industry, in collaboration with government and the community, must ensure that individuals receive suficient information to enable them to make responsible gambling choices"<sup>1</sup>. The odds of winning are clearly posted on all the more addictive 'instant win' games, for example on the game 'Classic Snakes and Ladders' the odds are given as "Overall odds for winning a prize: 1 in 2.97"<sup>2</sup>. Gambling does not result in the same health risks as other activities acceptable in society such as drinking alcohol and smoking, and for the majority of people lotteries are little more than a brief period of excitement for a small fee.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.divisiononaddictions.org/html/reprints/Blaszczynski_etal08.pdf">Blaszczynski, A., Ladouceur, R., Nower, L., &amp; Shaffe, H.

The system encourages a culture in which people assume that they can gain the rewards of wealth and success without actually being successful, and of course in the vast majority of cases this is utterly misguided. Studies have also shown that people who are, or at least feel that they are less well-off are far more likely to play lotteries<sup>1</sup> - they therefore create a culture of false hope among poorer people, and also encourage them to waste what little money they have on something that is of no use to them.

                    <p>The chances of winning the UK National Lottery are 1 in 13,983,816<sup>1</sup> - the Euromillions an even more ridiculous 1 in 116,531,800<sup>2</sup>. These numbers are so high it is hard to put them into any kind of meaningful terms, suffice it to say that mathematically, even if you had been playing every week for the last 2 million years you still probably wouldn't have won yet. Encouraging people to play these games is as such wrong, given that the governments who do so know that they are going to make a massive profit and that most of the people who play will get nothing. As Alicia Hansen argues in Lotteries and State Fiscal Policy, "A mandatory tax on a voluntary purchase is still a tax"<sup>3</sup> - it doesn't matter whether or not a person is choosing to pay for their lottery ticket, the government is still taking some of that money, and as such there should be proper regulation of where that taxpayers money goes.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.lottery.co.uk/articles/overall-odds.asp"> National Lottery.

                    <p>People are fully aware of the odds when playing the lottery games - the reason they still play with such bad odds is the allure of the enormous jackpots. Of course, the jackpot isn't the only prize available in these games - the odds of getting something back for the money you spend are actually very good. There's a 1 in 53 chance of winning something on the national lottery, and an impressive 1 in 13<sup>1</sup> of winning something on the Euromillions. People pay for a lottery ticket just as they would a packet of cigarettes or an alcoholic drink - the governments take money for those things, so why not for the voluntary purchase of a lottery ticket. There is at least a chance of them redeeming some of that money from that choice, we do not question taxation of other choice purchases, so there are no grounds to stop the government involvement in the lottery. We must also remember that the government are not the only ones who make money from the system - local vendors and shopkeepers also take a cut which can in the case of smaller establishments be an important part of their income. Abolishing these lotteries, or even removing their broad ranging appeal would damage these small businesses.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.lottery.co.uk/articles/overall-odds.asp"> National Lottery.

                    <p>If there exists a mechanism, like the national lottery, whereby a government can raise its revenue outside of having to directly tax its population, it is obligated to do so. Direct taxation is a burden on the population, reducing discretionary spending; therefore governments should constantly be seeking to placate its populations by reducing the proportion of state revenue that comes from direct taxation. A study by the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries found that lottery sales raised $52.6 billion for states in 2005<sup>1</sup>. If the state's obligation is to look after the general interest of its population, which lie in lower direct tax rates as a proportion of total revenue, such a lucrative revenue stream cannot be ignored at the expense of maintaining direct tax rates.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/05/13/secret-government-tax-revenue-personal-finance-irs.html">Riddix</a> <span class="print-footnote">[17]</span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/05/13/secret-government-tax-revenue-personal-finance-irs.html">, M.

                    <p>Governments should not seek alternative revenue streams that permit a circumvention of the traditional, fairer direct tax methods. Direct taxation ensures, generally, that those able to pay proportionally more tax, do so. To reduce the proportion of government or state revenue that comes from such methods, in favour of a national lottery, means that those less able to pay are thereafter contributing a greater percentage of overall government revenue than they should be in an equitable system. Therefore, a national lottery does not serve anyone's interest but the states, for they can claim to be reducing direct tax on all tax bands, however in effect they are merely asking the less well-off to contribute proportionally more to the state coffers. Even if everyone spent the same on a lottery ticket each week, the fact that the majority of the population lie in the middle to lower tax brackets means that they thereafter are contributing more than they should be.</p>        </div>
