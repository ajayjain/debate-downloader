    <h1 class="print-title">This house would restrict the use of ‘fracking’ to extract natural gas from shale</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The precautionary principle has no universally accepted definition, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development defined it as 'Where there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.'<a href="/print/17803#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp;Shale gas is a term used to describe natural gas trapped as hydrocarbons within saturated rock formations, especially the sedimentary rock shale. Although quite widespread, until the past decade or so shale gas has not been much exploited as an energy source as it cannot be extracted easily and cheaply by traditional drilling techniques. In recent years this has changed as higher energy prices have made investment in shale gas fields more worthwhile, and improved extraction techniques have meant that unconventional sources of energy can now be exploited more easily. The main process involved in extracting shale gas is hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”), where a fluid is forced down a well to create a build-up of pressure in the rock below, forcing it to break up and allowing the gas contained within it to be recovered to the surface.</p><p>Shale gas formations can be found across much of the Eastern and Central parts of North America. Exploitation first took off in 2000; the number of wells in the Barnett shales of Texas grew from less than 600 to over 9000<a href="/print/17803#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> in the eight years to 2008. Other deposits being exploited include the Marcellus shales of New York and adjacent states, and the Haynesville shales in Louisiana and Texas. There is now interest in exploiting similar deposits across the border in Quebec, as well as in Poland and the UK within Europe.</p><p>Proponents of shale gas argue that it can provide a vast new source of reliable and economical energy, as well as helping industrial economies move towards a lower-carbon future. But sceptics doubt the economic viability of the sector, question its environmental impact, and raise serious safety concerns. These voices are becoming increasingly influential in the USA, and are attempting to block the exploitation of shale gas in Canada and Europe.</p><div><a href="/print/17803#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> United Kingdom Interdepartmental Liaison Group on Risk Assessment (UK-ILGRA), ‘The Precautionary Principle: Policy and Application’, <em>Health and Safety Executive</em>, <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/meetings/committees/ilgra/pppa.htm" title="http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/meetings/committees/ilgra/pppa.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/meetings/committees/ilgra/pppa.htm</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17803#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Pickett, Al ‘Barnett Shale Technology, Tenacity Lead to Success’, <em>The Permian Basin Petroleum Association Magazine</em>, Issue 5, August 2008, &nbsp;http://www.pbog.com/index.php?page=article&amp;article=26</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-curator">

                    <p>All forms of energy production place some burden on the environment, but compared to any other form of fossil fuel shale gas is limited in its impact. It does not produce huge open-cast pits like tar sands or level mountains like coal-mining, it does not need massive offshore rigs like oil wells or traditional gas extraction, and it does not pose the risk of oil spills like those in the Gulf of Mexico and the Niger Delta. Indeed, many people also object to renewable energy sources such as massive solar arrays, ranks of noisy wind-turbines against the horizon, or hydro-electric schemes that drown valleys and wreck river systems. With proper regulation, the impact of shale gas wells can be made acceptable to local communities, while better horizontal drilling techniques mean fewer wells will be required in the future than in the past, in Alaska horizontal drilling has meant that wells are only needed every four miles.<a href="/print/17803#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17803#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Pratt, Sara, ‘A Fresh Angle on Oil Drilling’, <em>Geotimes</em>, March 2004, http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/mar04/feature_horizdrill.html</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Climate change is the biggest problem facing our planet and it requires urgent action for us to shift to a low-carbon economy. Shale gas is simply another fossil fuel, releasing carbon into the atmosphere when it is burnt to provide power.

                    <p>Shale gas provides an important route to a low-carbon economy. Burning gas to generate electricity for lighting houses and powering factories (and also perhaps increasingly for powering “plug-in” automobiles) emits much less carbon than burning coal in traditional power-stations. At the same time, shale gas can provide much more energy in the next twenty years than renewable sources such as solar, wind and tidal energy can at present offer. So if we are serious about shutting down major polluters such as coal-burning power stations and petrol-drive automobiles, it is shale gas that can provide us with a realistic and affordable lower-carbon solution. Even if targets for renewable generation of electricity are met there will still need to be electricity generation by other sources and gas is the best option.<a href="/print/17803#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The environmental case for shale gas can be further strengthened by the use of carbon sequestration &nbsp;whereby new technology is employed to capture the carbon emissions as gas is burnt and to store it in underground rock formations, so that it is not released into the atmosphere, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is even researching how to do this in shale.<a href="/print/17803#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17803#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> 9<sup>th</sup> Transatlantic Energy Governance Dialogue, ‘Shale Gas: A Game Changer for European Energy Security?’ <em>Central European University</em>, 12-13 May 2011, <a href="http://www.globalenergygovernance.net/fileadmin/media/events/2011/event_2011_TEGD-9-conference-report.pdf" title="http://www.globalenergygovernance.net/fileadmin/media/events/2011/event_2011_TEGD-9-conference-report.pdf">http://www.globalenergygovernance.net/fileadmin/media/events/2011/event_...</a>, p.8<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17803#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Staff Writers, ‘Livermore Lab and American Shale Oil team to study carbon sequestration’, <em>Energy Daily</em>, 17 December 2008, <a href="http://www.energy-daily.com/reports/Livermore_Lab_And_American_Shale_Oil_Team_To_Study_Carbon_Sequestration_999.html" title="http://www.energy-daily.com/reports/Livermore_Lab_And_American_Shale_Oil_Team_To_Study_Carbon_Sequestration_999.html">http://www.energy-daily.com/reports/Livermore_Lab_And_American_Shale_Oil...</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

The supply of easily exploited conventional sources seems to have peaked, while the rapid growth of the Chinese economy has greatly increased demand.

Drilling for unconventional gas is an expensive business, requiring large sums to be laid out on leases for the land, drilling equipment, hydraulic fracturing processes, pipelines, etc. Some wells generate ultimately generate too little gas to pay for their overheads, so a lot of wells have to be drilled for any investment to pay off.

                    <p>There is no great energy crisis that requires us to throw money at shale gas.

The development of liquefied natural gas supply chains from a range of countries has had a similar impact in the gas market. The price of oil and gas is very variable, reflecting changing issues of supply and demand, so there is no reason to assume that current higher prices will last.

                    <p>Hydraulic fracturing is not a new technique. It was pioneered as long ago as 1947<a href="/print/17803#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> and had already been used a million times by 1988, so any problems or dangers have had decades to emerge. As they have not, we can be confident that shale gas production is safe. And the implication of banning these techniques, already used for 30% of all US oil and gas extraction, will not only wipe out the shale gas industry. As it is estimated 90% of current oil and gas wells in the USA will require fracking to maximise their potential,<a href="/print/17803#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> a ban would have the effect of shutting down the whole American oil industry.</p><div><a href="/print/17803#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Montgomery, Carl T., and Smith Michael B., ‘Hydraulic Fracturing History of an enduring technology’, <em>JPT Online</em>, Vol. 62, No. 12, December 2010, p.27 &nbsp;http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2010/12/10Hydraulic.pdf<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17803#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Batdorf, Tiffany, ‘National Registry Provides Public and Regulators Access to Information on Chemical Additives’, <em>Interstate Oil &amp; Gas Compact Commission</em>, 11 April 2011http://www.iogcc.state.ok.us/national-registry-provides-public-and-regulators-access-to-information-on-chemical-additiv</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There is a difference between fracking which is occasionally used in standard drilling for oil and the much more regular use of fracking in order to extract shale gas. Most obviously it is more common. However there have also been significant changes in the technology. Fracking up to the end of the 1990’s used much less chemicals than current ‘slick water’ fracturing and fracturing is using about twice the amount of water as they were previously.<a href="/print/17803#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This should be enough change to mean there should be a halt to production until the science is certain.&nbsp;</p><div><a href="/print/17803#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Coal seam gas news, ‘Fracking, The DC Earthquake and Unclean Water’, 25<sup>th</sup> August 2011, http://coalseamgasnews.org/?p=1930</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
