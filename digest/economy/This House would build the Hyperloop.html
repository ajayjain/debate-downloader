    <h1 class="print-title">This House would build the Hyperloop</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>California is building a high speed railway line to link its two most populous areas; San Francisco and Los Angeles. The project is staggeringly expensive and has been criticised as too slow by Elon Musk, the creator of Paypal, Tesla, and SpaceX. Instead he suggests a new idea he calls the Hyperloop to be used between &ldquo;high traffic city pairs that are less than about 1500 km or 900 miles apart&rdquo;. Beyond 900 miles Musk believes that supersonic jets would be more economic &ndash; though of course at the moment there is no supersonic air travel. The route for which the proposal is initially designed from San Francisco to Los Angeles is only 350 miles so the Hyperloop would be the best possible mode of transport; it would be several times faster than any current commercial transportation method as well as being cheaper.</p>
<p>There are several main elements to the proposal;</p>
<p>First it is in a tube the whole distance. The reason for this is to reduce resistance. The tube would be at a much lower pressure than the outside world so there would be less density of air creating less resistance and so allowing faster speeds while using less energy. The tube itself would be on pylons and could be built above existing road infrastructure for much of the way, with the exception of when the corners on the roads are too tight.</p>
<p>Despite the low pressure there would still be a build up of air in front of the pod (the individual car in which the users are seated) essentially making it like a syringe with the pod pushing the air in front so once again building up resistance. The Hyperloop however would use a compressor fan to transfer air at high pressure to the bottom and rear of the pod. This would allow the creation of an aircushion &ndash; Musk suggests this is much the same as an air hockey table &ndash; underneath the pod so eliminating the need for wheels.</p>
<p>The Hyperloop would be powered by electricity. The pod would be initially accelerated by external round induction motors, as used by Musk&rsquo;s own Tesla cars, at the stations that would bring the pods to high speeds of around 700 mph. The limited resistance would mean there would be no motor operating most of the time but the pods would be given a reboost every 70 miles or so. The pods themselves would have batteries to power their fan and any internal electronics. As it is all electric Musk suggests that by placing solar panels along the top of the tube the Hyperloop would generate more than enough electricity to run itself so this would be a green method of travel.</p>
<p>The proposal for the Hyperloop provides two separate options for the system; either a passengers only system in which each pod would take 28 passengers, or one in which the pod would also accommodate 3 vehicles which increases the cost of the system.<a href="/print/62701#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>The Hyperloop would not be anything like any current transportation, Musk seems to have described the proposal quite accurately in the months before the announcement as a &ldquo;cross between a Concorde and a railgun and an air hockey table&rdquo;.<a href="/print/62701#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> It would be like concord in that it is an (almost) supersonic transportation system, a railgun in terms of how the propulsion is created and an air hockey table keeping the pods afloat.</p>

                    <p>Public transportation has not been getting much faster over the last few decades. The fastest method of transport, supersonic jets in the form of Concorde ceased operation in October 2003.<a href="/print/62701#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Even if at some point a new generation of supersonic planes are built these will not be ideal for travelling between cities that are comparatively close together. The time spent getting the plane up and down from cruising altitude means they would take longer over these short distances than a slower option at ground level. The Hyperloop at more than 700mph will be twice as fast as high speed rail. To take the different options on the San Francisco-Los Angeles route cars take 5hours 30minutes, the proposed high speed train would take 2hours 38minutes, by plane takes 1hour 15minutes whereas the Hyperloop would only take 35minutes.<a href="/print/62701#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>People are not always interested in the fastest possible option; they often want comfort as well. Trains allow riders to work or relax as well as travel the Hyperloop has little space for passengers to move around in. This means that passengers may actually be more productive on a train on which they can move around and work as they travel than they would be in a confined space on the Hyperloop.</p>

                    <p>The Hyperloop would be cheap to build. The pods themselves would only cost $1.35million each, the pressurised tube just $650million (or double if wanting vehicles), with only two stations their cost would only be $250million. The biggest cost would be the construction of the pylons carrying the tube which is estimated at $2.55 or $3.15billion. There is an estimated total cost of $4.06billion for the passenger only version or $5.31billion for the vehicle version. <a href="/print/62701#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This should be compared to the current cost for California&rsquo;s high speed rail project which is estimated to be $68billion while covering much the same ground.<a href="/print/62701#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>Less than $6billion seems to be suspiciously low. Some land would undoubtedly need to be purchased if only to allow for less tight corners. Added to this there would still be delays due to the need for permits for noise, light and vibration which will mean rising costs.<a href="/print/62701#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> A study of 250 major transport infrastructure projects has found that 90% of come in over budget and this escalation is 45% on rail projects.<a href="/print/62701#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> And it should be remembered that this is dealing with systems were we know the costs not something that is completely new. Additionally there would be costs associated with the closures of the main road routes between Los Angeles and San Francisco &ndash; though these might be moved to the people of California the cost would still be there.</p>

                    <p>The Hyperloop would be the cheapest mode of intercity transport possible. &ldquo;Transporting 7.4million people each way and amortizing the cost of $6 billion over 20 years gives a ticket price of $20 for a one-way trip for the passenger version of Hyperloop.&rdquo;<a href="/print/62701#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> There are very few additional costs. Usually the main cost for transportation beyond the infrastructure is the energy but the Hyperloop produces more energy than it uses so would make a profit here. There would be additional maintenance costs and some minor staff costs but this is unlikely to add too much to the ticket price. The Hyperloop would therefore be very price competitive compared to the $100 and up for flights.</p>

                    <p>While it seems reasonable that the cost will be low it is questionable that it will be quite as low as suggested. If the cost of construction rises &ndash; as it inevitably does &ndash; then because this is the basis for the pricing calculation the prices will surely go up.

                    <p>The plan for the Hyperloop is sound technically but would it work politically? It is unlikely that the California high speed rail project will be scrapped simply because there is a new competitor on the block. The Hyperloop has the advantage of being cheap but it is cheap because it is being built in the middle of an existing highway, the interstate-5. Building the Hyperloop would therefore cause traffic chaos so there would not be much political support.<a href="/print/62701#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Build it elsewhere and land would need to be bought just as with proposals for high speed rail.</p>
<p>Maglevs are, like the Hyperloop, practically sound &ndash; one travels from Shanghai Airport into the center of the city<a href="/print/62701#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> &ndash; but they have not been built. High speed trains, despite being slower, have been the preferred method for creating high speed transportation systems because they can easily connect into the existing rail infrastructure, a problem for both the Hyperloop and maglevs.</p>

                    <p>That there will be some opposition to such a construction is inevitable. This however does not matter in a rational look at the advantages and disadvantages of such a transportation system. The politicians will ultimately decide on the same calculus as everyone else.</p>
<p>That the Hyperloop does not connect into infrastructure in the same way that the maglevs fail to is not a relevant argument to the United States where there are few rail services to connect into. Instead the possibility of having a Hyperloop that transport vehicles invites the prospect of connecting into the road network. A much more useful alternative in California. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The Hyperloop is not the first proposal to use tubes with low &ndash; or no &ndash; pressure in them. A very high speed train was proposed by Robert M. Salter in 1972.

<p>Nor is this the first proposal for a pneumatic transport system; such trains were around in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.
