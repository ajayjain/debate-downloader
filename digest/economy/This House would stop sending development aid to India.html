    <hr class="print-hr" />
    <h1 class="print-title">This House would stop sending development aid to India</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>In November 2012 the UK&rsquo;s International Development Secretary, Justine Greening, announced that &ldquo;We [the British government] have agreed that the UK&#39;s programme of financial grant aid to India will end... We will finish existing financial grant projects responsibly, so that they all complete as planned by 2015.&rdquo;<a href="/print/47697#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Prior to this draw down India was the largest recipient of British bilateral aid receiving &pound;280million per year.</p>
<p>The change in policy came after the Pranab Mukherjee, at the time finance minister, told the Indian upper house &ldquo;We do not require the aid&hellip; It is a peanut in our total development exercises&rdquo; and the Indian Foreign Minister, Nirumpama Rao, proposed &ldquo;not to avail [of] any further DFID [British] assistance with effect from 1st April 2011,&rdquo; because of the &ldquo;negative publicity of Indian poverty promoted by DFID&rdquo;.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Things were not all one way as there was outcry in some areas of the British press at the Indians deciding to buy French Rafale fighters over the Eurofighter Typhoon in which Britain has a stake despite the scale of British aid.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>
<p>More broadly the changing economic circumstances of the two nations is prompting change. Although India is still much poorer than the United Kingdom on a per capita basis it is growing rapidly while Britain is mired in recession. India is even predicted to surpass the UK, and other Western European powers France and Germany, in terms of total GDP by 2022.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p>
<p>With a rapidly growing economy and a large middle class India is increasingly an odd recipient for development aid. The British government defines this development aid (or Official Development Assistance) as &ldquo;Grants and concessional loans for development and welfare purposes from the government sector of a donor country to a developing country or multilateral agency active in development. ODA includes the costs to the donor of project or programme aid, technical cooperation, debt forgiveness, food and emergency aid, and associated administration costs.&rdquo;<a href="/print/47697#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> Much of which India, and many Britons now argue India should be doing for itself rather than taking aid from abroad.</p>

                    <p>India is a booming economy with GDP growth of 7% over most of the last twenty years, and it is likely to overtake the UK economy within a decade.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> As a result development aid today to India is small by comparison to what India itself can and does spend on its poorest citizens. The UK gives just &pound;280 million per year, less than 0.04% of India&rsquo;s GDP<a href="/print/47697#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> and only enough to provide &pound;1 per year for every one of India&rsquo;s poorest.</p>
<p>This foreign aid is therefore not essential for poverty reduction in India. Indeed China has been the country most successful at reducing poverty and it has done it through economic growth not large amounts of development aid.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Aid money should therefore go to countries that really do need the money for development rather than those who are already succeeding at financing it themselves.</p>

                    <p>The geography of poverty has changed; in 1990 94% of those in poverty lived in &lsquo;low income countries&rsquo; today that is down to 28%. The rest live in &lsquo;middle income countries&rsquo; that are often fast growing and able to provide much of their own poverty reduction funding.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Should all money go to those few countries that are still classed as &lsquo;low income&rsquo;? Instead it must be recognised that the impact of aid is on individuals not the nation as a whole. Aid that builds a school and provides for teachers will have little impact on the whole of the nation but a large impact on those who are able to attend school where they would not have had the chance before.</p>

                    <p>Aid is simply a continuation of the &ldquo;white man&rsquo;s burden&rdquo; and is therefore demeaning to the countries where it is meant to help. It implies that western countries have to provide money to those who are less &lsquo;developed&rsquo; in order to develop them. This sounds very similar to westerners having to go out into the world in order to civilize the other countries and civilizations around the world. This similarity is made even closer when western aid has strings and institutions like the IMF impose &lsquo;liberalisation&rsquo; of markets as it did for India at the end of the 1980s.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Far from providing help it is imposing western ideas and values on others.</p>

                    <p>It is nonsense to compare aid with the west&rsquo;s actions during the nineteenth century. Yes the west with aid sometimes wants to encourage its own values but this is a long way from forcing those values on the other state. The IMF may demand certain changes and liberalisation but regardless of how much India needed the help it could have said no.</p>

                    <p>It is clear that the donor countries do not know how best to spend the money they give as aid. Instead they want their money spent on the latest development fad whether this is the privatisation of basic services, microcredit, conditional cash, or particular infrastructure projects.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Development can also be misspent as a result of corruption and a lack of oversight, for example the UK suspended its aid to Uganda as a result of indications it was being misused by the Ugandan government and not &ldquo;going towards helping the poorest people lift themselves out of poverty&rdquo;.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The Lords Economic Affairs select committee explained why this is the case; &ldquo;aid is essentially seen by those entrusted with it as &quot;free money&quot;, whose loss will go unnoticed by the giver and whose appropriation is nothing like as morally reprehensible as appropriating local tax revenue&rdquo;.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>

                    <p>It is likely true that people on the ground sometimes see aid as &lsquo;free money&rsquo;. But the existence of corruption shows a need for greater accountability and more pressure from donors to ensure that occurs rather than less. Leaving a country because of corruption would simply show unwillingness to tackle one of the major issues that need to be tackled in order to ensure development.</p>
<p>Development aid is sometimes spent on implementing schemes that may be the result of a new idea that may not work that becomes a &lsquo;fad&rsquo;. But to object to this is to object to innovation; new ideas must be tried out on the ground before the development community knows for sure they won&rsquo;t work. Development thinking is moving towards just handing out cash rather than subsidies; will this work? We don&rsquo;t know, but won&rsquo;t know for sure until it is tried more comprehensively than it has been so far.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>It does not make sense that India should receive aid simply because it still has poor people. Aid is used to help when the government cannot provide for its own people and India clearly already provides the vast majority of help for its own people and will provide more and more as the economy grows. The absolute numbers make very little difference because aid at current levels will never pull all 1.4 billion out of poverty at once. The government of India is improving he conditions of its poor so aid should be used somewhere where the government is less capable.</p>

                    <p>Clearly if India could end poverty within the country it would do so, however at the moment it cannot. If those in India who are not poor (considering this to mean earn more than $13 a day, the US poverty line) were to give 100% of their income above this level to those who live on less than $1.25 per day they would still not eliminate poverty in the country. &ldquo;Indeed, appropriating all of the incomes of those living in India above the US poverty line would cover only a modest fraction of the country&rsquo;s aggregate poverty gap.&rdquo; So India does not yet have the domestic capacity to eliminate poverty on its own.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

Equally the same amount of development aid can still make a similar amount of difference to the individuals it is targeted. It may potentially make even more of a difference in the richer country because that country has the infrastructure to ensure that the aid is sustainable and effective.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> For example an aid program may help poor farmers to grow more food but that aid is much more sustainable and valuable if there is a road network so that they can sell some of their produce. In India UK aid has helped 1.2 million children go to school in the past 10 years<a href="/print/47697#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> and this investment is potentially made more effective by India having universities these children could go on to attend if they wish.</p>

                    <p>Currently the culture of giving in India is not mature enough to enable India to fight poverty on its own. Aid to India therefore provides more than one role. It does not just provide the money and supplies that the poorest need, it also encourages India to do more. When aid is needed to put primary children into school as a result of the mere 3% of national income spent on education it encourages the Indian government and people to spend more on alleviating their own compatriot&rsquo;s poverty.<a href="/print/47697#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>The opposite is true; aid results in less Indian spending on poverty not more. In a few rare cases there may be sufficient media coverage of an aid program to shame the government into action but most of the time if others are spending that simply means the Indian government will save its own money.
