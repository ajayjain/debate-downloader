    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes that government does more for liberty than the market does</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>It has long been an allegation, made by Republicans, that Democrats are in love with big government and that this poses a threat to individual liberty. They claim that free markets are the only true defender of individual freedoms and that democracy and laissez faire economics are, effectively, two sides of the same coin. The argument essentially says that low taxation and light regulation mean freedom, liberty and democracy. The linkage between “free markets and free peoples” was a fundamental tenant of Reagan Conservatism (as it was for Thatcher on the other side of the Atlantic) and it has been a dominant theme for the party ever since.</p><p>The logical conclusion of this belief is borne out in the rhetoric of the party – if not always in their actions.</p><p>Democrats, on the other hand, are far more relaxed about the role of government. Their ties to organized labour specifically but also to other traditions on the left tend to mean that they see collective action as being a virtuous method to tackle social ills and see no great difficulty with the state being an actor in events. However, for them the market is a threat to liberty, denying individual choices in strip malls and individual rights in sweatshops. They argue that, far from being the friend and champion of liberty the market needs the oversight of an elected government, which can act as an advocate for individuals’ rights in a world dominated by huge corporate institutions.</p><p>A large part of this divide may well lie in the simple, knee-jerk tendency of democrats and Republicans to lay any evil, perceived or real, at the door of big business or big government respectively.</p><p>Republicans promote themselves as champions of individual rights against an over-mighty state, while Democrats see a greater role for collective action in securing justice and liberty for ordinary citizens. Clearly neither of these stereotypes is universally true for either party. However, within the mind-set of each party their respective views of the role of government are powerful motivators.</p><p>It would no doubt come as a surprise to many on both sides of the aisle to know that the two presidents who oversaw the most rapid growth in government expenditure in recent times were George Bush Jnr and Ronald Reagan. However, that is not the focus of this debate.</p><div class="field field-type-text field-field-debate-authors">

                    <p>The idea that free markets make for free people becomes derisible the moment you look outside the West. In the developing world unfettered corporations routinely act again the interests and wishes of the people. From the privatisation of natural resources in Latin America and Africa to undermining the prices charged by indigenous farmers the world over. Even Russia, the poster child of the Reagan revolution is now controlled jointly by a dictator and a handful of oligarchs.</p><p>The so called free market is anything but free, it has simply created corporate behemoths that focus on this year’s profit reports, not the long term interests of the communities they destroy.

                    <p>Free markets allow people to see the opportunities available in the free world. The capacity to buy and sell, to freely trade allows people to realise that they are not at the beck and call of anybody. Added to that, the Market acts as the ultimate arbiter. It follows the choices of individuals and, therefore, makes them supreme. It has no time for the idea that there is only one way to do things or that a consumer should make a choice because they are told to. It only appeals to the views people express trough their choices in buying products and giving their labour. It is the very definition of freedom.</p>        </div>

                    <p>This is simply not true. Anyone who has ever tried to get concrete and meaningful information out of a government agency knows that this is untrue. Even in many western democracies there is no guarantee of transparency in government, in France Former President Mitterrand was able to keep it secret that he had cancer.<a href="/print/17796#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p>Vested interests are keen to keep their relationships with politicians secret so that any decision they do influence appears to be impartial and, therefore, the best option.</p><p>If knowledge is power then the government seems determined to make sure that it has both.</p><p>Companies are not allowed to form monopolies or cartels through shady deal hammered out in back room deals because it distorts the free market. Government by contrast consists of almost nothing but such deals. If a director seeks to conspire against the interests of the people, they go to gaol.

                    <p>From the old communist dictatorships to modern ones like Venezuela and Iran, one feature shared by all such regimes is a rejection of the market. Power is exercised in non-democratic states by telling people what they can and can’t do with their money; what they can’t buy (whether for religious or political reasons); what they can or can’t do for reasons of ideology or morality. This is what destroys freedom – telling people that they can’t earn as much as they want to and spend it how they choose. That is anathema to the market, just as it is to freedom. A free market provides both the motivation and the method for people to be free. It should be no surprise that of the top ten countries in terms of economic freedom;<a href="/print/17796#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> five are also in the top ten for personal freedom;<a href="/print/17796#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, and Denmark.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17796#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> The Heritage Foundation, ‘Ranking the Countries’, 2011 Index of Economic Freedom, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/index/Ranking" title="http://www.heritage.org/index/Ranking">http://www.heritage.org/index/Ranking</a></p></div><div id="edn2"><p><a href="/print/17796#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[ii]</a> The 2011 Legatum Prosperity Index, <em>Legatum Institute</em>, <a href="http://www.prosperity.com/rankings.aspx" title="http://www.prosperity.com/rankings.aspx">http://www.prosperity.com/rankings.aspx</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The reality of how a market works is that companies are all too happy to cosy up with some of the most unpleasant regimes on the planet. From the Potentates of the OPEC nations to generals in every military dictatorship around the world.</p><p>Equally companies don’t mind if their labour is free but they certainly expect it to be cheap. There is no family in the world that, given the choice, would rather see their children working long hours in a sweatshop than in school. There are many forms of tyranny; poverty is simply the most prevalent. Some of the most powerful proponents of the free market in the world have no difficulty working with Saudi Arabia or selling armaments to military dictatorships, frequently to be used against US troops.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The market isn’t free and neither are the choices it offers. The Free Market policies of successive administrations have done nothing but create a series of corporate giants that dominate customers and suppliers. In the retail sector, for example, giants such as Wal-Mart and Tesco can pay suppliers whatever they choose, regardless of the cost of production. Equally they can charge customers whatever they choose once they’ve driven local rivals out of business. Republicans are keen to talk about a free market but the moment someone talks about scraping farm subsidies or removing Bush’s steel tariff they tend to panic. Likewise they are all in favour of huge government subsidies to armaments manufacturers and energy giants but seem to have a problem with protecting small, local businesses.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is worth noting that the form of words Jefferson ultimately used in the Declaration of Independence “Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness” had its origins in either Locke’s "life, liberty, and property “ or the Virginia declaration, Written by George Mason “That all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety. “<a href="/print/17796#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p>The United States was founded as a nation of trade and traders. Jefferson amended this view slightly as he felt that property could be taxed toward the common good.
