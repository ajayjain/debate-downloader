    <div class="print-content"><p>Corruption is operationally defined as the misuse of entrusted power for private gain. Facilitation payments, where a bribe is paid to receive preferential treatment for something that the receiver is required to do by law (e.g. an official processing a license application), constitute "according to rule" corruption. Corruption "against the rule", on the other hand, is a bribe paid to obtain services the receiver is prohibited from providing (e.g. a policeman ignoring a crime or favourable marking of a student’s examination paper).</p><p>The phenomenon of corruption has complex reasons that include flaws in legal system, the lack of democratic traditions and political accountability, social and economic difficulties, and low pay for public officials. Corruption affects people's lives in a multitude of ways. In the worst cases, corruption costs people’s lives. In countless other cases, it costs their freedom, health, or money. It is becoming an international problem due to increasing level of globalisation and international trade.&nbsp;</p><p>Transparency International (TI) – the biggest organisation that fights corruption on a global level - believes that keeping corruption in check is only feasible if government, business and civil society work together and agree on a set of standards and procedures they all support.<a href="/print/17870#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17870#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Transparency International, ‘Frequently asked questions about corruption’, <a href="http://www.transparency.org/news_room/faq/corruption_faq">http://www.transparency.org/news_room/faq/corruption_faq</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>People are often made to give bribes to officials because of unfavourable economic, social or bureaucratic conditions. Officials may refuse to serve clients unless they are paid. For example in Delhi police officers regularly take lunch without paying and more senior officers take 10,000 each month to allow the restaurant to stay open late.<a href="/print/17870#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In those countries where state institutions are extremely corrupted, refusal to give a bribe may cost financial losses for business representatives or even health and liberty for citizens who need medical service and access to justice.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17870#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Burke, Jason, ‘Corruption in India: ‘All your life you pay for things that should be free’, guardian.co.uk, 19 August 2011, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/19/corruption-india-anna-hazare">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/19/corruption-india-anna-hazare</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The position of civil society plays a key role in reducing corruption. Its action in taking a moral stand against corrupted officials is an important precondition for effective anticorruption policy. Hence, citizens who put up with the necessity to give a bribe become a part of the problem. It is not just the case of public officials abusing their positions, but of people who are tempted to choose the easiest way out. Recent developments in India show how quickly expectations can change once people begin to make a stand. Anna Hazare went on a hunger strike creating a mass movement against bribery. Now there are websites such as ipaidabribe.com popping up to shine a spotlight on corruption.<a href="/print/17870#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The change is the first step in the fight against corruption.</p><p><a href="/print/17870#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Campion, Mukti Jain, ‘Bribery in India: A website for whistleblowers’, <em>BBC News</em>, 6 June 2011, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13616123">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13616123</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>"Survival" corruption, practised by public servants, is usually the result of small salaries, perhaps in highly inflationary economies, which do not allow them to make a living. Such as with the junior police officers mentioned in the previous point. Without bribery, public administration would collapse altogether as no one would have any incentive to get anything done. Thus the level of corruption is determined by the poor economic situation of the country as well as by the policy of the government.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Bribery is often inevitable for foreign companies that invest in those countries, where corruption is widespread and the conditions for business development are unfavourable. In Russia IKEA, the Swedish furniture company, was asked to pay bribes to get electricity for its stores and refused hiring generators instead, however the generators themselves had their price inflated, as a result IKEA suspended investment in Russia.<a href="/print/17870#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It illustrates that bribe giving is just a result of political system with weak democratic traditions.

                    <p>The developed world also carries part of responsibility for the situation in the developing world due to its role as the bribe-payer. After all, it is largely multinational corporate interests that supply the bribe payments. They defraud the citizens of developing countries who get a less good deal as a result, as well as the interests of shareholders at home whose money is diverted into the pockets of foreign officials. This shows the necessity of treating the bribing of foreign officials as a criminal offence in companies’ home countries. It also requires the publication of all payments relating to foreign deals.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Norms and values differ between countries. In many non-western societies gift taking and giving in the public realm is a matter of traditions and customs. Moreover, gift giving is a part of negotiations and relationship building in some parts of the world. It is hypocritical for the west to target developing countries for this as many so-called democracies are hopelessly compromised by business interests through political funding and lobbying.</p><p>The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act bans large bribes but allows for the payment of small ‘customary’ sums in order to ease transactions.<a href="/print/17870#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17870#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> The Economist, ‘When a bribe is merely facilitating business’ June 11<sup>th</sup> 2011, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2011/06/anti-bribery-laws">http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2011/06/anti-bribery-laws</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Corruption is the misuse of power for financial gain.&nbsp; It takes the core harm from unequal distribution of wealth and the resulting disparity in availability of goods and services and&nbsp; magnifies it by including access to just and nominally public services.&nbsp; It must always disproportionately harm the least well off in society either by denying them what is theirs by right or by forcing them into financial hardship to obtain it.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Corruption is not always wrong – it can sometimes be a reaction to greater injustice.&nbsp; For example, the Mafia arose in 19th Century Southern Italy as a mediating institution for an ‘in group’ facing autocratic tyranny.&nbsp; Outsiders are treated badly, but then most groups of people that we label as legitimate also treat outsiders differently to their members.</p>        </div>

                    <p>International standards on prosecution of companies who bribe foreign officials may encourage positive changes in national legislation as well, thus eliminating legal flaws to combat corruption.

                    <p>Foreign companies simply adapt to the political and economic conditions that exist in different countries. You cannot blame them for high level of corruption, which is the inner problem of the state. Involvement of business representatives in anti-corruption actions may contradict their interests by providing access to commercially sensitive information. If bribery was banned, companies would be unable to operate, resulting in less investment and so less development in some countries.</p>        </div>
