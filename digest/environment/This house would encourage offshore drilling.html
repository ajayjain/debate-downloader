    <h1 class="print-title">This house would encourage offshore drilling</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Offshore drilling is an extremely contentious topic in the national discourse. Due to concerns over the environmental impact of offshore oil extraction, a moratorium on offshore drilling was passed in 1981 and Congress has renewed it every year since. However, in 2010 President Obama lifted the moratorium on offshore drilling. Rising gas (petroleum) prices and increasing political pressure, especially from Republicans in oil-rich states such as Alaska&#39;s Sarah Palin, have generated intense debate about lifting the moratorium. Generally the proponents argue for the economic and energy benefits, and the opponents are most concerned about the environmental detriments. In April 2010 caused a massive oil leak from a deep-water oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico operated by BP. The leak poured out oil for four months, becoming the worst such disaster in US history, and inflicting massive environmental damage and economic harm upon Gulf states such as Louisiana and Alabama. One natural consequence was renewed concern about the wisdom of more offshore drilling and calls for much tighter regulation of existing oil wells.</p>

                    <p>Obviously, renewable energy sources must be developed and the way Americans consume energy must be addressed, but that is no reason to ignore an effective part of the solution. Considering the amount of oil that the US currently consumes, 19 million barrels a day, it is both unreasonable and na&iuml;ve to believe that the US will quit using oil overnight. Oil will need to be phased out slowly, but until then, the US will continue to consume and demand oil. The cost of oil is placing a serious strain on the US economy and on individual household budgets, and every available strategy should be used to combat the problem<em>. </em></p>

                    <p>Offshore drilling is a Band-Aid solution to a more fundamental problem. Oil is a finite resource. The reality is that the United States consumes energy at rates far greater than the growth in supply. Such consumption is not sustainable and must be addressed. Offshore drilling only makes a tiny contribution to the problem of supply, while ignoring the more fundamental problem of US demand. Opening America&#39;s coastal waters to offshore drilling only reinforces this misconception and will continue to kick the can down the road instead of gathering support for the long term solutions of renewable energy.</p>

                    <p>In 2008, the government leased 44 million acres offshore, only 10.5 million of which were producing gas. Additionally, there were 4,000 undeveloped leases<sup>1</sup>. The oil industry isn&#39;t even interested in offshore drilling. We likely can&#39;t refine the oil that we would extract, because already oil refineries are stretched thin, and Exxon itself has stated that building a new refinery would not be beneficial for long term profits<sup>2</sup>. Oil wouldn&#39;t be able to be extracted for another 5 years after starting to develop the necessary resources. Drilling ships were booked for the next 5 years in 2008, and oil companies just don&#39;t have the money to spend on the equipment<sup>3</sup>. There are many details that make it unwise to invest in offshore drilling considering the costs.</p>

                    <p>The environmental consequences of offshore drilling are not worth the potential financial gain. The Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 shows how devastating a massive oil leak can be, with fish, marine mammals and seabirds all killed in huge numbers by a slick extending across hundreds of square miles. And as the oil reached the shore it polluted and destroyed valuable coastal wetlands and beaches, dooming the animals that rely upon these habitats<sup>1</sup>. And this leak was well out to sea&ndash; an inshore well would be so much nearer the coast that any leak could have a devastating environmental impact before the authorities could react to defend the coastline. Even without a catastrophic failure such as this, oil rigs release chemicals in the surrounding waters; transporting oil from these rigs has resulted in serious environmental disasters; seismic waves disorientate sea animals; and installing rigs erodes the ocean floor, which makes the impact of hurricanes and tropical storms even worse<sup>1</sup>. Safety estimates are largely overstated, as they do not reflect the magnitude of individual catastrophes, such as the 2010 Gulf disaster or the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989. We cannot assume that disasters like the 2010 Gulf of Mexico blow out are one-offs. The economic costs are also enormous. Fishing and tourism are the economic mainstays of coastal communities and both can be shut down for years by a major oil spill, with hundreds of thousands of people left unemployed<sup>2</sup>. BP has promised to put aside money to compensate those directly affected by the loss of coastal jobs, but what if BP, or a future polluter went bankrupt and was unable to pay out? And even if oil companies do pay up, shutting down coastal industries has huge indirect effects on suppliers, retailers, transport firms, etc. which will damage the wider economy and make all of us poorer.</p>

                    <p>Offshore drilling can be accomplished with minimal damage to the environment. Technology has improved greatly over the past ten years, leading to safer means of construction and production<a href="/print/17693#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. While environmental disasters do occur, they are few and far between. In fact, the EIA considers offshore drilling to be 99.999% safe<a href="/print/17693#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. The 2010 Gulf oil leak was so hard to cap because it was in deep waters; an offshore coastal rig in shallower waters would be much easier to deal with should the worst happen. The 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill was terrible, but it would be wrong to assume that all drilling is equally risky. In the long run, the disaster has done so much damage to BP &ndash; in terms of money, BP set aside $32 billion, reputation and political fallout &ndash; that no firm will take risks when drilling offshore in the future<a href="/print/17693#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. Lessons have already been learnt about how to avoid future offshore spills, as well as how to deal swiftly and effectively with any spills that do occur.</p>

                    <p>The US doesn&#39;t have enough oil to quench demand, so it is a waste of time to attempt to invest in offshore drilling when it is unknown whether there are enough refineries to process the oil, and just how much oil can be extracted. Instead, attention needs to be directed towards alternative energy. Currently, only 8% of US energy is renewable, the rest is oil, coal and natural gas<sup>1</sup>. The US has fallen to the third in the world for clean energy investment. While that may seem like an achievement, billions of more dollars in investment, and even more in incentives need to be put in place to transition the US to renewable energy<sup>2</sup>. This will not only take money but political and social will. Increasing offshore drilling only kicks the can down the road for a while longer, versus actually handling the energy problems that the US is facing.</p>

                    <p>The opposition concedes that the US would require time to transition. As part of the energy solution, offshore drilling should be considered as an energy source to tide the US over as it attempts to develop renewable energy sources. Offshore drilling can provide the necessary oil for the US to begin to transition considering major changes like energy resources cannot happen overnight.</p>

                    <p>Offshore drilling will lower gas (petroleum) prices. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that offshore drilling could generate 18 billion barrels of crude oil<sup>1</sup>. While it consumes 18,771,400 barrels of oil every day<sup>2</sup>. The US consumes huge amounts of oil, and therefore needs to produce more. Greater availability of domestic oil will result in lower gas prices for American consumers. The ban has prevented the US from taking advantage of this known resource. Considering how oil is used in various aspects of American life and industry, high gas prices contribute to economic health. In 2011, gas prices are $4 a gallon and it is thought that these high gas prices jeopardize the economic recovery. Lowering gas prices is therefore essential to improved economic outlook, and therefore offshore drilling should be considered as a viable option.</p>

                    <p>The impact of drilling on oil prices will be minimal and will take years to be felt by US consumers. Oil prices are largely set by worldwide supply and demand, with recent rises reflecting increasing energy use in rapidly growing economies such as China. The amount of oil generated from offshore drilling in the US will not impact world oil markets in any significant way<sup>1</sup>. Additionally, scientists do not know with any certainty how much oil can actually be extracted. Furthermore, oil exploration and rig construction take many years to complete. According to the EIA, offshore drilling would not produce any measurable change in oil prices until 2030.</p>

                    <p>Regulation will never be able to remove the risk from a hugely dangerous activity such as offshore drilling. It is now widely accepted that regulation of the oil industry has been weak, with politicians bought off by the petro-dollars poured into lobbying, and regulators such as the US Minerals Management Service too close to the industry they were meant to be overseeing. In fact Minerals Management says that it will take years for them to create a robust regulatory presence<sup>1</sup>. An investigation into the Deepwater Horizons gulf spill reveals that it occurred due to entirely preventable breakdowns caused by inadequate regulation. The White House report explains, &quot;The well blew out because a number of separate risk factors, oversights, and outright mistakes combined to overwhelm the safeguards meant to prevent just such an event from happening.&quot;<sup>2</sup> The government wants tax revenue, and corporate interests donate to campaigns making it enticing for the regulatory arm of the government to go easy on the oil companies. Easy fixes are set aside for profits, and nothing can change that. The Deepwater Horizon accident was not inevitable. It cost 11 people&#39;s lives, wildlife, and billions of dollars and there is no justifying that a few years of oil is worth the major costs. Due to profit seeking behavior and the sway of the oil companies in Congress, it is unlikely that regulation will ever be up to par. Even after regulatory reform has been instituted, the regulation of the off shore drilling has not made the industry safe<sup>3</sup>. Once the immediate focus on the crisis in the Gulf of Mexico dies away, such pressures are likely to resume, weakening any attempt to improve regulation of offshore drilling.</p>

                    <p>Offshore waters are not a free-for-all, state and federal regulations are in place to monitor and penalize any environmental pollution. If these are found to have been too weak, rules can be tightened to ensure that disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon spill never happen again. Rules have been tightened that will increase the price of operating deep water rigs by $1.4 million and $90,000 for shallow water rigs<sup>1</sup>. Clearly the government is no longer feeding the corruption of the regulation.</p>

                    <p>Even in prosperous economic times, providing jobs and stable growth should be at the forefront of policy maker&#39;s minds. Having more money in the government&#39;s coffers also never hurts considering that keeping a balanced budget is extremely difficult. Turning down an industry that could promote jobs and tax revenue is therefore unwise, particularly when there are ways to make it safe. 2011 has proven to be one of the harshest American job markets since the 1970s. For that reason, cutting jobs and turning away tax revenue needlessly cannot be justified. It is estimated that the slow permit process for offshore drilling has cost the Gulf area 230,000 jobs and $44 billion including tax revenue<sup>1</sup>. Since the offshore drilling industry creates jobs and tax revenue--and can be executed without jeopardizing the environment&mdash;then it is a viable option for investment and should be pursued.</p>

                    <p>Drilling will decrease US dependency on foreign oil and will make America safer. Currently the United States must buy most of its oil from authoritarian and often hostile states such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran, or from unstable places like Nigeria. 22% of US oil comes from the Middle East, 22% from Africa, and 19% from Latin America<sup>1</sup>. It is estimated that the oil in offshore reserves could supply US energy needs for two years. When problems occur in these unstable energy producing countries, it often causes oil prices to rise, and the US has no way of avoiding these consequences. Oil prices increased when the crisis in Libya ensued<sup>2</sup>. Additionally, the US loses leverage over many international actors as its hands are tied due to dependence on oil, this is the case with nuclear proliferation in Iran for example. Offshore drilling and increased energy independence could help distance America from anti-democratic regimes and the impact of unrest in these unstable nations.</p>

                    <p>Offshore drilling will not make the US safer or more energy independent. While America only has 3% of the world&#39;s oil reserves, it consumes 19% of the global oil supply. The US doesn&#39;t have enough oil to meet its demand. Even if the EIA estimates are correct, offshore reserves will have little impact and the US will have to continue buying oil from potentially unfriendly nations for years to come. The only path to true energy independence and greater national security is to decrease American energy consumption and to invest in homegrown renewable energy.</p>
