    <div class="print-content"><p>Climate change and global warming are the result of massive emissions of ‘greenhouse gases’ such as CO2, CFCs<a href="/print/17834#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> and nitrous oxide.<a href="/print/17834#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This has been a problem due to the exponential increase in the burning of fossil fuels throughout the industrial revolution which began in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Climate change is a phenomenon which will have a global impact, although of course nations will be affected to different degrees. Although the problem is a global one, developed nations who are heavily industrialised usually release more greenhouse gases per capita than developing ones. In attempting to address and solve global warming, many have asked whether developed nations - which led the industrial revolution and are responsible for most of the greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere - should bear a greater responsibility for combating climate change.</p><p>This debate has been stimulated in large part by the Kyoto Protocol signed in 1992, which exempted developing nations such as China and India, from the same emissions-reductions obligations as developed countries. The principle underlying Kyoto is known as "common but differentiated responsibilities",<a href="/print/17834#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> which continues as a centerpiece principle for those calling on Developed countries to assume a greater responsibility. China, India, and other developing countries call for recognition of this principle, while many developed countries argue that conditions have changed as developing countries have begun to industrialize and pollute more rapidly in recent years. There are many questions involved in this public debate. The question of who should bear the burden of cutting emissions in order to prevent climate change has been a central reason for there being no new major binding agreement along similar lines to the original Kyoto treaty. The United Nations Climate Change Conferences at Copenhagen and Cancun did not live up to their billing and did not result in a renewal of Kyoto or the creation of a replacement with agreements being in more minor areas such as creating a ‘Green Climate Fund’ at Cancun. The most recent United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban was slightly more successful with agreement that Kyoto would continue until a new agreement is finalized although not all original parties to the agreement are willing to sign up, Canada for example has left the treaty.<a href="/print/17834#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> More importantly there was agreement on the ‘Durban Platform’ from developing countries like China and India that they will be a part of a legally binding treaty to be negotiated by 2015.<a href="/print/17834#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> This therefore opens the door to developing countries taking more responsibility to combat climate change.</p><p><a href="/print/17834#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Baker, M., ‘Is there a connection between the ozone hole and global warming’, <em>Union of Concerned Scientists</em>, 13 July 2009, <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/ozone-hole-and-gw-faq.html" title="http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/ozone-hole-and-gw-faq.html">http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/ozone-h...</a></p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17834#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Sandbach, Lucy, ‘Nitrogen – The Bad Guy of Global Warming’, <em>nakedscientists.com</em>, March 2007, <a href="http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/articles/article/nitrogenthebadguyofglobalwarming1160583306/" title="http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/articles/article/nitrogenthebadguyofglobalwarming1160583306/">http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/articles/article/nitrogenthebadgu...</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17834#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> United Nations, ‘Article 3 Principles’, Full text of the convention, <em>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</em>, <a href="http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1355.php" title="http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1355.php">http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1355.php</a></p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17834#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> CBC News, ‘Canada pulls out of Kyoto Protocol’, 12 December 20111, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/12/12/pol-kent-kyoto-pullout.html" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/12/12/pol-kent-kyoto-pullout.html">http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/12/12/pol-kent-kyoto-pullout....</a></p></div><div id="ftn5"><p><a href="/print/17834#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> Tollefson, Jeff, ‘Durban maps path to climate treaty’, <em>Nature</em>, Vol. 480, Issue 7377, 13 December 2011, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/durban-maps-path-to-climate-treaty-1.9635" title="http://www.nature.com/news/durban-maps-path-to-climate-treaty-1.9635">http://www.nature.com/news/durban-maps-path-to-climate-treaty-1.9635</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

More importantly it is these developed countries that have the research capabilities to come up with the necessary technology to make the economy greener, to produce renewable energy, to mitigate against the effects of disasters. Moreover these same places are the countries that have the finance available to fund these activities; not only funding the research into the solutions but also the financial resources to put them into action all around the world. Poor countries turn to the powerful financial centres such as London and New York to finance large projects, the same will be the case with projects to mitigate climate change. Finally these countries have the expertise to put these new inventions and projects into practice; they have the experts to work out the best places to build, to advise on building, and make sure the project does not have unintended side effects. As the nations with the greatest capability, developed nations have an increased responsibility to act.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The most developed nations are also the most powerful in the international community; they have a duty to lead by example. Even if India and China are rapidly rising the developed countries between them are still the most powerful economies. If developing nations perceive that more developed ones are not acting to combat climate change, they will have no imperative to act. This is because some developing countries such as China or India want to maximize their development capacity in order to compete with developed countries. They are only likely to cut carbon emissions if those developed nations they compete with do so first – that way their attempt to compete is not jeopardised. The climate change talks that have achieved relatively little have shown this to be the case – China has only shown willing to do a deal if the United States commits itself first.</p>        </div>

These countries would be a better example to other developing countries as the methods they use to tackle climate change would be directly applicable to other developing nations whereas action by developed nations is much more likely to take advantage of high tech solutions that may not be universally applicable.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is through heavy industrialisation that developed countries are developed – since they contributed more to climate change, they have a greater obligation to resolve it. Climate change has largely been caused by long-term emissions by developed countries. While China is now the world’s biggest CO2 emitter and other developing countries emissions are rapidly rising historically the vast majority of emissions have been from developed nations. From 1900 to 2004 the United States produced 314,772 million metric tonnes of CO2 compared to China’s 89,243 million metric tonnes and while India now produces more CO2 Germany over the same period emitted three times as much.<a href="/print/17834#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> As CO2 can remain in the atmosphere for a long time, about 50% will be removed within 30 years, but 20% or more may remain for thousands of years, the history of emissions is as relevant as current emissions.<a href="/print/17834#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Since they contribute more of the damage, and since each nation has a responsibility for the harm it has caused, developed nations have an increased obligation to combat climate change.</p><p><a href="/print/17834#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Vaughn, Adam, ‘A history of CO2 emissions’, <em>Datablog guardian.co.uk</em>, 2 September 2009, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/co2-emissions-historical" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/co2-emissions-historical">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/co2-emissions...</a></p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17834#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Inman, Mason, ‘Carbon is forever’, <em>Nature Reports Climate Change</em>, 20 November 2008, <a href="http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0812/full/climate.2008.122.html" title="http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0812/full/climate.2008.122.html">http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0812/full/climate.2008.122.html</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It was unknown that emitting greenhouse gases caused climate change until the 1980s – over a century after the industrial revolution. Developing nations were not initially aware of the damage they were causing, therefore the harm was unintentional. It is unfair to retrospectively punish these nations for something that was unknown to be harmful when it was done. The responsibility should therefore be based upon either current emissions or at most emissions from the period in which the damage caused was known and emissions could have been reduced.</p>        </div>

Countries with large endowments of oil for example are profligate in its use so Qatar emitted 49.1 tons per capita. While China’s emissions of 5.3 tones is much less than the United States there are other developed countries that produce similar amounts such as Switzerland at 5.3 and Israel at 5.2 tons per capita.

                    <p>The world today is globalized and interlinked. It is not economically viable to expect developed nations to use more of their resources to combat global warming. The global economy depends on wealthy developed countries because it is them which create the high demand for the work performed by developing nations allowing countries like china to develop based upon exports. Just as the economic system is global as is pollution. There is no point in a developed country cutting its emissions in half if a developing nation replaces all those emissions and more. &nbsp;For example China’s emissions are expected to rise to between 9.7billion and 12 billion metric tons<a href="/print/17834#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> up from 2008’s 7billion.<a href="/print/17834#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The European Union emits 4.2 billion metric tons so China could easily offset EU emissions losses even if the EU makes very extensive cuts.<a href="/print/17834#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> With the world being so linked the responsibility is equally linked it is therefore not for individual nations or even a particular group of nations to be considered to have a higher obligation but all nations are equally obligated to prevent climate change.</p><p><a href="/print/17834#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Chao, Julie, ‘A Surprise: China’s Energy Consumption Will Stabilize’, <em>Berkeley Lab</em>, 27 April 2011, <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2011/04/27/china-energy-consumption-will-stabilize/" title="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2011/04/27/china-energy-consumption-will-stabilize/">http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2011/04/27/china-energy-consumpt...</a></p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17834#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> United Nations Statistics Division, ‘Carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), thousand metric tons of CO2 (CDIAC)’, <em>Millennium Development Goals Indicators</em>, <a href="http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=749&amp;crid=" title="http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=749&amp;crid=">http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=749&amp;crid=</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17834#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Wikipedia, ‘List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions’, <em>en.wikipedia.org, </em>accessed 20 February 2012</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The very fact that pollution emissions from one country affect everywhere is what makes it possible for one country to be more responsible than another. Countries that have contributed more of the pollution to the global commons than their fair share should be obliged to clean up that global commons. While rich nations reductions might be offset by developing countries increases in the short term in the long run developing nations will need to reduce their emissions in exactly the same way. They simply need more time and can take advantage of not being responsible for the current pollution.</p>        </div>
