    <div class="print-content"><p>Forests around the world are quickly shrinking as a result of illegal or unregulated deforestation. Rainforests once covered 14% of the earth&#39;s land surface, but they now cover a mere 6% and experts estimate that the last remaining rainforests could be consumed in less than 40 years: one and one-half acres of rainforest are lost every&nbsp;second<a href="/print/17705#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Deforestation affects developed and developing countries alike, but the problem is particularly acute in South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia. For governments, forests represent untapped resources. In addition to the financial gains from commercial logging, forests are safety-valves for overpopulation and landlessness. In Africa and South America, wood is used as fuel.</p>
<p>Environmentalists argue that governments should outright ban logging. In North America, there have been violent clashes between logging companies and conservationists. In the 1990s, the World Bank stopped lending to logging companies after lobbying by environmental NGOs. Today the Bank will lend to companies that practice &quot;sustainable harvesting&quot;, promoting low-impact logging and &quot;sustainable use&quot;. More recently, forestry has become a major part of attempts to tackle global climate change, with Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) initiatives agreed at Copenhagen in 2009 and Cancun in 2010 that may result in developing countries being paid by developed nations to protect their forests for the global good.</p>

                    <p>Turning rainforests into farmland is counterproductive. Rainforest cultivation only produces appropriate growing conditions for a short time because the soil is exhausted by the time it has produced three or four crops. The intense daily rainfall that characterises tropical environments also bleaches many of the nutrients from the soil once the protective canopy has been removed by deforestation and the soil is exposed. Hence farmers must constantly fell more areas in order to continue their operations by migrating to a different location<a href="/print/17705#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p><p>Developing countries must instead place their emphasis on more efficient farming methods. This type of farming is not a sustainable industry on which to base a stable economy. More intensive farming technology can help, by reducing the amount of land that poor families need to reclaim from forests to feed themselves. In parts of the Brazilian Amazon, where smallholders’ farming techniques are still very basic, a local environmental group has helped reduce forest loss in one community by getting farmers to adopt a few simple improvements, such as planting their crops in rows rather than scattering seeds, using hoes for weeding and using fertiliser<a href="/print/17705#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Rainforests are productive in other ways; there are other places in the world where we can grow food; we cannot simply relocate a rainforest to somewhere that is more convenient.</p><p><a href="/print/17705#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp;<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/158032">‘Stumped by Trees’, <em>The Economist </em>19<sup>th</sup> March 1998</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17705#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://http://www.economist.com/node/158032">‘Stumped by Trees’, <em>The Economist </em>19<sup>th</sup> March 1998</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The rainforest is not being deforested without reason. Many farmers destroy the rainforest at subsistence level so that they can live, and many more are simply using the land so that they can produce more food to meet the demands of an expanding world&nbsp;population<a href="/print/17705#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. With climate change many areas of the world will become less productive in their food production so new areas need to be found. Rainforests offer unique environments for <strong>commercial farming, </strong><strong>f</strong>or example, <strong>plantation agriculture</strong> such as rubber plantation and oil palm plantations in West Malaysia, and <strong>commercial livestock ranching and beef-cattle brazing</strong> which is practised in Amazon Basin in Brazil. It is true that rainforests should not unsustainably use their resources in pursuit of short-term profit, but it is difficult to argue the priority of biodiversity when countries are so poor.</p><p>Rainforests are also deforested in order to make room for other eco-friendly and renewable energy sources which benefit the world. For example, Indonesia and Malaysia provide 86% of the world's biofuel supply, the market of which is estimated to be around of €33bn, with a double digit annual growth rate<a href="/print/17705#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.

                    <p>Rainforests are responsible for 28% of the world's oxygen turnover<sup>1</sup>, which is why they have been labelled the 'Lungs of the Earth'. Their role in maintaining breathable air is vital as the world population continues to increase exponentially. The rainforests are also a key carbon sink; they are thought to limit the greenhouse effect of global warming by absorbing and storing carbon, hence reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere<sup>2</sup>. Rainforests help to offset global carbon emissions. "To get an idea of the value of the sink, the removal of nearly five billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by intact tropical forest, based on realistic prices for a tonne of carbon, should be valued at around 13 billion pounds per year. This is a compelling argument for conserving tropical forests"<sup>3</sup>.<br>In addition, it has been calculated that 12%-14% of global carbon emissions come from the deforestation of rainforests in countries such as Brazil and Indonesia<sup>4</sup>.<br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://trendsupdates.com/killer-inhabitants-of-the-rainforests/"> 'Killer Inhabitants of the Rainforests' by GSerrano, 4th January 2009</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span><br><sup>2</sup><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3499500.stm"> 'Amazon carbon sink effect "slows"', BBC 10th March 2004</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span><br><sup>3</sup><a href="http://en.cop15.dk/news/view+news?newsid=758"> 'Climate and Energy: COP15 Copenhagen 2009'</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span><br><sup>4</sup><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/08/redd-deforestation-carbon-trading "> 'Seeing Redd in Cancun' by Simon Counsell, The Guardian 8th December 2010</a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>To encourage countries to invest in protecting rainforests international bodies are offering countries 'carbon credits'. The US is proposing to spend $25bn on protecting rainforests. However the proposal is based upon carbon credits, allowing investors to earn carbon-emission credits in return for saving trees. This means that for however much they invest into protecting the rainforest, they will be allowed to emit around one tonne of carbon dioxide. A ban on deforestation may in the end be counterproductive. "Awarding tradable credits to countries that reduce deforestation will cause carbon prices to plummet worldwide and may make global warming worse by pulling investors away from renewable energy, an economic study found"<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Besides, to claim that rainforests are the answer to climate change is to claim complete understanding of global phenomenon that we really know nothing about. Warmer Atlantic waters in 2005 actually turned the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, into a net emitter of CO2 when it is normally a carbon sink<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a1Vb6ldbVoO0"> 'Rain Forest-saving credits may cut carbon emission prices', by Alex Morales and Jeremy van Loon, Bloomberg 30th March 2009</a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>A ban on unsustainable logging is possible by creating sustainable alternatives. Regulation can protect forests. In the U.S., the State of California, the federal government and Pacific Lumber Company reached agreement to protect the Headwaters forest. The agreement bans logging in certain areas so as to protect Headwaters' eco-system. Pacific Lumber can log 425,000 cubic metres in specially-protected buffer zones<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Where sustainable logging is difficult Governments should find alternatives to logging wilderness forests, including alternative fuel sources and genetically engineered trees. In Africa, poverty is the main source for deforestation. Poor people cannot afford alternatives fuels and must fell trees to make fire. By prohibiting logging, governments will create an incentive for the development of alternative fuel sources. Scientists are developing genetically engineered trees. They either grow faster or have improved quality wood. The biggest obstacle to full-scale development of genetically engineered trees is public opinion and money<sup>2</sup>. Logging companies and governments have no incentive to invest in research and development of these trees as long a virgin forests remain.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/188245"> 'The redwood forests, Saved at a price' The Economist 4th March 1999</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span><br><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthcomment/3349953/Why-we-need-GM-trees.html"> 'Why we need GM trees' The Telegraph, 20th August 2008, by Graham Mole</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Deforestation is often used as a tool for leverage in politics. Frequently this involves collusion between the exploiters and government or the bribery of officials responsible for enforcement of conservation regulations or for the protection of reserves. Corruption often begins at high levels and continues all the way down the government hierarchy. Even if corruption is not outright in terms of bribes, logging companies may seek concessions, low fees and taxes, or the waiving of international regulations in return for offering governments a percentage of the revenues from the sale of the wood. Governments then use the revenues gained from this deforestation for political gain, either through feeding some of it back into society or by providing the newly created land to landless migrants. In a more sinister example, logging was used by the Khmer Rouge to fund its civil war in Cambodia<sup>1</sup>. Governments in tropical countries often feel that exploitation of natural resources is an opportunity for economic gain. For instance, in the 1980?s, Malaysia, Indonesia and The Philippines exported 85 million cubic meters of wood (4% of the global wood supply), worth about $3 billion<sup>2</sup>, which has since grown to be one of their main industries. This gives the government credibility as an economic force for good, though the sacrifice is sustainability and a condoning (even encouraging) of illegal logging. And an indefinable amount of the profits are siphoned off into the private funds of some government officials, unbeknownst to the population.</p><p><sup>1</sup> As a result, since the 1970s, around half of Cambodia's forests have disappeared. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/158032"> 'Stumped by Trees', The Economist 19th March 1998</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.rainforestconservation.org/rainforest-primer/3-rainforests-in-peril-deforestation/d-causes-of-tropical-rainforest-destruction/18-economic-attitudes "> Rainforest Conservation Fund: Economic Attitudes</a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Local indigenous people rely on areas of the tropical rainforests for their homes, provision for food, fuel and small-scale subsistence farming. The Amazon rainforest is the ancestral home of one million people and contains 400 human tribes, many of whom have never had contact with the outside world<sup>1</sup>; they eat many plant foods such as oranges, yams and bananas, and bushmeats such as wild pigs. Their traditional small-scale slash and burn farming techniques and hunting cause about the same amount of damage to the rainforest as a tree falling and the plants are allowed enough time that they can easily re-colonise. Similarly, there are 15 un-contacted tribes in the Peruvian Amazon, but their ancient way of life is under threat because more than 70% of the Peruvian rainforest has been leased to oil companies for exploration<sup>2</sup>. In the past, oil exploration has led to violent and disastrous contact with isolated Indians. In the early 1980s, exploration by Shell led to contact with the isolated Nahua tribe; within a few years more than 50% of the Nahua had died<sup>2</sup>. In 1996 illegal loggers forced contact with the Murunahua Indians. In the following years over 50% of them died, mainly from colds, flu and other respiratory infections<sup>2</sup>.<br>These small tribes cannot adapt to life outside the rainforest and will die out, taking with them ancient ways of life. They could have valuable lessons to teach us about how to utilise ecosystems by working in harmony with them.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/amazontribes"> Survival, The movement for tribal peoples: Background Briefing, The Amazon</a> <span class="print-footnote">[13]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/isolatedperu#main"> 'The Un-contacted Indians of Peru'</a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span></p>        </div>

Tribes must learn to adapt to an expanding and urbanising world.</p><p>Further, the diaspora of the tribes may be a necessary sacrifice in the balancing of densely populated countries whose populations are expanding. In the Mau forest in Kenya, illegal settlement and deforestation have destroyed 24%, or 107,000 hectares (264,000 acres), of its trees over 20 years; forty years ago, forests covered 12% of Kenya, but now it is just 1.7%<sup>2</sup>. The forest settlers, many of whom were sold false title deeds, reject the government's position that they have no right to the land and many are fearful about where they will live now. The government adopts the stance that any land given out illegally must be returned to the government. They dispersed the Ogeik people, an indigenous tribe, to make room for the majority Kalenjin. In Brazil and Indonesia, there are programs deliberately promoting migration from heavily populated urban centres to deforested areas; in Brazil settlers from the coast are immediately granted the rights to whatever land they deforest. Without this migration, Bali, Java and Brazil's coastal areas would become unbearably overpopulated.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jun/26/amazon-land-rights-brazil"> Brazil grants land rights to squatters living in Amazon rainforest', by Tom Phillips, The Guardian 26th June 2009</a> <span class="print-footnote">[15]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/19/us-kenya-forest-idUSTRE5AI21D20091119 "> 'Kenya evicts squatters from vital Mau forest' by Daniel Wallis, Reuters 19th November 2009</a> <span class="print-footnote">[16]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Deforestation has long-term environmental impacts. There is a causal connection between deforestation, loss of biodiversity and climate change. Rainforests are the most diverse habitats on earth; they cover only 6% of the land surface of the world but scientists estimate they have over 50% of the earth's plants and animals<sup>1</sup>. Experts estimate that we are losing 137 plant, animal and insect species every single day due to rainforest deforestation: that equates to 50,000 species a year<sup>2</sup>.<br>Moreover rainforests are not unproductive habitats. Not only are they aesthetically pleasing, they are also socially and economically important. They have many plants that are used in medicines. For example, the US National Cancer Institute has identified 3000 plants that are active against cancer cells; 70% of these plants are found in the rainforest<sup>2</sup>. Indeed, 25% of the active ingredients in today's cancer-fighting drugs come from organisms found only in the rainforest<sup>2</sup>. There are still many plants to be discovered that could further aid medical research. If we lose this biodiversity, we will lose our ability to utilise these species for our own benefit and the benefit of future generations on Earth.<br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/rainforest.htm "> 'Tropical Rainforest' by Michael G, 2002</a> <span class="print-footnote">[17]</span><br><sup>2</sup><a href="http://deforestationintheamazon.wordpress.com/facts/ "> 'Deforestation in the Amazon: Facts' by Ryan Walters</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>        </div>

Indonesia subsidizes its forest industry through high export taxes on unprocessed logs to help the domestic wood-processing industry.

                    <p>The case of rainforests is a unique one. The clean air and water produced by rainforests are not kept exclusively within national borders. The trees from the Amazon, for example, absorb CO2 and help to purify the air for the world as a whole. Thus rainforests differ from national resources such as gold deposits, in that it is a common resource. It benefits all and therefore it should be the responsibility of all. The principle that countries can only develop to the extent that they do not harm other nations was outlined in Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, established in London in 1972, which stipulated that if certain countries condone the dumping of waste into the ocean, other countries may take multilateral action to punish the offending country.

                    <p>Severe legal sanctions are the only possible response to a crisis. Environmentalist campaigns in the 1980s against the World Bank's contribution to forest destruction - through support for commercial logging, road-building through forested areas and mega-dams that flooded large forest areas - led in the early 1990s to a rethink at the Bank.</p><p>In 1991, the Bank published a Forest Policy paper which ended support for commercial logging in primary forests and promised a new Bank approach that would emphasize conservation, poverty reduction and support for the rights of local people. Nearly a decade later, the World Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED, its internal review agency), published a review in November 1999 of the Bank's implementation of its Forest Policy Paper of 1991. The OED report documents that the Bank's performance has been a flop: "Bank influence on containing rates of deforestation in tropical moist forests has been negligible in the 20 countries identified for Bank focus," the report concludes<sup>1</sup>. The OED finds that the World Bank has largely ignored the guidelines provided in the Forest Policy Paper, and that it has paid little attention to the impacts of its loans on forests. A legal dimension is necessary to ensure that international governments, companies and organisations stay committed.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/IMF_WB/WBPoliciesDestroyForests.html"> 'World Bank policies destroy forests', by Karinna Horta, Multinational Monitor magazine, June 2000</a> <span class="print-footnote">[18]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Regulation and legal sanctions without outright bans can protect forests. Under the Pelly Amendment<sup>1</sup>, the US government can impose trade sanctions against countries that hamper multilateral efforts for environmental conservation. Such positive decisiveness by certain regions is certainly capable of adaptation on the global scale. In the US, the State of California, the federal government and Pacific Lumber Company reached an agreement to protect the Headwaters forest<sup>2</sup>. The agreement bans logging in certain areas so as to protect Headwaters' eco-system. Pacific Lumber can log 425,000 cubic metres in specially-protected buffer zones. This model of forest conservation encourages good management and cooperation between government, private business and environmentalists.<br>Such a solution may seem limited, only targeting the reduction of destruction of rainforests. Yet its implications are much more far-reaching, in the sense that it establishes a new attitude towards deforestation and climate change: the international community will not allow quick profits at expense of environment.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.highnorth.no/library/publications/iceland/wh-th-us.htm"> 'Wales, the U.S. Pelly Amendment and international trade law' by Ted L.

                    <p>In 1995, the Brazilian government passed a series of increasingly tough laws on deforestation - first prohibiting landowners from logging more than 50% of their land, then lowering the limit to 20%. Yet satellite data showed that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon in 1995 reached an all-time high of 29,000 square kilometres, an area about the size of Belgium. The figure for 1996 was down, but at 18,100 square kilometres was still substantial. The problem was that existing rules are simply not enforced. Ibama, Brazil's environment agency, has a small number of officials to police a vast region. Last year it collected just 6% of the fines it levied. As a result of the ineffectiveness of this deterrent, the Brazilian government has estimated that 80% of the timber in the region is harvested illegally<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/158032"> 'Stumped by Trees', The Economist 19th March 1998</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p>        </div>
