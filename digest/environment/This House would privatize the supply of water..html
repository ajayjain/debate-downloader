    <h1 class="print-title">This House would privatize the supply of water.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Water is the most common substance on earth and constantly renews itself through evaporation and rainfall. Still, 97% of the world&#39;s water is salt water and thus undrinkable, and the majority of the earth&#39;s freshwater is locked up in ice caps and glaciers, leaving just 1% of the world&#39;s water available for human consumption. This water must not only satisfy domestic use, but also industry and agriculture.</p>
<p>Water is also the most important basic human need. People can go weeks without food, yet only days without water. One in eight, over 884 million, people on earth do not have access to safe drinking water and 3.5 million people die each year from water-related disease<sup>1</sup>. Without tackling these problems, little progress can be made on other development issues. When water is unavailable children are required by the family to collect it from several miles away and cannot attend school. These conditions cause a number of people to grow so sick that they cannot work, and infant mortality rises to very high levels. The United Nation&#39;s International Year of Fresh Water in 2003 focused attention on these issues, and produced commitments to halve the number of people without access to clean water over the next decade. It is estimated that it will take $30 billion dollars to provide safe drinking water to everyone in the world<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>In many countries, governments have failed to champion fresh water access, and so multi-national corporations have moved in and begun providing water to those without it. It is controversial, however, because many cannot afford the water provided by companies. As the globe&#39;s population is only increasing, and more people are demanding water, something needs to be done. This debate centers on whether it is just to privatize water in an effort to address the current drinking water crisis in the international community.</p>

                    <p>A publicly owned water company has a larger stake in the public good, since workers, managers and politicians depend on it working smoothly for society (which includes them). This is not the case with foreign or transnational corporations whose executives and shareholders don't necessarily share the interests of their clients and aren't even personally liable for the damages their decisions may bring on the population. In fact, in many developing countries the government does not have the capacity to effectively regulate private utilities, ensure that their water is affordable and of quality, and create and enforce punishment if companies breach contracts. As for the viability of public projects, previous public, community-level water and sanitation projects, in both rural and urban areas, have a consistent record of success. In fact, according to the World Bank much of the increase in water accessibility thanks to PPPs came from public entities and public funds<sup>1</sup>. The only group that has the necessary incentives to provide all people with water is the government and therefore in an effort to create a world with universal access to water, the government must be held responsible for water provision.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.ppiaf.org/ppiaf/sites/ppiaf.org/files/FINAL-PPPsforUrbanWaterUtilities-PhMarin.pdf">Philippe, Marin (2009), "Public-Private Partnerships for Urban Water Utilities", World Bank, [Accessed July 11, 2011]</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Just because governments have an incentive to provide water to the poor does not mean that they will. The only way to truly respond to the need for water is through a profit-based, innovative system to make it worth companies' time and effort to provide water to the poor. The likelihood that governments will come around and address their poorest people's needs, when the government has very little money to spend, is very slim.

                    <p>Universally providing water is one of the greatest challenges facing the drinking-water crisis. Those without water are overwhelming the world's poor. Providing water to the severely impoverished is not necessarily profitable, which makes it more reasonable for the government to foot the bill. The poor are the demographic that does not have extra money to spend, and it is therefore not always profitable to provide them with water<sup>1</sup>. Large sums are needed to meet global water targets, but the private sector will only provide these in return for large commercial returns, meaning that the true cost of the investment will eventually be much higher than if it were publicly funded. Government and donor investment is preferable to privatization as those bodies can target their investment at the most needy, rather than focusing upon the most profitable opportunities. Water supply is also a natural monopoly, so private companies have no competitive pressures to drive up quality and drive down prices. Even in the developed world, the experience of water privatization is not encouraging: in England shareholders cashed in and much of the industry ended up in foreign hands while prices went up, yet droughts in the 1990s still led to widespread rationing.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://water.org/learn-about-the-water-crisis/facts/">Water.org (2011), "Water Facts", [Accessed July 11, 2011]</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>        </div>

By tapping into the innovation and desire for profit, there is potential that private business could find a profitable way of providing water to the poor since clearly this void is not being filled by governments.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Water would ideally be a universally accessible and affordable substance, but governments cannot necessarily be trusted to provide water to all of their citizens. 90% of water is publicly provided, yet 1 billion people don't have water<sup>1</sup>. Clearly this isn't working. Some governments are negligent, and there needs to be a solution to give citizens access to clean water without government provision. This problem has only been exacerbated by the shrinking budgets of most countries due to the economic crisis of 2009. Current regimes in developing countries often provide a state subsidy to the rich, with water provided to middle-class areas and wealthy farmers at a fraction of its true cost, while poorer areas have no supply at all<sup>2</sup>. Many governments are unfair to the poor, but private providers have no reason to pick favorites. The poor are already paying for their water, either directly to entrepreneurs who carry it in tubs and cans up to the shanty towns, or with their time as they spend a large proportion of the family's labor fetching poor quality water from miles away<sup>3</sup>. Water privatization will charge for water, however it will be more fair to the poor and provide them with more options to accessing water that the government is not providing. It is difficult to force governments to improve water access, but companies and Public-Private Partnerships (where private companies pay for most of the infrastructure, but partner with public entities) can be used to achieve this goal.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/1906828"> Economist (2003), "Private Passions", Economist Magazine, [Accessed July 11, 2011]</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://beta.adb.org/publications/asian-water-supplies-reaching-urban-poor">Asian Water Supplies Chapter 11, "Tariffs, Subsidies, and Development Funding", [Accessed July 11, 2011]</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span><br><sup>3</sup> <a href="http://www.intussen.info/OldSite/Documenten/Noord/Internationaal/WB/PRSP%20Sourcebook/18%20Water,%20sanitation%20and%20poverty.pdf"> Bosch, Christophe, Hommann, Kirsten, Rubio, Gloria M., Sadoff, Claudia and Travers, Lee (2001), "Water, Sanitation and Poverty", Intussen,[Accessed July 11, 2011]</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Governments can be pushed to take action to provide their people with water. Water is such an important part of life that it is unlikely that a government can ignore the issue, if its people do not have access to clean water. The World Bank often ties loans to development in countries including improving water access, and the same stipulations can be associated with aid from individual countries<sup>1</sup>. There are therefore ways of working with governments and it is not necessary to look to private companies to usurp them.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/C4B73FD7CFFEB2C7852567F5005D6604?opendocument">World Bank (2011), "Paraguay - Community Based Rural Water Systems and the Development of Village Committees", World Bank, [Accessed July 11, 2011].</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Water privatization can increase the price of water, and the poor may be entirely unable to afford water. More than 2 in every 3 people who need clean water live on less than $2 a day. Therefore the poor are the largest concern in this debate because they are the ones in need of clean water. India has a public water system, and although water subsidies in India are particularly helpful to the rich, they are also beneficial to the poor farmers who would likely have a very difficult time of buying adequate water to grow their crops<sup>1</sup>. Poor people will opt to walk long distances to streams and rivers to acquire potentially unsafe drinking water if it is too expensive to purchase. Cochabamba is an important example. Encouraged by the World Bank, this area of Bolivia contracted Bechtel to provide their water. Rates went up 100%, people couldn't afford water, and ultimately there were riots that forced the contract to be dissolved and caused chaos in terms of water provision to ensue<sup>2</sup>. Rates rise because private water companies are monopolies and are trying to make as much money as possible. They thus hurt the poor who are most in need of clean water. Privatization is not a viable option for improving water access and quality around the world.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://beta.adb.org/publications/asian-water-supplies-reaching-urban-poor">Asian Water Supplies Chapter 11, "Tariffs, Subsidies, and Development Funding", [Accessed July 11, 2011]</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span> .</p><p><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://water.columbia.edu/files/2011/11/Siegfried2008ThirstyForChange.pdf"> Foshee, Jack, et al.

                    <p>In most countries the poor are already paying for water that is not necessarily clean, and usually very limited in quality. Clearly there is currently a problem that governments are not addressing, and even though people will have to pay for water it is likely that companies will be able to provide better quality water to more people in larger quantities and is therefore entirely justified.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The goal of the United Nations is to provide more people with clean water; it is irrelevant who provides it as long as it becomes available to more of the world's population. Private public partnerships have proven themselves successful in improving water access around the world. The World Bank conducted a study that estimated that since 1990, PPPs have provided piped water to 24 million people<sup>1</sup>. Many public utility companies need to start rationing water because of a lack of service continuity. Most poor areas have low pressure and poor pipe infrastructure, and the people have little money to afford wells and pumps that could address the issues that come with rationing<sup>1</sup>. For this reason the poor are disproportionately affected by rationing. PPPs have been successful in reducing these problems. For example, Colombian private companies have improved service continuity in many cities and towns<sup>1</sup>. Additionally, clean, quality water must be provided to people, because of the potentially serious consequences of unhealthy water. The desire to make a profit drives companies into remote areas and improves water access for the poor and therefore is a viable option for addressing current water concerns.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.ppiaf.org/ppiaf/sites/ppiaf.org/files/FINAL-PPPsforUrbanWaterUtilities-PhMarin.pdf">Philippe, Marin (2009), "Public-Private Partnerships for Urban Water Utilities", World Bank, [Accessed July 11, 2011]</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Companies only serve their shareholders and profits. As a result, if a rural a village only has a handful of poor residents, a supply company will probably not build the necessary infrastructure to provide it with water, because the likelihood of the company receiving a return on their investment is low. Since all people need water, and companies have no incentive to provide water to everyone—only those who pay—privatization does not necessarily improve access to water for those in the direst need.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>As populations are increasing, demand for water is increasing, but the water available is becoming scarcer. For that reason, using water effectively is integral to sustainably improving access to water around the world. Water simply cannot continue to be wasted. Companies want to be profitable and that means operating at the highest efficiency. The World Bank found that, in Western Africa, Brazil, Colombia, Morocco, and Eastern Manila, private companies have successfully reduced water losses. In some cases, private companies have reduced non-revenue water to just 15%, which is comparable to developed countries’ utilities, which are generally very efficient.<sup>1 </sup>It is essential that efficiency is reached, and private companies have been shown to improve efficiency through conserving water resources while public companies generally lose efficiency through wasted water.&nbsp; They have also improved labor productivity since managers are trying to run a profitable company and employees need to be effective. Often public utility companies are wasteful and unproductive, which expends valuable resources and actually reduces the number of people water is being made accessible to. Private companies, on the other hand, have tools and expertise for building effectively, which are often unavailable to governments. For example, companies in the Niger Delta were able to get supplies for a fraction of the price that the government paid<sup>1</sup>. 160 million people have been served by Public-Private projects in the last 15 years and 50 million of them—about one third—are considered successful<sup>1</sup>. Considering the challenges to providing water, a 1/3 success rate is significant and is the foundation for further improvement. Because efficiency lowers the price of water, saves more water to be distributed, and prevents wasting a valuable resource, privatization is a viable solution.</p><div><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.ppiaf.org/ppiaf/sites/ppiaf.org/files/FINAL-PPPsforUrbanWaterUtilities-PhMarin.pdf">Philippe</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span><a href="http://www.ppiaf.org/ppiaf/sites/ppiaf.org/files/FINAL-PPPsforUrbanWaterUtilities-PhMarin.pdf">, Marin (2009), "Public-Private Partnerships for Urban Water Utilities", World Bank, Accessed July 11, 2011.</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span><br>&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Efficiency is not exclusive to private companies and industry. It is not impossible for public utilities to be effective. Both private and public utilities have their drawbacks, but with government oversight and productivity incentives, public utilities can perform with efficiency. This has been proven to be the case, as utilities in many developed countries work just fine. Most Americans are in fact served by publicly owned utilities<sup>1</sup>. Therefore public does not mean inefficient.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/2004/circ1268/htdocs/text-ps.html">U.S. Geological Survey.

                    <p>Water is a resource subject to supply and demand, and so should be treated as an economic good. It may fall freely from the skies, but it has to be collected, managed, processed and supplied through an expensive system of reservoirs, channels, processing plants and pipes. Dirty water and human waste also have to be removed and treated in sanitation systems. We pay for food, and shelter, which are both necessary for life, so it is perfectly morally acceptable to pay for water. Problems of water supply need to be addressed with huge investment, particularly in the developing world where many people have no access to decent fresh water. Even in the developed world, much water (up to 50% in Canada) is wasted through leaks in pipes and ageing infrastructure. The public sector has failed to provide the money for this investment so private involvement is essential. For this investment to be attractive to the private sector, water companies must be allowed to make a profit through realistic water charges that reflect the costs of supply. Issues of quality, equity and environmental standards can be handled through effective regulation.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Yes we do pay for different utilities and necessary resources, however if they are publicly owned, the government can subsidize those costs for low-income citizens who cannot afford the full price. When governments own the utilities that provide water, they can better control the price that the poor have to pay and thus address of affordability. Additionally, just because we pay for other utilities does not justify having to pay for the most necessary resource to life.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Water is a natural resource that ought to be free as it falls from the sky. It is also essential to all life, including humanity. Lack of good water is the biggest single factor in disease and ill health in the developing world, and without it people cannot grow crops to support themselves. Pollution of water sources or over-extraction has a very damaging environmental impact. For all these reasons water is special and should be seen as a common good, part of the responsibility of governments to their people. Access to clean water is a human right, not something to be traded away or withheld on grounds of cost. Something so vital to life cannot be denied to people based on their ability to pay. Essentially, charging for water is charging for life, which is inherently wrong.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Maybe water itself cannot be owned, but water needs to be collected, cleaned, and then funneled to its respective destinations. Infrastructure and labor are necessary for each of those steps to providing clean water. Because it costs money to provide clean water, people also need to pay money so that those costs can be recouped. It is possible to own water provision infrastructure and therefore moral to ask for money in return for the money invested. If water were really free as it falls from the sky, then there would be no water problems in places where it rains. The actual case is that unclean water is free, so people are really paying for the services that provide clean, potable water, not the water itself.</p>        </div>
