    <h1 class="print-title">This House Would Keep the Sabbath as a Day of Rest.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The notion that one day each week should be reserved for activities that are not commercial is historically a religious one but there are supporting arguments from the trade union &nbsp;and other labor rights movements that support the idea for entirely secular reasons. There is also a growing interest in the notion of the democratization of leisure; the notion that rest-time should not be a privilege purely enjoyed by the professional classes.</p><p>Actions taken by the European Union and other bodies to impose a maximum working week have followed in this tradition. The religious teaching on the subject is instructional; Christ’s comment that ‘the Sabbath was made for man not man for the Sabbath’ and the idea of the Sabbath being a day of rest that is ‘sanctified to the Lord’ where originally even everyday activities such as cooking and lighting a fire were banned.<a href="/print/18073#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p>In contrast to this position stands the idea that people should be allowed to earn as much as they choose to – or are required to – and that is nobody else business if someone chooses to work seven days a week.</p><p>The issue is complex on a number of levels; ethically, legally, economically as well as in terms of religion. In much of the West the religious argument is simply a non-starter in an era when everyone expects to be able to go to the supermarket or DIY store at the weekends and respect for the Day of the Lord is anathema. Equally, why pick Sunday? Jews could argue for Saturday, Muslims for Friday and so on. &nbsp;In much of Eastern Asia the seven day week is normative but many economists have questioned whether this is productive, arguing that rest is a valuable contribution to working life – essentially that people are more efficient if they are not constantly focused on work.</p><p>That said there are many professions where constant activity is assumed – politics, academia and the arts, to name a few. In any of these professions, and many others, it would seem odd to compel workers to take a day off. However, for many engaged in routine or repetitive work the possibility for a day of rest may be welcome but the loss of income would not be.</p><p>Broadly speaking the groups in favour of a restriction on Sunday trading fall into two groups. Many of them are Christian organisations such as the UK’s Keep Sunday Special<a href="/print/18073#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> campaign or the Canadian group Save Our Sundays<a href="/print/18073#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a>. However such organisations frequently receive the support of trades union, notably those organising in the retail sector.</p><p>According to an NOP poll conducted in the UK in 2005, 87% of people agreed that it was useful for social cohesion and family stability for there to be one designated day off for all members of society. The argument from many in workers’ rights organisations is that a shared day of rest is a good thing in and off itself and if that happens to coincide with a day of religious observance then so be it. &nbsp;</p><div><a href="/print/18073#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> Inconvenient in cold countries! <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath, New Advent</a><br><div id="edn2"><p><a href="/print/18073#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[ii]</a> <a href="http://www.keepsundayspecial.org.uk/Web/">http://www.keepsundayspecial.org.uk/Web/</a></p></div><div id="edn3"><p><a href="/print/18073#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title="">[iii]</a> <a href="http://saveoursundays.tripod.com/">http://saveoursundays.tripod.com/</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-text field-field-debate-authors">

                    <p>Compelling individuals to take their leisure time on one particular day undermines the entire nature of that right. The whole principle of leisure is that it should not be forced or required, it is that time when the individual is not bound to comply with the dictates of any authority – be that an employer, the state or a religion.</p><p>Leisure should be time taken at the convenience – and to the benefit – of the individual. If the individual choses to use that time for religious observance that is their right but the presumption that a day of religious observance is the best day to take is unfair to the many who do not share those views.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Different cultures have varying traditions of rest. Approaches towards the number of days of vacations taken each year, the length of the working day, which annual festivals should be treated as public holidays, siestas, work levels during Ramadan and so on are all taken on the basis of the culture and history of that particular country. As a result it is not unreasonable for a country with a Christian background to identify Sunday as their designated day of rest.</p><p>The work ethic of any country relates to their history as is reflected in the festivals that are given significance.
