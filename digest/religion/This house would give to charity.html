    <h1 class="print-title">This house would give to charity</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>About 23% of the global population lives in absolute poverty. In developing countries there is a low life expectancy, a high infant mortality rate, high levels of unemployment and illiteracy, nutritional levels below acceptable standards and widespread disease with very little or poor quality medical assistance. Others live incredibly wealthy and luxurious lives and so the wealth is distributed in a very unequal manner. These are the central problems to questions of charity though charity also includes many other areas such as assisting the elderly.</p>
<p>We all applaud when very rich people pledge to give away most of their billions, but they are usually left with millions to pass on, still much more than most people would expect to earn in their lifetime. Even comparatively moderate salaries in the west are very high when compared globally. Someone on &pound;20,000 could easily afford to give away &pound;2,000 per year and still have plenty to live on and some luxuries</p>
<p>Most people agree that giving to charity is morally praiseworthy but charitable behaviour tends to be labelled supererogatory or above and beyond the call of duty. Some argue, however, that charitable behaviour is morally required. This means that to fail to behave charitably would be wrong. The majority of arguments in this vein refer to giving aid to poorer nations but they may also refer to giving time within one&rsquo;s immediate community. Arguments tend to place different requirements on people in different income brackets and exclude entirely people who are merely making ends meet. Some argue that people should all contribute a certain percentage of their earnings. I will group together all those arguments that place a moral requirement on people to give to charity, despite the fact that there is wide disagreement as the extent of that moral requirement.</p>

                    <p>The philosopher Peter Singer proposes what has been called the Greater Moral Evil Rule: If we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable significance, we ought to do it. From this first premise Singer argues that absolute poverty is bad and that there is some absolute poverty we can prevent without sacrificing anything of comparable significance. Therefore, we ought to prevent some absolute poverty. This argument can be modified to cover a large variety of things which one might call 'charity'.</p><p>Singer derives the greater moral evil rule by use of the drowning child analogy. If one walked past a child drowning in a shallow pond it would surely be unethical to walk past that child and allow it to drown simply because you didn't want to be ten minutes late for an appointment or wet your trousers bottoms. In the same way, if one could give up a tiny percentage of one's income to provide a meal for a child who would otherwise starve to death then surely it would be unethical to allow that child to die. Surely then not giving aid is tantamount to murder.</p>        </div>

                    <p>As much as Singer wants us to give. Giving away a huge portion of one's money seems require heroic self-sacrifice. It is also different in that we do not always know whether or not our money will contribute to saving a life. Maybe it will pay for administration or be wasted or fill the pockets of bureaucrats. It is far more callous to kill someone who you can see suffering and who is in your presence. We cannot expect people to have empathy for every human alive. We should only hold people responsible for problems that they helped to cause. Wealthy people did not help to cause poverty and so can't be held responsible for solving it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>By allowing charities to deal with social problems we remove the pressure on government to deal with these problems. Society is less likely to vote a party out of power for failing to address poverty if charities are seen to be alleviating the problem. This is bad a) because governments are best able to solve social problems because they have money and a lot of information b) because we should force governments to properly fulfil their role and to spend taxpayer's money appropriately. Furthermore, we can hold governments accountable when they provide a poor service but we cannot do the same with a charity.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Poverty is such a widespread problem that even though many charities address it there is still a world hunger crisis. People may not be putting enough pressure on governments but this is not because they think the problem is solved- they can see it is not. Rather it is because they are apathetic. It is not necessarily true that governments are best able to solve poverty and other social problems. There is a lot of bureaucracy in government and when the party in power changes policies are discontinuous. Government budgets and structures change frequently again making them discontinuous. NGOs only have to focus on their single goal rather than placing it in amongst other priorities as a government may do. NGOs are very capable of gathering in depth information themselves. Government's role is a controversial question and it is not necessarily clear that they have a duty to solve poverty. Furthermore, often governments are incapable of doing so as a result of debt, lack of resources or war. Even if we did need to place more pressure on governments, surely we need someone to alleviate poverty while we are persuading government to take over that role. We can hold charities accountable by choosing to give our donations to a different one.</p>        </div>

However, it may be the case that in the future you will be in a situation where you do desperately need money e.g. a serious medical condition; a family member needs a lawyer to avoid prison. It is no surprise that the amount given to charity fell 11% in Britain in the year following the recession in 2008<sup>1</sup>. Families need to look after themselves first and foremost, and part of that requires planning for the future. Therefore, it is better to preserve your money for your own needs.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/sep/23/charity-donations-down"> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/sep/23/charity-donations-down" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/sep/23/charity-donations-down">http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/sep/23/charity-donations-down</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span> </a></p>        </div>

                    <p>Many people gain from giving to charity. It improves self-esteem, alleviates guilt, and ensures religious or cultural guidelines that are important to you are met. They also contribute towards tax breaks. Acting in such an ethical manner therefore has numerous effects on other aspects of life. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who has given billions to his own charities, describes giving his money back as making him feel 'very fortunate' and 'thrilled'<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Some philosophers argue that an ethical life is a virtuous life. A virtue is any activity that encourages human flourishing. A virtue tends to be the midpoint of two vices. For example, it would be wrong to be lazy but it would also be wrong to work so hard that one never has time for one's family. Being hardworking is the midpoint of these two extremes and also serves to provide the individual with a sense of fulfilment and the positive consequences that come about as a result of hard work.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/GlobalHealth/story?id=1286093"> http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/GlobalHealth/story?id=1286093</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>There are numerous ways people can feel better about themselves without having to give up money to a charity. Whilst one could give money to a charity that provides support to the poor and disadvantaged, he or she could just as easily use their wealth to start a business or expand a current one, providing jobs that will do a great deal more for the jobless than a package from a charity. Furthermore, the knowledge that one's business has given a job to someone poor and in desperate need of work will do far more for their self-esteem than signing a cheque to a charity. Similarly, sending a cheque when one could, with a bit more effort or courage, create a job would only increase guilt rather than alleviate it.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The wealth gap is strongly correlated to crime. In order to make one's own society safer one ought to give generously to charities that support the poor. In the United States in 2008, 37% of black high-school dropouts were incarcerated; if more money was given to charities that support the poor sectors of society that are the most likely to drop-out, crime rates would inevitably come down. For example, of those black students who did make it to college, only 2% were incarcerated. The pattern is uniform across all races in the United States, the longer they stay in school, and therefore the more chance they have of finding a job, the less chance of ending up in prison<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>The wealthy should also consider the possibility that a wealthy individual can fall on hard times and need charity in the future. By behaving charitably and fostering a culture of generosity one ensures that the community will assist them in the future. Reducing inequality therefore both makes society safer and makes it more likely to help those at the very bottom.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2270328/"> http://www.slate.com/id/2270328/</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Giving aid to foreign countries does not decrease the wealth gap, nor does caring for the elderly. One cannot singlehandedly reduce the wealth gap by sending money to improve the conditions in an orphanage. One is more likely to reduce the wealth gap by developing the company in which one works so that more workers can be employed and paid higher wages. It is not necessarily the case that by behaving charitably you are likely to receive charity in the future. People are selfish and we do not live in small villages any longer where there is a higher degree of reciprocity. People tend to fall on hard times when there is a widespread economic recession in which case people are highly unlikely to behave charitably.</p>        </div>

                    <p>While we live in a materialist culture where it is often felt necessary to gather more and more stuff, often disposing of other items as we go along it is also very easy to give. There are thousands of charities that allow us to give to the needy either in terms of giving cash or our time and skills. These charities do work in all sorts of activities, from debate education like the international debate education association, to feeding the starving like Oxfam. In many cases we can give in local stores as well as online or by post. Those in the rich world also have lots of disposable income that they can give away. Toby Ord, a university researcher shows that it is possible to give away a lot to charity while not on an income that is particularly large by the standards of the developed world. He gives away over a third of his income of £25000 and still has plenty to live on. Ord believes that everyone in the rich world should give away a tenth of their earnings<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup>Geoghegan, 2010.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is not easy to reject the whole of materialist culture in order to give large amounts of one's income away to charity. Ord is notable and came up in the BBC magazine precisely because it is so unusual for someone to be willing to give so much away. Many people on £25,000 are using up almost all their money on living expenses, especially if they are looking after elderly relatives or bringing up children.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Giving aid is not only not morally required but it is in fact wrong. Neo-Malthusians argue that we need to control population on the grounds that excessive population growth will lead to a serious resource shortage crisis. The United Nations estimates that the 7th billion citizen will be born in 2011, with expectations that the population in Africa expected to double every twenty years thereafter<sup>1</sup>. This will be particularly problematic in countries like Pakistan, where the population growth will soon be unsustainable due to inadequate water supplies in the region<sup>2</sup>. By giving aid to the starving and ill we are allowing people to survive and reproduce, making resources more thinly spread not only in the present but also in the future.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/world-population-will-surpass-7-billion-in-2011-says-u-n-53174/"> http://www.christianpost.com/news/world-population-will-surpass-7-billion-in-2011-says-u-n-53174/</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2011\07\26\story_26-7-2011_pg3_3"> http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2011\07\26\story_26-7-2011_pg3_3</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>There is no reason to believe that agricultural and technological advances will not be able to keep up with population growth. Furthermore, refusing aid on the grounds that the population is too large is a denial of the fundamental value of human life and the principal of equality and is tantamount to a milder form of eugenics. If one believes that we should allow the ill and hungry to die, why not shut down the hospitals and let nature take its course? This is clearly absurd.</p><p>The Neo-Malthusian argument does not prove that we should not be charitable at all, merely that we should not be charitable where being charitable would save a life. It allows for visiting the elderly or providing money for an orphanage to be repainted, for example.</p>        </div>

We also have a right to our own money and there is no moral obligation to spend it on others. We deserve to keep what we have acquired. Wealthy people have worked hard to acquire their wealth and have invested money into becoming educated and qualified to earn that money. They deserve to keep it. David Beckham, for example, earns £500,000 every week playing football<sup>1</sup>. He earns a fortune not because he was lucky to be born with natural ability but through sheer persistence and hard-work as a child growing up in England. Now reaping the rewards of that effort, he has no obligation to spend that money on anyone other than himself. Hard-workers have the right to reward themselves.</p><p><sup>1</sup>Brown, 2007.</p>        </div>

                    <p>We do not protect rights unconditionally and even the existence of right is controversial. Even those who support property rights tend to agree that it is wrong not to pay one's tax and that tax plays an important role. This is an example where we feel it is ethical to waiver the right to property so it is not clear that this might not also be the case with aid. Furthermore, if impoverished people had had the opportunity to become wealthy, they would no doubt have taken that opportunity and put in just as much time and effort as those who are wealthy have done. We can't blame those who live below the breadline for being unemployed in nations where there is poor quality schooling and not enough jobs.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is largely accepted that we may not intervene in other states' affairs for, in doing so, we violate international law. Surely then we may not prevent states from implementing policies which may cause poverty. In North Korea during the 1990s, the government was unable to grow enough food to feed its population through its grain distribution program, resulting in a famine that is believed to have caused the deaths of over two million deaths<sup>1</sup>. Though patently clear that North Korea needed both to privatize and open their markets up in order to avoid such calamities, other countries were powerless to help due to the stoicism of the North Korean regime and current international law. If we are not allowed to prevent poverty then how can we be expected to alleviate it? We cannot be and so it is not our duty to do so.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.kinu.or.kr/upload/neoboard/DATA04/2004e.PDF"> <a href="http://www.kinu.or.kr/upload/neoboard/DATA04/2004e.PDF" title="http://www.kinu.or.kr/upload/neoboard/DATA04/2004e.PDF">http://www.kinu.or.kr/upload/neoboard/DATA04/2004e.PDF</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span> </a></p>        </div>
