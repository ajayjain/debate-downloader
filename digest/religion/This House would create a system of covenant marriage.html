    <h1 class="print-title">This House would create a system of covenant marriage</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Currently in the USA, there are 3 states (Louisiana, Arizona and Arkansas) that have more than one system of marriage contracts in place. One is the conventional marriage contract, where couples marry under the current &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; system in which either party can, at any time, dissolve the marriage. The other is a covenant marriage, where the couple wants a partnership that is more difficult to dissolve.</p>
<p>Next to the normal regulations for marriage, a couple that has decided to go through the process of covenant marriage signs a declaration, stating: &ldquo;We solemnly declare that marriage is a covenant between a&nbsp;man and a woman who agree to live together as husband and wife&nbsp;for as long as they both live. We have chosen each other carefully and have received premarital counseling on the nature, purposes&nbsp;and responsibilities of marriage. We understand that a&nbsp;covenant marriage is for life. If we experience marital difficulties, we commit ourselves to take all reasonable efforts to preserve our&nbsp;marriage, including marital counseling.&rdquo;<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>This concept has been established by activists in the United States, which were concerned about the divorce rates. Divorce is an unfortunate reality of American life. Recent statistics compiled by the US Census Bureau show that between 40% and 50% of marriages end in divorce<a href="/print/17789#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Many believe divorce can have a negative effect on society; accordingly, advocates of divorce reform have suggested giving couples the choice of covenant marriage.</p>
<p>This mainly Southern US movement is headquartered in Nashville, was established in May, 1999, by a group of religious leaders, politicians, educators, and counselors. The organization&#39;s goal is, &ldquo;to bring God deeper into marriage and re-establish marriage as a lifelong bond&rdquo;. The movement is supported by dozens of groups across the US, including the American Association of Christian Counselors, Family Foundations International, and Masterful Living.</p>
<p>The first laws recognizing covenant marriage were passed by the state of Louisiana in 1997. Arizona followed in 1998 and Arkansas in 2001; advocates are lobbying other state assemblies to pass similar legislation. The movement received considerable publicity on Valentine&rsquo;s Day 2005, when Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and his wife renewed their marriage vows of thirty years with a ceremonial signing of covenant marriage documents, along with a thousand other couples. Governor Huckabee (an ordained Southern Baptist minister) is publicly campaigning to halve Arkansas&rsquo; high divorce rate over ten years, and sees promoting covenant marriage as an important part of achieving that aim.</p>
<div>
	<p>IMPLEMENTATION:</p>
	<p>Couples, wanting to marry under the covenant system, in Louisiana, have to first get counseling by their spiritual leader (rabbi, priest &hellip;) and then can marry. If they wish to divorce they can do it after counseling and a specific ground for divorce: one spouse has committed adultery, one spouse has been sentenced to death or hard labor for a felony, one spouse has abandoned the other for at least a year, one spouse has physically or sexually abused the other spouse or their child, the couple has been separated for at least two years and in Arizona, a ground is also the spouse&#39;s habitual use of drugs.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[3]</a></p>

                    <p>The problem in today&rsquo;s society is that marriage has become for many people a piece of paper; they sign and, just as easily, terminate when things go wrong. Actually to a 2006 survey of 2134 women, 31 % thought marriage is no longer relevant in today&rsquo;s society and 71 % of couples thought that marriage happens too many times without thinking it through first.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>This process of covenant marriage gives the couples back the notion that marriage is not just a legal contract but a well thought-through decision. This is particularly prevalent bearing in mind the consequences it will have on the individual, their careers and even potential children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the premarital counseling by a trained counselor that is a requirement of covenant marriage enables the future husband and wife to get to know each other well. Issues such as how to raise children, how to split housework, and financial matters are discussed and explored with the counselor.</p>

                    <p>Making it a &ldquo;harder to get in, harder to get out&rdquo; bond is not the solution to problems within a marriage. Many ordinary couples make a conscious, well-intentioned yet ultimately mistaken decision when choosing to get married. Many things can happen, such as change in priorities, financial problems; unmet needs are among the most common reasons for divorce.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In covenant marriages, families in conflict are forced to stay together; this has the potential to harm children more than divorce would. Research shows that when parents stay in a high-conflict marriage, children fare worse than when their parents actually divorce. Children must be considered when parents&rsquo; are thinking about divorce, but with appropriate nurturing and support, children can cope with divorce and eventually have strong marriages of their own. In fact, studies show that a child of divorced parents is no more likely than a child of married parents to divorce later in life. Researchers in the UK also interviewed 341 children on how divorce affected them. They found that 80% of children of divorced parents said their home life was the same or better after divorce. Only a quarter wanted their parents to get back together.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>So because the individuals committing to a marriage have overthought it, sometimes it is just better to stop conflict than perpetuate it with staying together, there should not be covenant marriage.</p>

                    <p>In a covenant marriage, the offended spouse is the only one who can ask for the divorce. This gives the offended spouse many benefits in negotiating the end of the marriage. The &ldquo;stay at home&rdquo; spouse has clearly more to lose in assuming a marriage will last forever, especially if he/she puts her/his career on hold to care for children. A covenant marriage is a way for the individual to have more security in marriage. Many times, it happens that one of the spouses (usually the wife) has never established credit in her own name. And experts explain it&#39;s easier for a 15-year-old to get a credit card than it is for a 50-year-old divorced woman. She just gets deleted, from all the affairs.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp;Society as a whole has an interest in protecting the individual.</p>
<p>An advocate for covenant marriage, Amitai Etzioni, founder and director of the Washington-based Communitarian Network, says, &ldquo;One can be deeply concerned with strengthening the commitment of marriage without favoring traditional or hierarchical forms of marriages or denying individuals full equal standing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through covenant the stay at home spouses get more rights and certainty for financial security if the marriage does not work out anyway. Because the divorce law is very favorable towards them, because it is not their fault the marriage is falling apart.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Yes, in the past it really did happen that the criteria at divorces on how to help the spouses to get back into single life were unfair. Judges until currently were on their own in deciding how to prioritize the various factors and how to translate them into dollar amounts, resulting in wildly inconsistent alimony awards. When asked how much alimony a lifelong homemaker married to a doctor deserved, judges in an Ohio survey estimated as little as $5,000 a year and as much as $175,000.</p>
<p>New York state introduced certain criteria, which estimate more fairly the amounts spouses get, even at a no-fault divorce &ndash; they estimate the damage a marriage has done to the individual in terms of career prospects and self-development and based on that offer a fair settlement<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>So because there are better methods, such as court rulings on fairness, without pressuring the couple to stay together for what reason ever, we should support covenant marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Passage of no-fault divorce laws resulted in an onslaught of divorce and a breakdown of the American family. In 1968, the year before California adopted the nation&rsquo;s first no-fault divorce law, the US had 584 000 divorces (2.9 per 1 000 Americans). After 30 years of no-fault divorce, the number of divorces had reached 1 135 000 annually. Covenant marriages are the answer. Research has shown that 33% to 45% of couples on the brink of divorce may reconcile if they are legally prevented from divorcing for six months as specified in a covenant marriage.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>The problem is that divorce does not just affect the individuals in the marriage but also the children. Parents should be alert to signs of distress in their child or children. Young children may react in times of divorcing by becoming more aggressive and uncooperative or by withdrawing. Older children may feel deep sadness and loss. Their schoolwork may suffer and behavior problems are common. As teenagers and adults, children of divorce can have trouble with their own relationships and experience problems with self-esteem. Also long custody disputes or pressure on a child to &quot;choose&quot; sides can be particularly harmful for the youngster and can add to the damage of the divorce. Research shows that children do best when parents can cooperate on behalf of the child.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>This covenant marriage is no harder to escape than any other and if the spouse wants the divorce, they can easily travel to another state, to get the divorce they want in the heat of the discussion. Emory University explains that an estranged spouse can escape a covenant marriage simply by moving to and filing for divorce in any of the forty-seven American states or any number of foreign countries without covenant marriage options. Current conflict of laws rules, both domestic and international, do not favor the enforcement of covenant marriage laws over the contract marriage laws of the forum state where the divorce case is litigated.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Second of all, even in the very religious state, such as Arkansas, approximately 112,000 couples married in Arkansas in the first three years (2003 &ndash; 2006) of the new law and only 800 of them, less than one percent, took advantage of the covenant marriage license. Fewer than three percent of couples in Louisiana and Arizona agreed to the extra restrictions of a covenant marriage.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>So the wider effects on society will not happen, because people don&rsquo;t actually choose this type of marriage and in hardship can escape to other states.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>There is always danger when religion and law mix. With covenant marriage, which mainly is a religious request to &ldquo;maintain the sanctity of marriage&rdquo;, a concept supported by some religions.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union especially criticizes, that the law offers a prominent role to clergy in premarital counseling in order to get marries.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The concept of making separation harder, involving priests, rabies as the ones involved in the process of counseling is a law that is shaped to favor big religions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introducing such laws bears two greater dangers for society, which could be avoided by a separation of law and religion.</p>
<p>Firstly we have to talk about the growing pressure that introducing such a law brings on the state, if we consider other, more marginalized religions. For example if we have laws supporting and based on major religious moral frameworks, why then, does the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose founder sanctioned polygamy not get laws, to actually marry more than one person. About 2 % of the population in Utah is part of this religion, so why do they not get the opportunity to marry the way they want to.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>The law should be equal in giving rights to all, by making covenant marriage law; it gives more rights to some religions as it does to others and with this creates more inequality between religions. While laws should serve all people and be a tool of preventing discrimination.</p>

                    <p>First of all, it is hypocritical to state, that there ever was a total separation of church and state in the US. In matters of marriage in the United States,&nbsp;religious figures have traditionally been authorized by the state to perform marriages which are entitled to recognition under secular law. There has never been a clear separation between church and state in matters of celebration of marriage, even courts sometimes decided in favor of religious values instead of a fully secular decision<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. So we see, that the objection it is an infringement on the separation of church and state is false.</p>
<p>Further on, even if we believe this could be an infringement of church and state, this is just a problem of implementation, which can be very easily solved. For example the Louisiana legislation offers a secular alternative, making it a law, that value their relationship and want to have a better contract for it.&nbsp;The section of the Revised Statutes that describes the secular alternative to a clergyman uses the term&nbsp;marriage counselor. To enable couples of any religion to marry.</p>

                    <p>In a covenant marriage, a partner must prove that abuse actually occurred to be permitted to end the marriage. This especially worries advocates for battered women who say that proving domestic abuse can be difficult and the waiting period makes women stay in abusive relationships longer.</p>
<p>In addition, mental abuse is not seen as a legitimate reason to end a marriage. So what happens is that victims of emotional abuse, which includes&nbsp;<em>verbal abuse</em>&nbsp;such as yelling, name-calling, blaming, and shaming. Isolation, intimidation, and controlling behavior cannot act to protect themselves through divorce as others do. Additionally, abusers who use emotional or psychological abuse often throw in threats of physical violence or other repercussions if you don&rsquo;t do what they want.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>This type of violence is very severe and damaging to the victims, yet covenant marriage does not acknowledge as a ground for divorce. So it allows abuse to happen more easily, something, we should not allow in society.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Covenant marriage does not make the spouses stay in the same place; just it encourages them to try to solve their problems before filing for divorce.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to abuse, the spouse have more than just the option to file for a long divorce, they can separate, report the spouse to authorities because of violence and then file for divorce, after being separated.</p>
<p>Further on, abuse is always hard to prove, yet we still punish abusers in society &ndash; so it is possible to prove it and also through that divorce.</p>
<p>As is the regard to emotional abuse &ndash; since it has been only recently recognized as an important component of law against abusers, it is possible to amend the law and also include emotional abuse to the other reasons of divorce in a covenant marriage. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Some feminists feel initiatives for covenant marriage simply conceal the hidden agenda of the antifeminist Moral Majority. Liberal commentator Katha Pollitt, a columnist for The Nation, says covenant marriages &ldquo;enforce a narrow and moralistic vision of marriage by rendering divorce more painful and more punitive.&rdquo; Many advocates of covenant marriage laws are self-described conservative Christians; religious groups are major supporters of covenant marriage laws.</p>
<p>A study of several university experts shows that in interviews couples, married through the covenant marriage display a greater support and understanding of the stereotypical roles in a marriage. Many of the couples stated a traditional Christian perspective of wives as nurturers and homemakers and of husbands as breadwinners, protectors, and leaders of families. They endorsed the belief that a vow of marriage was a sacred, irrevocable trust. The covenant-married couples uniformly felt that contemporary wives and husbands were &ldquo;falling really short&rdquo; in their obligations and responsibilities to one another and to society as a whole. Further on explaining that they capitalistic nature of today&rsquo;s society where both spouses work degrades also their marriage in many ways.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Such thinking, which is perpetuated by the state allowing a tighter approach to divorce is bad especially for children as it teaches them, that not all people have the same position in life and that some (usually the women) are meant to stay at home and nurture the family.</p>
<p>Covenant marriage is concerning especially because it reinforces the &ldquo;traditional values&rdquo; and also mentality regarding marriage. It does not stop just at divorce, but also sends out the message, that the state support traditional role division in a family. And this a dangerous path the state is on, as it could lead to more discrimination and a less equal society. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Religious communities have always been a driver of decisions, especially on reproductive rights. But what we have to realize is that change towards a more equal and inclusive society has to be done within the community with more information and action.</p>
<p>Through campaigns and information, there were significant&nbsp; improvements in the number of people supporting abortions among religious communities,&nbsp; 72 percent of White mainline Protestants, 56 percent of African American Protestants, and 58% of White Catholics currently think abortion services should be available not only at the community level but in their communities.<a href="/print/17789#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>The state has done very little with just passing a law supporting abortion. The main work had to be done through information to gain approval for abortion.</p>
<p>The same is the case for covenant marriage, just because it might make divorce harder, it does not mean it will support stereotypical role division. In order to fight a role division within the communities, there has to be more effort &ndash; workshops, information, that will help find a solution.</p>
