    <div class="print-content"><p>Atheism, put simply, is the absence of belief in any deities. This view is ordinarily contrasted with theism, the belief in one or more deities. A third position, agnosticism, which claims to be a position of skepticism by which an individual claims not to know whether a deity exists and is unwilling to make a statement one way or the other. Agnosticism is attacked by atheists who claim that it is not a philosophically valid position to hold as one either believes something, usually when positive evidence is provided for such belief, or one does not believe, meaning there is no evidence to encourage belief. Theists and self-styled agnostics often claim that atheism is not philosophically justified, since in the absence of positive evidence against the existence of a deity the rational position is admission of lack of knowledge one way or the other. Atheists, on the other hand, contend that the rational default position in absence of evidence is disbelief. In discussing this debate it is necessary to narrow the parameters to the discussion as it is conventionally portrayed and analysed, meaning that the debate will take place largely within the parameters of the Abrahamic religions (Islam, Christianity, Judaism), since atheists most often come from the developed world where these religions predominate. These religions share many of the aspects attributed to deities, and thus can be discussed together. Trying to bring in non-monotheistic religions, such as Hinduism or Zoroastrianism would entirely alter the debate, since they would revolve around very different conceptions of life, morality, goodness, the Universe, and the supernatural. Thus this debate will keep its focus on the narrower, Abrahamic conception of God and the justifications for atheism stemming from it. Debates on the issue of atheism’s validity centre around the philosophical justification for atheist belief and the empirical, philosophical, and logical evidence for and against the existence of a deity and for the truth of atheism.</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

                    <p>Physics and cosmology explain the development and evolution of the Universe and the bodies within it. Chemistry explains the interactions of substances and the origin of life. Biology explains the development of life’s complexity through the long process of evolution. God, or gods, is a superfluous entity in the discussion of existence; He is entirely unnecessary to human scientific understanding.<a href="/print/17737#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> At best, believers can point to various missing links in science’s explanation, using God to fill the gaps. The God of the Gaps is a weak God whose domain grows smaller each day as science progresses. Furthermore, there is no evidence of the supernatural existing at all, if that is what God is meant to be. The burden of proof in a debate concerning the existence of something is on the individual making the positive claim. In a debate over the existence of God, it is up to the believer to provide evidence for that belief.<a href="/print/17737#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The rational position in the absence of evidence is atheism. It is not a positive claim about anything, but is merely the absence of belief in God, which makes sense in the light of there being no positive evidence of God’s existence. If believers claim God lives outside the Universe, or that He cannot be empirically identified due to His ethereal nature, then in truth they are saying nothing. Only the natural world exists insofar as humans can demonstrate. The supernatural is pure fantasy.</p><div><a href="/print/17737#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Boyer, Pascal. 2001.

                    <p>Science cannot explain everything. People have spoken of the existence of the soul and of God through the ages because reason and logic are sometimes not enough to explain the complexity and depth of the human experience. God is far more than the occupier of the gaps in scientific knowledge. However, the gaps are indicative of the limitations of science and show that faith and God can still have a place in human comprehension of the world.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Evil may be thought of as the absence of good. It is a privation of goodness, just as darkness is the absence of light.

People have the ability to make both good and bad choices; if they did not then they would not truly be free.

It seems that as human knowledge of the Universe expands and as social institutions develop and improve, people feel less dependent upon the crutch of religious faith, and place greater store in reason.<a href="/print/17737#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> If God existed He would make His existence clear to all humanity, not just to a chosen few. In so doing His wisdom would naturally drown out an earthly knowledge, which would obviously be inferior to any that might be furnished by an omniscient being.<a href="/print/17737#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> God has clearly never imparted His wisdom to people since no such divine wisdom exists in any holy book. Were there a correct holy book currently in use, it would necessarily be the only one, because everyone would acknowledge its superiority at once. Reality shows all holy books to be flawed works of flawed men. There is no glimmer of divine spark in any of them, and the only thing that separates most of them from the ravings of madmen is that large groups of people have chosen to believe them. The more reasonable conclusion is one of atheism, and that people believe in God out of ignorance, not revelation.</p><div><a href="/print/17737#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Drange, Theodore. 1998.

                    <p>It is unreasonable to suggest that God must reveal Himself to humanity, or to make His existence manifestly clear because that would undermine the value of faith.<a href="/print/17737#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Belief is an important component of all religious teachings because it is what allows the soul to transcend the material world and to commune with the divinity. For the religious, a life without faith is meaningless. Furthermore, if God were to make His desires and commands known, then free will would be undermined. It is necessary to the exercise of individual human agency that God not dictate every command to people. That is why God leaves life, at least on the surface, up to humans.</p><div><a href="/print/17737#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Maitzen, Stephen. 2006.

                    <p>A creator god is a logical absurdity, as demonstrated by empirical fact and rational reflection. Certainly God cannot exist outside of the Universe, as such a concept is effectively meaningless. In fact, physics explains that when the Universe expanded as an inflating field of space and time as the result of a quantum fluctuation, causality itself arose from the process, making a causative agent “prior” to the Universe not only unnecessary, but also impossible. Furthermore, the idea of an omnipotent God is logically contradictory because if God were omnipotent He would be able to create an entity greater than Himself, yet that is impossible.<a href="/print/17737#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The very attribute is logically unfounded, making the conventional explanation of God invalid. Thus atheism, the absence of belief in gods, is the only logically justified theological position.</p><div><a href="/print/17737#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Savage, C. 1967.

                    <p>Just because God cannot be understood by conventional understandings of physics and logic does not invalidate His existence. In fact, it is unsurprising that trying to discuss the attributes of God would confound human reason. That is why faith is essential to understanding, and why science and reason are limited tools. Thus even if one considers the conventional description of God to be unsatisfactory, it is not sufficient reason to conclude that God does not exist. That is why one should at best adopt a position of agnosticism.</p>        </div>

                    <p>God, like unicorns, has never been shown to exist, and thus it is logical to accept that He, just like unicorns, does not exist. That is why a position like agnosticism makes no sense. There are no agnostics on the subject of unicorns; there are only agnostics on the subject of God because people tend to be reticent to say they are atheists due to the prevalence of belief of God even in the most secular societies. But fantasy is fantasy, and an agnostic is really just an atheist by another name. Were someone to claim that dragons exist, the person he told it to would not be justified responding saying he did not know whether they exist and that it must be an open question until evidence is presented to corroborate the claim.<a href="/print/17737#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Rather, he would likely respond with disbelief in the absence of evidence. That is how reasoning works. Thus agnosticism is a philosophically meaningless position. There is either belief or lack of belief, atheism or theism. Opponents of atheism seeking to hide in the nebulous realm of agnosticism, or who claim that because one cannot know there is no God one must be agnostic, hold a position that is philosophically bankrupt.</p><div><a href="/print/17737#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Dawkins, Richard. 2006.

Atheism is a positive claim insofar as it is a statement about the nonexistence of God. The burden of proof is thus not so clearly on the shoulders of theism alone.

                    <p>The reason people believe in God and why religions have formed can be explained perfectly well by natural processes and psychology. Religion is an outgrowth of humans’ brain architecture developed through the process of evolution; it developed as a by-product of other useful cognitive processes.<a href="/print/17737#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> For example, survival capability is promoted by an ability to infer the presence of potentially hostile organisms, the ability to establish causal narratives for natural occurrences, and the ability to recognize that other people are independent agents, with their own minds, desires, and intentions.<a href="/print/17737#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> These cognitive mechanisms, while invaluable to human survival and communal development, have the effect of causing humans to imagine supernatural purposefulness behind natural phenomena that could not be explained by other means. No gods are required to explain religious belief, so the existence of such belief is no reason to believe in such beings. Religion was a cradle during mankind’s childhood and adolescence.

                    <p>Atheism does not seek to explain the origin of the Universe, life, etc.; that is what science is for. Atheism is about the existence of God. The atheist position is supported, however, by the fact that there is no evident design in the Universe. People tend to anthropomorphize their environment, trying to assign human-like qualities to animals and nature. All of the complexity in the Universe can be attributed to natural processes; the Universe, stars, and life are all the product of physical and chemical interactions. There is no mystery in the basic process. Complexity can be shown to arise from less complex conditions without aid of intelligent agency. Clearly, complexity is not indicative of a creator. The complexity of the Universe does nothing to support claims for the existence of a deity, but rather showcases the wondrousness of the natural world.</p>        </div>
