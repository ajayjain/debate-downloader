    <div class="print-content"><p>Imagine that one day you come across five people in immediate and mortal peril.&nbsp; You and you alone can save them, but doing so will kill one other person.&nbsp; For instance, five people may be in path of an out-of-control trolley that could be diverted onto a track where there is only one person.&nbsp; You are aware of no morally relevant differences between the six people: none of them are murderers or saints who especially “deserve” to live or die, and none of them ended up in this situation due to their own negligence or transgressions.&nbsp; Given such a situation (hereafter referred to as the “thought experiment”), the resolution is that you should opt to actively kill the one person in order to save the many.</p><p>Two terms are useful for understanding this debate.&nbsp; “Utilitarianism” is the ethical view that, broadly speaking, prescribes whatever course of action will result in the greatest good, usually measured by adding up the total amount of good (also known as “utility”, and which in practice usually means happiness or some other measure of a thriving life) that accrues to everyone<a href="/print/17824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.&nbsp; According to utilitarianism, the correct act is that which results in the highest total utility, regardless of what actions it is that bring that state about; because of its emphasis on consequences, it is sometimes known as “consequentialism.”&nbsp; According to utilitarianism, we generally ought not to kill, and ought to keep promises, because doing so makes everyone better off.&nbsp; “Deontology”, by contrast, is the ethical view that prescribes a moral agent to act in accordance with specific rules, regardless of their consequences<a href="/print/17824#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Deontology will, for instance, prescribe specific moral duties not to kill, and to always keep promises, not because of their results, but simply because we ought to do them.&nbsp; Deontological rules are often justified on the basis of treating each person as they deserve and respecting them not as a “mere means.”</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17824#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Sinnott-Armstrong, Walter, "Consequentialism", <em>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N.

                    <p>We have good reasons to value keeping people alive: it allows people the opportunity to enjoy their time on Earth and effect changes to everyone’s benefit, even if that simply means being around for our loved ones.&nbsp; Most people would even go so far as to say that, by virtue of being conscious creatures, human beings deserve to live.&nbsp; That is to say, they have a right not to suffer an untimely death.&nbsp; This is the reason that we normally abhor killing: it cuts short human life.&nbsp; However, in this thought experiment, the inescapable reality is that someone’s right to life will be violated.&nbsp; Either the one or the five will die, and all the horrible results attached to the cessation of a human life will inevitably befall one of the groups.&nbsp; In light of this fact, our moral obligation is to reduce the number of people whose right to life is violated and maximize the number for whom that right is actualized.&nbsp; One ought to commit the act that results in the fewest deaths, and that is to kill the one and save the five.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The idea of a “right to life,” while appealing, is highly suspect.&nbsp; “Rights” are the highest order of human entitlements, things which one can reasonably expect will never ever happen to them, and which if violated represent a colossal failure of our moral and legal infrastructure.&nbsp; In reality, people die all the time for a variety of natural and artificial reasons, and while we certainly think that these deaths are unfortunate, we don’t think that someone’s human rights were infringed upon every time someone dies in a motor vehicle accident.&nbsp; By contrast, we do have an actual right not to be murdered.&nbsp; When one human being deliberately kills another human being, we rightly see that as an exceptional and grave violation of a basic human right.&nbsp; Therefore, it doesn’t violate anyone’s rights to let the five people die, but it certainly does violate the right of putative sixth person to actively murder them to save the others.&nbsp; Moreover, it may be questionable to assume that all lives are equally valuable; if we are going to engage in the grisly business of actually summing up human lives, why treat someone who we’d expect to only live for another year equal to someone we can expect to live for another sixty?&nbsp; If the advocate of killing the one is going to adopt a “maximizing” ethical view, they should at least commit to a true utilitarianism, rather than a view that is not necessarily supported by either utilitarianism or deontology; treating all deaths as equal, regardless of much they cut a life short, is not something a utilitarian would get behind.</p>        </div>

We are all different people, and we do not all share in the alleged benefits to maximizing total utility.&nbsp; For this reason, our moral intuitions reject out-of-hand many variants on “killing one to save five”; for instance, we would think it abhorrent to abduct a random person and harvest their organs in order to save five dying people, even in the absence of side effects like people now being afraid of having their organs taken.&nbsp; Also, see “different lives weigh differently” argument below.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17824#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Richardson, Henry S., ‘John Rawls (1921-2002)’, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 18 November 2005, <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/rawls/" title="http://www.iep.utm.edu/rawls/">http://www.iep.utm.edu/rawls/</a> &nbsp;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>While Rawls did oppose utilitarianism, he generated a hypothetical scenario that is useful, even to the utilitarian, for evaluating moral theories.&nbsp; Imagine that all human beings were placed in a scenario where they knew nothing about their station in the world, and know only the basic laws of reasoning and human nature.&nbsp; They do not know what their level of intelligence, personality traits, gender, socioeconomic status, race or religion will be, nor even when or where they will be born; they are “behind the veil of ignorance.”&nbsp; Every single person who will ever exist is placed in this situation at the beginning of the universe.&nbsp; Next, these human beings are told they will decide which rules will govern human conduct when they come to inhabit the world.&nbsp; In such a situation, all rational human beings would ensure that they are treated fairly no matter who they are; they will have perfect sympathy for every human being ever, because they could end up being that person.&nbsp; Whatever rules they come up with in this situation are the rules that are ethically correct, because these rules will never treat anyone unfairly (as that would be an irrational move).<a href="/print/17824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp; So how would people in this hypothetical treat the decision whether to kill one to save five?&nbsp; Rational actors would agree on the rule to kill the one and save the five.&nbsp; After all, any given person is five times as likely to end up as a member of the five rather than as the one.&nbsp; Thus, behind the veil of ignorance, the rational human being would proudly prescribe “Save the five and kill the one.”</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17824#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Rawls, John, <em>A Theory of Justice</em>, Harvard University press, 1971, p.136</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
