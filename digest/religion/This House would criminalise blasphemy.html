    <h1 class="print-title">This House would criminalise blasphemy</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Blasphemy is the act of showing contempt or speaking offensively about a deity or of persons and symbols regarded as sacred by the followers of a specific religion. The concept of blasphemy is mostly associated with the Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Judaism and Islam) and many nation states which affiliate with one of these religions would most likely at some point, or still do have, laws against committing such acts against the dominant home religion. As the world in general becomes more liberal and secular however the need for such laws has come into question. In many European nations blasphemy laws are still in existence but lay dormant and unused whereby in contrast many middle-eastern Muslim nations actively enforce their blasphemy laws via a system of Sharia law. There have been numerous debates on the issue of blasphemy at the UN, with one of the most in-depth taking place in 2009 whereby Pakistan on the 26th March proposed a resolution which condemned “defamation of religion” as a human rights violation which passed by 23 to 11 but with a high 13 abstentions. (UN, 2009) Later in 2010 on the same issue the European Union ambassador Jean-Baptiste Mattei argued that the “concept of defamation should not fall under the remit of human rights because it conflicted with the right to freedom of expression” (Swiss Info, 2010) The main contention then between whether or not such laws should still exist lies between the value of freedom of speech against protecting the right of religious freedom. Should then Blasphemy illegal or should such laws against it laws be lifted?</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-editors">

                    <p>Blasphemy cannot be shielded by the rationale which is used to defend freedom of speech. The sole purpose of blasphemy is to offend. We protect freedom of speech in our society not as a good in and of itself, but because through debate of even the most improbable propositions, the best ideas will out and society will be enriched by the discourse. Free speech therefore should have redeeming value. It should contribute to the free marketplace of ideas. But language aimed solely at offense has no redeeming value and does not contribute to the free marketplace of ideas. It does not further any discussion. It does not admit of discourse. It does not appeal to reason. In other words, none of the justifications of free speech apply in the case of blasphemy.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Blasphemy can be a valuable act of expression. It is false that it serves no redeeming purpose. Even irreverent humour or mockery has to make a point in order to be successful. For example, the act of angering someone by ridiculing their deity, or tenets of their faith, could make the point that a particular religion is closed-minded or too hidebound. It is not for a government to decide whether blasphemous statements contribute to the free marketplace of ideas; it’s up to the individuals engaged in that exchange. Secondly not all statements which are deemed blasphemous are created solely to offend as is suggested, saying that God does not exist could be received as offensive whereas in a scientific context it is said simply to reflect the available evidence.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Laws regarding discrimination such as the blasphemy law promote social cohesion, which is an important reason as to why the law should remain. The United Nations General Assembly in 2006 argued “defamation of religions is among the causes of social disharmony and leads to violations of human rights”.(United Nations General Assembly, ‘Combating defamation of religions’, 2006) In a globalized and multicultural society people of different creeds and viewpoints need to coexist. Discrimination laws are instrumental in making that reality a peaceful one. They signify a welcome society, in which it is unacceptable to offend entire segments of the population by debasing what they hold most precious. Furthermore such laws get people to consider more deeply the cultural differences between one another for the positive rather than remaining single-minded and bigoted towards other peoples cultural and spiritual views and behaviors</p>        </div>

                    <p>Blasphemy laws are not always positive for societal relations, they can also escalate social tensions which may already exist between groups. Telling people they no longer have recourse to words to voice their disagreements and discontentment might push them to resort to violence instead. What anti-blasphemy laws would do is reduce violence as using words as an outlet would not incur a criminal sanction. While words can be powerful it must be much more preferable to allow people to speak freely, even if what is said is not always constructive, over allowing violence. The argument that blasphemy laws would bring different parts of society together then is nonsense; firstly such laws tend to favor the largest religion in a society which would be to the detriment of minorities but also just because certain discourse is blocked does not mean that individuals will inherently become more educated about other cultures and beliefs. This is the case for example in Pakistan where minorities are rarely protected by blasphemy laws and are often persecuted by it, buts being a member of the Ahmadi sect is synonymous with being blasphemous to Islam and without having to prove intent the law is therefore used to persecute them and other minorities.(Mehmood, ‘Pakistan blasphemy laws retake center stage’, 2011)</p>        </div>

                    <p>Blasphemy is dangerous. It directly or indirectly incites violence. The blasphemy law simply aims to close a subtle loophole; if you were to incite hatred against someone because of the colour of their skin that would be a serious crime. But if you were to do so because of their religious beliefs that would not be considered criminal without the existence of blasphemy laws. Many free democracies already prohibit the incitement of violence, or do not protect such speech. For example, even the United States, which has broad protections of free speech enshrined in the Constitution, does not protect fighting words which are designed to invite a violent response. When you’re insulting somebody’s religion, something that is fundamental to their character, and which they value above all else you can generally expect strong retaliation which can and often does erupt into violence. It is therefore necessary to prevent as early as possible a slippery slope from using offensive words to actual violence. (Williams, ‘Archbishop’s lecture - Religious Hatred and Religious Offence, 2008) There is a strong social purpose in a law that can prevent violence so whether religious or not a law against blasphemy is justifiable.</p>        </div>

                    <p>There are two key flaws to the propositions argument, firstly the assertion that words which others may find offensive will more often than not result in violence is a misnomer. Firstly language does not make people violent, while it can be a reaction to it, it is entirely a subjective choice, you therefore should not make something illegal just because the recipients of a type of speech can’t control themselves. You should expect and require people to moderate their behavior. It’s not acceptable for someone to resort to violence in response to words, and no society is well-served by permitting it. The assumption made by the proposition then is that violence is the default reaction to blasphemy, this is to essentially remove peoples’ agency; it is assumed they had no choice but to react violently. This would mean that they could not be punished under many legal standards as their action was out of their hands. Secondly the idea that all blasphemy is offensive enough to cause violence is wrong, some blasphemy while interpreted as being offensive to a belief system can be and often is handled via a constructive dialogue.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is reasonable to guard the sensibilities of the public. We do it all the time. There is no intrinsic harm to someone walking down the high street naked, but we prohibit it because it offends the public’s sensibilities. The same goes for cursing in public, and an array of other acts. In much the same way, we should prohibit this speech act that will offend so many people’s sensibilities and make things much less pleasant for everyone.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

It is not offence but harm which should guide the criminalization of behaviour in a free society. Harm can be objectively established; we have ways of knowing with reasonable certainty what is likely to cause it. Those are solid premises on which to set up a law which is meant to guide the behaviour of our citizens. But there is no such objective way of establishing offence. If offense is defined in terms of displeasing activities, its potential scope is vast. Anything you choose to do might irritate or exasperate me. But simply telling someone not to say anything which might cause any offense falls short of providing good guidance, which is what any law should do.</span></font></p>        </div>

                    <p>Reinstating blasphemy laws is a backwards step to take, it rejects the philosophical developments gained since the enlightenment which encouraged a break away from religion; developments which have distinctively helped make societies much fairer and freer places. Protecting the sensibilities of people over the freedom of speech prevents societal growth, it favors the status quo rather than trying to make improvements to all strata of things. Without free exchange of ideas and opinions societies are unlikely to change for the better. What blasphemy laws serve to do is promote a regressive society.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is unfair to suggest the blasphemy laws would promote society regressing. What the opposition argument fails to recognize is that during the enlightenment and following periods blasphemy laws co-existed with society reorganizing itself away from being dominated by religion. This then demonstrates that having blasphemy laws does not necessarily prevent or slow progress, implemented correctly such laws can happily coincide with liberal democracy. All blasphemy laws wish to do is restrict that which may be offensive in order to make society a nicer place, not in order for religion to regain its former overbearing power.</p>        </div>

                    <p>“Blasphemy” is a very subjective term. Cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed published in Denmark in 2005 were regarded by many as blasphemy, but to others they were a form of incisive commentary. (Badkhen A. 2006) If the guiding principle is what the recipients of a certain type of speech will find offensive, that will vary widely from person to person even within the members of a certain religious group. Some may find a remark truly offensive and some might not find it offensive at all. Where would we set the bar? We would have to draw an arbitrary line in the sand. This is problematic, because it would fail to provide guidance to citizens with respect to what the law requires of them. And it would only arbitrarily offer succour to the alleged victims of blasphemy, depending on whether the remarks fall on either side of this arbitrary line.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Establishing a legal definition for a crime is never a simple matter. It is an intricate and complicated task which requires extensive consideration. And yet we have to surpass this obstacle all the time with the laws we adopt as a society. We frequently have to define nuanced offenses like libel or harassment or hate crimes. The definition will never be perfect and will have to be supplemented by a level of discretion on behalf of the judiciary, as with every other law. However, although any law or definition we come up with might never perfectly correspond to the targeted behavior, it does not mean we should never attempt to create a law merely because it would be difficult to do so. If the social imperative for such a law to exist is great enough, we should do it.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Blasphemy laws can be used to oppress individuals in society, they are often exploited by totalitarian regimes around the world to victimize religious minorities, intellectuals and artists, reporters and human rights defenders, as well as opponents of the ruling class. It amounts to state censorship. It is the state which drafts the law and its organs then apply it, deciding which cases will or will not be prosecuted. It might be enforced unevenly by the government, thus favoring certain religions and victimizing others. It could be used to limit the expression of unpopular ideas, which are the ones that need the most protection, as has happened in the past with the work of artists criticizing the social and political mores of the time with previous cases showing their books being banned from libraries or their paintings from art galleries. Take for example the banning of Salman Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses in numerous states around the world. (Bald, M. 2006)</p>        </div>

                    <p>While it is true that blasphemy laws could be open to misuse, this is also true of many other laws that are currently enacted, as long as the correct safeguards are in place this should not be an issue for implementing such a law. On the whole the majority of countries around the world are fair and liberal democracies whereby such worries of misuse should be less of a concern.&nbsp; In totalitarian nations such as those described by the opposition if blasphemy laws did not exist the Governments would simply find different ways in which to censor that which it deems unfit, take for example in China where the state promotes Atheism and therefore no blasphemy law can exist, they still manage to repress speech, take for example the Falun Gong religion and all references to it (BBC, 2004), it does this without utilizing blasphemy laws, it is unfair then to associate the intrinsic failings of a political system down to a single law which is essentially being misused for political advantage. On the whole blasphemy law in liberal nations would be handled in a fair judicial manner.</p>        </div>
