    <h1 class="print-title">This house would not allow schools to display the Ten Commandments</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>According to the Bible, the Ten Commandments (or Decalogue) are a list of laws handed down from God to Moses, and as such they are highly revered in Christianity and Judaism. Different sects of Christianity and Judaism often use different texts for the Decalogue, and Islam&#39;s holy book, the Qur&#39;an, mentions the Commandments, though it does not list them. Regardless of what form the laws take, they are frequently seen as being highly charged with religious meaning. Some public schools in the past have displayed the Ten Commandments, as have other state institutions such as courthouses. This has prompted various organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to present legal challenges to the displays. In 1980, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Stone v. Graham that the Ten Commandments could not be displayed in schools, but the issue of state display of the text continues to be controversial and many religious activists frequently try to have the decision overturned. More recent Supreme Court cases regarding the Ten Commandments on state property<sup>1</sup> have resulted in divided rulings and no principled conclusion. While most of these arguments can be applied to debates about religion and state more broadly, this topic is framed in the context of the USA, where the debate most commonly takes place.</p>

                    <p>Many of the things cited as demonstrating society's "moral decline" are in fact hotly contested issues. For instance, many believe that abortions should be freely accessible and that gay marriage should be a constitutionally protected right. Nearly half the Commandments refer to specifically religious obligations, such as keeping the Sabbath, and some of the things it prohibits, such as adultery, are not illegal.<sup>1</sup> This shows that the Commandments' sense of morality does not necessarily align with our modern secular one.</p><p>Posting them may in fact lead to more school shootings, not less.<sup>2</sup> By alienating students who are of a different religious background or nonreligious, you create more antagonism between students in the school setting. <sup>3</sup></p><p>If you just want to show that murder is wrong, why not quote the state statute against murder?<sup>4</sup> This is clearly trying to demonstrate a connection to God, and that is bound to be offensive.</p><p>The United States has banned the Ten Commandments in classrooms since 1980 and is still one of the most religious countries in the world.<sup>5</sup> This is clearly not a necessary measure to prevent depravity and immorality.</p><p><sup>1</sup>Van Orden v.

                    <p>The Declaration of Independence and other founding documents cite a divine "Creator"<sup>1</sup> and the laws and jurisprudence of early America are largely derived from this law code.<sup>2</sup> The pilgrims and many other early settlers came to America for religious reasons, after all.<sup>3</sup> There are all sorts of other indications of Americans religious heritage, like the fact that "In God We Trust" is printed on the currency. The Decalogue is an important document worth posting in our nation's educational institutions, even for those who do not subscribe to the same religious ideals.

                    <p>There may have been some religious influences in early America, but this is a sweeping overstatement. Most of the Founding Fathers such as John Adams were Deists rather than Christians.</p><p>And anyway, the fact that something is associated with the history of America does not automatically make it worth venerating – slavery was a powerful and long-lasting institution at this point.&nbsp; Just as our culture has come to reject slavery, our religious ideals have evolved to be much more pluralist and welcoming to Hindus, Muslims, and atheists, even though many Protestant communities would have been inimical to them at the country’s outset.&nbsp;</p><p>The minimal expression reflected in something like the motto “In God We Trust” or “God save the United States and this Honorable Court” is acceptable because it is so minor and not nearly as forceful a display or establishment of a particular religion as the enshrinement of one religion’s legal code would be.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Finally, intent matters, and empirically, most attempts to place the Ten Commandments stem from school districts’ belief that this is a Christian nation, not out of a desire to teach history.<sup>1</sup></p><p>* McCreary County v.

                    <p>Rarely is there a moral issue that does not require a nuanced explanation in some situations. There is no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater, however. The Ten Commandments form a good baseline from which children can learn, and then, as they become older, issues like the death penalty or just wars can be explained to them in more depth. Even if these are not absolute guidelines, they can still be useful simplifications. Just as we teach children calculus or other advanced mathematics only after we have taught them division and multiplication, we can build their moral knowledge starting with "thou shall not kill" and then later explain more complicated ethical exceptions.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Public schools are run by the government and as such have an obligation to cleave to that principle of separation of church and state. It is against the Ten Commandments to believe in "other gods", but we expressly permit belief in other religious systems and atheism via constitutional protections. Not only is this a violation of the principle of separation, but it also sends a mixed message to those groups, and runs the risk of alienating those who do not conform to these ideals.<sup>1</sup> Posting the Decalogue is obviously tremendously divisive - a serious culture war of lawsuits, protests, and speech has been waged over the issue. Unless schools were to post texts for literally every religion and atheism as well, this goal cannot be achieved if the Ten Commandments are in the classroom.<sup>2</sup> Neutrality is the best antidote to contemporary culture wars.<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Van Orden v.

                    <p>This practice of posting the Commandments largely exists in conservative communities which wholeheartedly embrace religion and the message of the Ten Commandments. By and large, only outsiders tend to question core aspects of the culture in the school districts that post the Decalogue.<sup>1</sup> While minority rights need to be respected, we should not structure the rules of society such that the urge of the majority to express something that is fundamental to them – religious belief – is consistently suppressed because of a few naysayers or legal organizations who do not understand the norms.&nbsp; They can go elsewhere, to communities that share their religious views or lack thereof.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Sieff, Kevin.&nbsp; “Ten Commandments in school stirs fight in Va.

                    <p>If any students vehemently disagree with the message, they can simply avert their eyes since this is a passive display. It is just a piece of paper hanging on a wall; it is not as though the Decalogue is being put in a gold case and teachers are forcing the students to worship at it for ten minutes at the start of every school day.<sup>1</sup> Nor are students tested on it or required to learn what it says; it is an entirely optional opportunity.<sup>2</sup> Those who do not believe in the Ten Commandments would do better to let the majority have their display and simply ignore it themselves.

                    That there are multiple versions of the Ten Commandments presents a hurdle, since the choice to display any particular version is an enshrinement of that specific interpretation and consequently, even other Christian groups will be offended and oppose it.        </div>

                    <p>The text is often translated differently from the original Hebrew, reflecting variances in intent on the part of different sects, such as Protestants, Jews, and Catholics.

                    <p>Our legislators must be conscious of the dangers of wrapping the Ten Commandments in the flag and indicating that one faith or religious set of laws is more patriotic or representative of the nation's fundamental values than another.<sup>1</sup> That idea can easily be used as a weapon against a minority's group rights as well as their sense of belonging to the country. Regardless of the role they may have played at the founding, our current society is an extraordinarily multicultural one, composed of a variety of religious minorities, including Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The world has seen a tremendous rise in Islamic extremism as well as in conservative xenophobic reactions to it (for instance, the 2011 Breivik attacks in Norway), and to prevent such things from happening, our children need to know how to live together peacefully and value all backgrounds.</p><p><sup>1</sup>McCreary County v.

                    <p>There isn't anything wrong with displaying or teaching the historical foundations of the country, even if we have expanded beyond that original vision since then. In fact, maintaining that heritage and our connections to it is very important if we are to remember who we are as a people. The courts have ruled that the legislature is allowed to have a chaplain lead prayers before legislative sessions because it represents a tradition dating back to the very first meetings of the legislature in the country.<sup>1</sup> Such practices are reasonable ways to honour our past. Extremism is certainly a scourge to the world, but it is often perpetrated by psychologically disturbed or unbalanced individuals; more "political correctness" in schools will not make a meaningful difference. Following such traditions will not prevent teaching to respect all faiths.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Van Orden v. Perry, oral argument</p>        </div>
