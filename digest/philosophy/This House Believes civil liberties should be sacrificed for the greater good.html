    <div class="print-content"><p>The events of September 11th 2001 resulted in governments all over the world taking extraordinary measures to enhance the security of their citizens. Whether this was justified or not is yet another flashpoint in the age old battle of liberty versus security.</p><p>In the US, new security measures included unparalleled airport checkpoint procedures, face recognition devices in public places, tracking, monitoring and identification through thumb printing of certain categories of visitors, random searches of Internet content by intelligence officers, the ability to demand records on somebody from any business or organisation, the use of wiretaps and the ability to intercept and read email, and eavesdropping on conversations between a lawyer and their client. The possible use of racial profiling to target “suspicious individuals” for more thorough searches and questioning is also being seriously discussed, although allegedly not in operation. Most of these measures are associated with loss of privacy; liberty has also been directly infringed through the detention without charge or trial of non-citizens, on the grounds they do not enjoy the same rights as citizens, the designation of US citizens as enemy combatants and their indefinite detention, and by trying suspects through military tribunals rather than in a normal court with judge and jury.</p><p>On the one hand, extraordinary security measures are required to counteract the imminent threats of terrorism that has become much more cunning and resourceful over the last decade. On the other hand, the introduction of these measures comes at the expense of sacrificing some of our most cherished civil liberties and rights as citizens. No doubt, there is a trade-off between security and liberty, but what is the ideal balance between them?</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>Terrorism is part of the modern world and is inextricably linked with the rise of modern communications, the internet, and a global community. This is an age in which space and time are bending to the tune of new media – information at your fingertips may sound nice, but for those who want to destroy, it only makes their object easier to attain. And so more strict national security measures must be employed in order to keep up with the enemy. Escalation is the name of the game imposed on governments around the world by terrorists for example the Mumbai terrorists used GPS systems to guide them into Mumbai, attacks were coordinated on cell and satellite phones and Blackberrys were used to monitor the international reaction <a href="/print/17802#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. In order to keep up states need new powers to stop, deter, and prevent terrorism. The government needs to secure state-security first; only then can the debate on civil liberties begin, and only then.</p><div><a href="/print/17802#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Shachtman, Noah, ‘How Gadgets Helped Mumbai Attackers’, Wired, 1 December 2008, <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/12/the-gagdets-of/" title="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/12/the-gagdets-of/">http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/12/the-gagdets-of/</a>, accessed 9 September 2011</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Negative cases of security abuse are few and have been greatly exaggerated by an emphatic civil rights lobby that has no empathy for the victims of terrorism. Of course, with any wide-scale attempt to fight terrorism there are bound to be a few cases of abuse of security measures. For example in the UK terrorism suspects were originally detained without charge under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act however the detention was declared unlawful by the law lords in 2005 so the government introduced new scaled back policies such as ‘control orders’.<a href="/print/17802#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Therefore government has always been willing to scale back its security legislation when the courts believe it goes too far. Nonetheless it is not a good idea to shut down all security measures under a pretext that they violate rights<a href="/print/17802#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.

                    <p>If there is even a slight injustice, then there is a problem worth addressing.

                    <p>The USA is at present far better than most countries in their respect and regard for civil liberties. New security measures do not greatly compromise this liberty, and the US measures are at the very least comparable with similar measures already in effect in other democratic developed countries, e.g. Spain and the UK, which have had to cope with domestic terrorism for far longer than the USA. The facts speak for themselves – the USA enjoys a healthy western-liberalism the likes of which most of the world’s people cannot even conceive of. The issue of the erosion of a few minor liberties of (states like the US’s) citizens should be overlooked in favour of the much greater issue of protecting the very existence of that state.<a href="/print/17802#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17802#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Zetter, Kim, ‘The Patriot Act Is Your Friend’, Wired, 24 February 2004, <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2004/02/62388" title="http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2004/02/62388">http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2004/02/62388</a>, accessed 9 September 2011</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

Because, deep down, everyone knows that it is simply a balancing of risks – in practice all the government is trying to do is save lives. It is of course, the government’s primary duty to protect citizens but this can only be done with the loss of some civil liberties. These liberties will of course still be completely protected by the courts.

                    <p>The threat of terrorism is greatly over exaggerated. Western governments all over the world are effectively selling the threat of terrorism to their citizens in order to increase their powers of control. The threat, however, has to be exaggerated in order for the electorate to believe that the security measures are needed. The motives of governments doing this vary; some just want the new security measures to make their jobs easier; others however, see it as an opportunity to increase state control and power over the average citizen. There is not enough evidence to show that terrorism has evolved into something more threatening since than it had been for several decades. For example there was the bombing of Pan Am 103 in 1988 killing 270 people or the 1983 bombing of the US embassy in Beirut which killed 63.<a href="/print/17802#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> While the scale is smaller than the 9/11 attacks they are just as terrible and were met with a much more measured response that did not involve infringing civil liberties. Governments are likely to take advantage of anti-terrorist mania and seize the moment to strengthen their regimes. Modern government bodies fighting terrorism are sophisticated enough to counteract terrorism with little use of 'draconian' measures. It is not acceptable to curb citizen rights because of isolated events.</p><div><a href="/print/17802#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> PBS Frontline, ‘terrorist attacks on americans, 1979-1988’, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/target/etc/cron.html" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/target/etc/cron.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/target/etc/cron.html</a>, accessed 9 September 2011</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Admittedly, extra-security measures do halt economic growth. But then again, so do a lot of things like inertia, or lack of consumer confidence. It is, however, a matter of degree; if the trade-off is between a lessening of economic growth and lives saved, then it is not hard to decide in which direction reason is behind. When lives are saved the economy benefits as those people will remain productive workers. And having lots of security is not all negative, the security business does very well.</p>        </div>
