    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes that God exists</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The question of God&rsquo;s existence forms a fundamental part of theology, philosophy, and life generally. Religion is one of the most profound and pervasive institutions, appearing in virtually every culture and in every time. Serious questioning of the existence of God has only become part of common discourse in the past three centuries, however, as state-sponsored religion and religious crimes have faded from the Western world. Increasing scientific knowledge has also led people to question belief in the existence of God. Since there are many arguments on both sides of the debate about God&rsquo;s existence, it is necessary to limit the focus of this discussion. This debate will therefore take place largely within the parameters of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), and will focus on the arguments for and against the Abrahamic conception of God.</p>

The world is awash with blood, pain, and suffering. No loving God would make a world so imperfect and troubled <sup>1</sup>.

                    <p>Evil may be thought of as the absence of good. It is a privation of goodness, just as darkness is the absence of light. God is good and the embodiment of goodness, but humans have been endowed with free will; they can make the choice not to follow the path of good. People have the ability to make both good and bad choices; if they did not then they would not truly be free. God’s greatest gift to humanity is thus also a heavy burden <sup>1</sup>. Many believe, also, that there are rewards for suffering in this world that will be repaid in the next. Most religions acknowledge a form of afterlife that will give justice to those who were the victims of wrongs in life. In the case of natural “evils”, like hurricanes and disease, people too often think their limited knowledge to be absolute wisdom <sup>2</sup>. It is impossible to know God’s will; God may work in mysterious ways, providing for the greater good of the future with perceived ills in the present.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Kekes, John. 1990.

                    <p>Physics and cosmology explain the development and evolution of the Universe and the bodies within it. Chemistry explains the interactions of substances and the origin of life. Biology explains the development of life’s complexity through the long process of evolution. God is a superfluous entity in discussions about existence; God is entirely unnecessary to human understanding <sup>1</sup>. At best, believers can point to various missing links in the explanations offered by science, using God to fill the gaps. The God of the Gaps is a weak God whose domain grows smaller each day as science progresses. Furthermore, there is no evidence of the supernatural existing at all, if that is what God is meant to be. The burden of proof in a debate concerning the existence of something is on the individual making the positive claim. In a debate about the existence of God, it is up to the believer to provide evidence for that belief <sup>2</sup>. The rational position in the absence of evidence is disbelief. If believers claim that God lives outside the Universe, or that God cannot be empirically identified due to God’s ethereal nature, then in truth they are saying nothing. Only the natural world exists because only the existence of the natural world can be demonstrated. The supernatural is pure fantasy.</p><p>1. Boyer, Pascal. 2001.

                    <p>Life goes on whether God exists or not. Theologians, philosophers, and laypeople have been fighting both in academia and on the actual battlefield over the question of God’s existence, yet in all the centuries no definitive answer one way or the other has been given by either side <sup>1</sup>. It seems that there is little value to belief one way or the other, so arguing for God’s existence is simply a waste of time. If God were proved to exist, or not to exist, little in life would change at all.</p><p>1.Borne, 1961</p><br>        </div>

                    <p>The question of God’s existence does matter, not only to those who believe, but to an understanding of life and its meaning. If there is a God who has a plan for humanity and the Universe, then in order to understand the plan and to become an active part in it, one must try to understand in some sense the nature of God. Though it is of course impossible for a human being to fathom God entirely, it is possible to understand some aspects of God. Without accepting God’s existence, this understanding can never be attained. To ignore God is to ignore the search for truth.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Many people do not believe in God, and the ranks of unbelief are growing every day, particularly in the developed world. It seems that as human knowledge of the Universe expands and as social institutions develop and improve, people feel less dependent upon the crutch of religious faith, and place greater store in reason <sup>1</sup>. If God existed God would make God’s existence clear to all humanity, not just to a chosen few. In so doing, God’s wisdom would naturally drown out an earthly knowledge, which would obviously be inferior to any that might be furnished by an omniscient being <sup>2</sup>. God has clearly never imparted God’s wisdom to people, since no such divine wisdom exists in any holy book. Were there a correct holy book currently in use, it would necessarily be the only one, because everyone would acknowledge its superiority at once.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Drange, Theodore. 1998.

                    <p>It is unreasonable to suggest that God must reveal Godself to humanity, or make God’s existence manifestly clear, because that would undermine the value of faith <sup>1</sup>. Belief is an important component of all religious teachings because it is what allows the soul to transcend the material world and to commune with the divinity. Without faith, life is meaningless. Furthermore, if God were to make God’s desires and commands known, then free will would be undermined. It is necessary to the exercise of individual human agency that God does not dictate every command. That is why God leaves life, at least on the surface, up to humans.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Maitzen, Stephen. 2006. "Divine Hiddenness and the Demographics of Theism".

                    <p>God is a logical absurdity, as demonstrated by empirical fact and rational reflection. Certainly God cannot exist outside of the Universe, as such a concept is effectively meaningless. In fact, physics explains that when the Universe expanded as an inflating field of space and time as the result of a quantum fluctuation, causality itself arose from the process, making a causative agent “prior” to the Universe not only unnecessary, but also impossible. Furthermore, the idea of an omnipotent God is logically contradictory because if God were omnipotent God would be able to create an entity greater than God, which is impossible <sup>1</sup>. The very attribute is logically unfounded, making the conventional explanation of God invalid.<br><sup>1</sup> Savage, C. 1967. "The Paradox of the Stone".

                    <p>Nature is marked by clear design. The complexity of the human body, of planets, stars, and galaxies, and even of bacteria attests to the existence of creative agency. It is impossible that such things as interdependent species could come to exist without the guidance of God <sup>1</sup>. Likewise, certain organisms can be shown to be irreducibly complex, meaning that if one were to remove any part of such an organism, it could not function. This refutes the gradualist argument of evolution, since there is no selective pressure on the organism to change when it is functionless. For example, the bacterial flagellum, the “motor” that powers bacterial cells, loses all functionality if a single component is removed <sup>2</sup>. Besides design, the only explanation of its development is blind chance, which seems less sensible, since in human experience nothing complex can come about without agency.</p><p>1.&nbsp;Ratzsch, Del. 2009.

                    <p>There is no design in the Universe. People tend to anthropomorphize their environment, trying to assign human-like qualities to animals and nature. All of the complexity in the Universe can be attributed to natural processes; the Universe, stars, and life are all the product of physical and chemical interactions. There is no mystery in the basic process. Furthermore, there are no irreducibly complex organisms. Every example offered by theists of irreducible complexity has been found inaccurate. The bacterial flagellum, for example, when several key components are removed loses its functionality as a motor, but becomes a form of secretory system that has a separate function<sup>1</sup>. Clearly, complexity is not indicative of a creator.<br><sup>1</sup> Miller, Kenneth. 2004. "The Flagellum Unspun: The Collapse of 'Irreducible Complexity'" in Ruse, Michael and William Dembski (ed.).

                    <p>Virtually every holy book is full of errors. They were often written long after the fact from second and third-hand accounts of the exploits of their subjects. This leads to the development of embellishments and legends, with the supernatural elements of stories always beginning to take precedence once all actual witnesses to events have died. Ancient holy books are nothing more than the moral frameworks of the time in which they were written. They are not transcendent in their wisdom, but very much a part of their time. This is why many of the moral sentiments expressed in such texts as the Bible are not practiced in Western states any longer, because to do so would now be considered morally repugnant. No one in Europe would consider it acceptable, for example, to stone someone to death for working on the Sabbath. Moral sentiment clearly evolves over time<sup>1</sup>. Holy books and prophets show no divine wisdom, which would have to transcend the time of writing and be applicable always.<br><sup>1</sup> McGinn, C. 1979.

The chemical composition of the planet had to be perfect for the development of life, as did its position of orbit around the sun, since if it had been slightly farther away it would have been too cold for life to develop, while it if had been slightly closer, it would have been too hot. Furthermore, the evolution of human beings, with free will and intelligence, was even less likely.
