    <h1 class="print-title">This house would assassinate dictators</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Assassination can be defined as the targeted killing of an individual for political reasons in peacetime. It can be undertaken by individual citizens, or by the agents of another state, but in either case it takes place without any legal process. Assassinating a dictator is often considered in the context of Hitler and Stalin, or of secret CIA action against foreign leaders such as Fidel Castro in the Cold War period (after this became public knowledge in the mid-1970s US Presidents have banned the use of assassination by Executive Order). However, this issue regained topicality in the 1990s as leaders such as Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic pursued bloody careers which threatened international peace. In recent years US airstrikes apparently aimed at killing Muammar Qaddafi of Libya (1986), Osama Bin Laden (1998) and Saddam Hussein (1991 and 2003) have provoked argument - were these assassination attempts or did these leaders have the status of enemy combatants in a time of war? Certainly the UN Charter (Article 24) and various conventions (e.g New York Convention) clearly appear to make assassination in peacetime against international law. Proponents nevertheless argue that assassinations are necessary for the greater good of preventing civilian suffering.</p>

                    <p>Assassination is likely to be counter-productive, rallying popular feeling around a repressive regime as external enemies or internal minorities are blamed, rightly or wrongly, for the act. This is even more likely to result from an unsuccessful assassination. Also, often the oppression of a people is widespread in the administration, therefore CIA attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro would have achieved little in the form of alleviating the suffering of ordinary Cubans.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Dictatorial systems are highly personal, so removing the driving force behind such a regime will result in its collapse, allowing a more popular and liberal government to replace it. Assassination of a dictator may be the only way to effect change in a country where a repressive police state prevents any possibility of internal opposition. Cowed populaces need a signal in order to find the courage to campaign for change. If there is no way to bring tyrants guilty of terrorising their own people to justice, then assassination can be justified. And the example elsewhere of assassinated dictators will act as a warning to would be tyrants in future.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The utilitarian justification for assassination lies in the many deaths and much suffering potentially prevented if just one man or woman is killed. The greater good demands a single evil act is done, especially if it would avert the immediate and certain danger of much worse evil. Oppressive, tyrannical dictators who sustain their own power through fear have no legitimacy. Who now wouldn't wish that Hitler had been killed in 1933? Or Pol Pot in 1970? The casualties directly inflicted as a result of their misguided policies could have been avoided. As a last resort therefore, assassination stands as a 'permissible means to a just end' <sup>1</sup>, handing the reins of the state back to its oppressed population.</p><p>1. Perry, D. L. (1995).

                    <p>There is little evidence to suggest that assassination on its own can prevent civilian death and suffering. In a National Bureau of Economic Research study, it was found there is good evidence that 'successful assassination attempts lead to increased intensity of existing moderate-level conflicts' <sup>1</sup>. Therefore, the assassination of a leader can serve merely to exacerbate conflict and increase the prospect of civilian harm. Though the assassination of Hitler in 1933 would undoubtedly have saved lives, there was no means to have predicted his future political or ideological path accurately enough to justify his targeted killing. The foreknowledge required for assassination to be used prudently is simply not accessible.</p><p>1. Olken, B. A., &amp; Jones, B. F. (2007, May). Hit or Miss?

                    <p>An alternative in the form of international courts now exists for bringing dictators to justice. The Special UN Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia has been able to put Slobodan Milosevic on trial in the Hague, and Saddam Hussein faced justice in Iraq. The International Criminal Court now provides a permanent forum for such action to be taken, and is itself a deterrent to would-be tyrants in the future. As there is a lawful alternative that shows international justice being done it should be used rather than stooping to the level of the dictators.</p>        </div>

                    <p>International Justice is very slow and only ever seems to catch up with dictators when they have already been forced out of power so are vulnerable.

                    <p>Sometimes dictatorship is preferable to the alternatives, especially for those outside the country itself. It has often been in the interests of the great powers to support autocrats who would promote their geopolitical interests in a way that a democratic regime would not, especially in the cold war period. Sometimes dictators have successfully held countries together which otherwise might have descended into civil war and ethnic strife. Events in Iraq since Saddam Hussein was deposed have shown that even worse violence and suffering can be unleashed if a strong hand is suddenly removed.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Dictators are a threat to international peace, not just their own people. Saddam Hussein's attack on Kuwait in the early 1990s threatened not merely innocent Kuwaiti lives but international access to Kuwaiti oil and its subsequent effects on markets. Furthermore, the tendency of dictators to attack other countries in order to divert attention from their unpopular actions at home means that assassination is also justified as a means of preventing a terrible war, which might rapidly become a regional or global conflict.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Armed invasions are costly events, in terms of the lives lost, the emotional trauma and the ever-widening hole created in the economy. Assassination provides a means to accomplish the goals of a military campaign without having to put boots on the ground, removing the predominant obstacle to democratic reform or energy security. As Angelo Codevilla argues, 'the military art consists of striking those people and things most likely to stop the enemy from continuing the war'<sup>1</sup><sup>.&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;As the Gulf War demonstrated, often the quarrel is not with a state but its leader and it would be 'futile and immoral to demolish a country in the hope that this will persuade the tyrant to give way'<sup>1</sup>. Furthermore, Ari Fleischer, a spokesman in the Bush administration when asked about the cost of a possible war with Iraq, remarked 'the cost of a one-way ticket is substantially less than the cost of war… the cost of one bullet, if the Iraqi people take it on themselves, is substantially less than that’ <sup>2.</sup>&nbsp;This admission belies the Bush administration’s belief that Hussein’s assassination would allow them to accomplish their objectives without a prolonged ground campaign.</p><p>1.

                    <p>Far from preventing the necessity of an armed invasion, an assassination attempt is an escalatory step that would risk the sudden outbreak of war, whether the assassination attempt was successful or not. If unsuccessful the dictator would undoubtedly retaliate. If successful the dictator's lieutenants may do the same or there may be chaos. In such an event, the effect of the assassination would certainly not be to cut costs but to draw the state into a potentially long, protracted and extremely costly conflict.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Dictators are a threat to international peace, not just their own people. Their tendency to attack other countries in order to divert attention from their unpopular actions at home means that assassination is justified as a means of preventing a terrible war, which might rapidly become a regional or global conflict. A study by Benjamin Jones and Benjamin Olken in 2007 concluded that 'assassinations of autocrats produce substantial changes in the country's institutions'<sup>1</sup><sup>.&nbsp;</sup></p><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nber.org/~bolken/assassinations.pdf">Olken, B.

                    <p>Dictatorships can be preferable for international stability. It has often been in the interests of the great powers to support autocrats who would promote their geopolitical interests in a way that a democratic regime would not, especially in the cold war period. Israeli-Egyptian rapprochement was only possible due to the hold Mubarak held on the Egyptian nation. Sometimes dictators have successfully held countries together which otherwise might have descended into civil war and ethnic strife. Events in Iraq since Saddam Hussein was deposed have shown that even worse violence and suffering can be unleashed if a strong hand is suddenly removed. Furthermore, when Israel's attempt to kill a well-known terrorist in Jordan failed and their assassins were caught, they were forced to give up the future founder of Hamas to get their men back <sup>1</sup>. In that case, the assassination attempt only served to fuel future hostility and instability in the region.</p><p>1.Sofaer, A. D. (2004, March 26). Targeted killing is a necessary option.

                    <p>If a tyrant comes to power by illegitimate, undemocratic means and directly suppresses, harms, and kills the citizens of a state, that tyrant loses all legitimacy to the continued occupation of office. If it is impossible to depose the leader by more subtle means of opposition and democratic voting, the only route to freedom may be assassination. In such cases, assassination is certainly justifiable, provided that as Dietrich Bonhoeffer points out, there exists a 'group capable of quickly occupying, or remaining in, the key organs of the totalitarian dictatorship' <sup>1</sup>. The assassination of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi would undoubtedly lead to the installation of a democratic regime with the full backing of the Libyan people, yet his fierce, paternal grip on the army prevents this from occurring.</p><p>1.

                    <p>Assassinations do not serve as a means to regime change. Rather they risk back-firing and the imposition of an even more repressive state run by a dictator understandably more fearful for his life than the fallen ruler was. He or she is then more likely to become more paranoid and take measures to strengthen his or her grip on power. Another result is that supporters of the tyrant may come out in support and unity behind a new leader, a leader that assumes the mantle with a vengeance. This would leave a people worse off as far as deposing their tyrant. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the CIA assassination plots were planned without 'any real consideration for the well-being of their intended victims...&nbsp;too often the death of a foreign leader was an end in itself rather than simply a possible outcome of a comprehensive effort to replace a bad government with one that respected human rights’ <sup>1</sup>. Assassination attempts, therefore, entail great risks of back-firing. If Gaddafi was assassinated with the rebels in no position to take over the result could be one of Gaddafi’s close relatives taking power and being equally authoritarian.</p><p>1. Perry, D. L.

                    <p>If we assume the role of executioner without the backing of law we are sinking down to the level of the dictators. Any new government founded upon such an arbitrary act will lack moral legitimacy, undermining its popular support and making its failure likely. Consider the long civil war in Rome after the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C, or the failure of the British Commonwealth after the execution of Charles I in 1649. Furthermore, assassination is widely defined as murder, and is prohibited in the United States by executive order for that reason <sup>1</sup>.

                    <p>Murder is justified when committed against those whom are deserving of no moral consideration. As such, if scruples over the morality of our actions prevent us pursuing a greater good, it will never be possible to oppose evil effectively. Dictators themselves ignore normal ethical standards and international conventions, so they effectively place themselves beyond the protection of the law. The alternatives to assassination would all leave a dictator in power for many years. In that time not only will many more people suffer under a repressive system, but the policies pursued by an out-of-touch and unrepresentative regime are likely to do serious (if unintentional) harm to the whole nation and its economy, making eventual rebuilding much more costly in both human and economic terms. As for the legal question, 'targeted killings in self-defense have been authoritatively determined by the (US) federal government to fall outside the assassination prohibition' <sup>1</sup>; 'the use of force in legitimate acts of self-defence does not qualify as assassination'<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>1.

                    <p>Who decides who deserves to be assassinated? Politics is not a black-and-white affair and states regarded by some as dictatorships are seen quite differently by others. The assassin in effect 'acts as prosecutor, judge, jury and executor combined'<sup>1</sup>. For example, Slobodan Milosevic could claim a popular mandate for many of his actions in the former Yugoslavia. General Pinochet in Chile seized power by force but later gave it up, allowing a democratic state to emerge. Many authoritarian rulers around the world today pay at least lip service to democracy, even if elections are "managed" and the possibility of real change is strictly limited. Even if we had the right to make judgements as to which leaders deserve to die, our decisions would be arbitrary and without widespread support.</p><p>1. Perry, D. L. (1995). Repugnant Philosophy.

                    <p>It is not important who decides who is assassinated, only that there are certain standards by which we can determine a dictator from an inappropriate or unfortunate ruler. Those parameters can be set multi-laterally to ensure fairness and complicity across the board. Generally speaking, tyranny and oppression are obvious wherever they take place. It isn't just how democratic a regime is, it is whether it uses its power to inflict great suffering upon its people or others, against all human rights standards. If leaders guilty of genocide or other crimes against humanity can be brought to account through the normal democratic process or the courts, then fine. But if they cannot, then their people have the moral right to take up arms against them. Sometimes this will mean assassination.</p>        </div>
