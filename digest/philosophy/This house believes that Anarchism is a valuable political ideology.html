    <h1 class="print-title">This house believes that Anarchism is a valuable political ideology</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Anarchism is an ideology that believes that the state is an undesirable and unnecessary. Whilst a &#39;descent into anarchy&#39; can be used in modern language to describe a decline towards a state of chaos, anarchists believe that a stateless society would be a much better place to live; they point to anarchist communes like Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen as places of peace and contentment free from the state.There are two ways to define this debate and I have tried to include both of them on this page, firstly one can talk about how anarchy is a worthwhile goal in and of its self and how a stateless world would be superior to the one we live in. Secondly it is possible to argue that Anarchism provides an essential voice in a world where people are much too keen to listen to and do exactly what the state tells them.</p>

                    <p>Anarchist groups are very naive in believing that we could survive without states, states provide a countless functions that would not exist otherwise. Things like the fire service would be very hard to organise as a community, it is likely that that very few people would volunteer to perform such a dangerous job. There are many vital services that require economies of scale to exist in order to provide the specialized services. This means that something larger than a local community is needed to provide it. For example communities could provide basic healthcare but could they provide the cutting edge research necessary to improve it, and then the expensive treatments to be able to take advantage of that research?</p><p>Legal systems are dependent on the state for their existence, without a centralised system of law and a state to appoint judges and organise and fund courts and the police. Under anarchy law and order is likely to look a lot more like mob justice. Without any sort of police force or judiciary it would be highly likely that a community would be able to prevent crime.</p>        </div>

                    <p>These could still be provided in a different way. These issues can be dealt with quite sufficiently within small communities, in the case of a fire people the whole community would likely assist in fire-fighting duties whilst equipment could be owned communally.</p><p>Anarchist communities do not necessarily have no rules, these rules can be adequately enforced by the community and the community can collectively decide what to do about rule breakers.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The state has, throughout history, been responsible for an immeasurable amount of violence and destruction. From ancient times where states were the primary instrument of enforcing laws so that people could keep slaves, to the actions of imperial nations like Britain, to the holocaust to all of the pointless wars fought throughout history, states have a long record of slaughtering and ruining the lives of countless numbers of their own and other states people. William Eckhardt estimates battle deaths since 3000 BC at 151million while Beer came out with a much higher figure of 1.1 billion battle deaths (NB both use dodgy calculations and of course in either case the total military deaths let alone civilian would be much higher).<sup>1</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These actions are always taken because they are in the interest of the ruling class, but the ruling classes are never the ones directly involved in these conflicts, they instead use the state as an instrument to coerce other people to fight their battles for them.

                    <p>Forcing people into community action, as the state tries to do, detracts from real community action. People naturally try to help one another out and do what they can for their communities but when the state tries to undertake this action itself it always wastes a huge amount or resources and sends the message that the job is done. In a stateless society people would know that they have a responsibility to care for their fellow man and take all the steps they possibly can to do so. This action will be more direct, enthusiastic and relevant than any taken by the government because those organising it will inevitably be in closer contact and have more of a stake with the problems they are trying to solve.</p>        </div>
