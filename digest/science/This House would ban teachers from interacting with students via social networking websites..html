    <h1 class="print-title">This House would ban teachers from interacting with students via social networking websites.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter are breaking down barriers between teachers and students, redefining the way they communicate and interact with each other. Both current and former students ‘friend’ their teachers on such websites, which often contain a lot of information on the private lives of both parties. Some educators have found such sites to be an excellent tool to reach out to students who might otherwise have difficulty speaking out in class or asking for help. However, parent groups, school administrators, and legislators have become concerned that unsupervised online contacts might lead to inappropriate relationships between students and their teachers, and even sexual abuse. A slew of sexual relationships between students and teachers led the state of Missouri to pass a so-called ‘facebook law’ against student-teacher interactions through social media and text messaging. Citing free speech, the law was successfully challenged by teachers unions as unconstitutional.</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

                    <p>According to Carol Shakeshaft an expert in sexual misconduct by teachers: “[e]ducators who use social media for personal and intimate conversations and contact are not much different from those who spend their time hanging out with students at the beach. You have to ask why a teacher would do this. The honest answer is that it rarely has anything to do with student learning.<a href="/print/17889#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>” Interacting with one’s teachers the same way as with one’s friends, sharing personal information, can only erode the respect and distance that a teacher needs in order to be an authority figure and a mentor for her young charges. Even if such ‘friendships’ were entirely innocent, they would still cast enough suspicion on the teacher-student relationship to put considerable strain on the teacher’s role as educator and their ability to do the job.</p><div><a href="/print/17889#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Shakeshaft, Carol. “Using Social Media to Teach: Keep it Transparent, Open and Safe.” <em>The New York Times. </em>19 December 2011. http://nytimes.com/schoolbook/2011/12/19/using-social-media-to-teach-keep-it-transparent-open-and-safe/</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>This law assumes the worst of teachers and frames all teacher-student interaction in a negative way.

It may be more appropriate to establish some guidelines for how to use such media safely and professionally, rather than banning their use altogether.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Social networking websites have proven to be particularly effective for child grooming by pedophiles<a href="/print/17889#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Teachers are already in a position of power and trust in the relationship with their students. Being allowed to communicate with students via facebook would greatly facilitate misconduct by a teacher who wants to start an inappropriate relationship with a student, by giving him virtually unlimited access to the students after school. In fact, many such relationships do involve some form of electronic contact1. By banning this form of communication, the law would make it harder for teachers with bad intentions to carry them through.</p><div><a href="/print/17889#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Choo, Kim. “Online child grooming: a&nbsp;literature review&nbsp;on the&nbsp;misuse&nbsp;of&nbsp;social networking sites&nbsp;for&nbsp;grooming children&nbsp;for&nbsp;sexual offences” <em>Australian Institute of Criminology. </em>2009. https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=250455</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Child grooming, and having a sexual relationship with a minor are already criminal offences. If that doesn’t stop a potential predator, breaking the ‘facebook law’ in the process is unlikely to. A teacher who intends to abuse a child will still find ample opportunity to do so. This law takes a powerful educational tool from the hands of good teachers while doing very little to stop bad ones from acting inappropriately.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is very difficult for a child to realize that he is being groomed; they are unlikely to know the risk1. After all, a teacher is regarded as a trusted adult. But, if the child is aware that private electronic contact between teachers and students is prohibited by law, the child will immediately know the teacher is doing something he is not supposed to if he initiates private electronic contact. This will therefore act as an effective warning sign to the child and might prompt the child to tell a parent or another adult about what is going on.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Many teachers have been using social media as an extension of the classroom, some of them setting up discussion pages, or allowing students to contact them about homework or things that they did not understand in the classroom, it allows the teachers to provide extra help whenever the student needs it. This keeps students interested and makes learning fun by using a tool that they are already fond of. The enormous success of tools like ‘The Khan Academy’, which uses youtube videos to deliver lectures to kids, is proof of that<a href="/print/17889#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. It also allows even those students who are too shy to speak out in class or ask for help, to participate3. Tools like facebook and twitter have the advantage of being ready-made platforms that lend themselves well to extending classroom discussions through groups, pages, pictures, and videos. Not all schools have access to the funding to set up such pages separately and not all teachers have the skills to create them. It would be a mistake for schools to dismiss their use and their value.</p><div><a href="/print/17889#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Khan, Salman. ”Turning the Classroom Upside Down.” <em>The Wall Street Journal. </em>9 April 2011. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704101604576248713420747884.html</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Even if this were a great educational tool, some kids may not have access to it. Poverty or a parent’s life style choice might leave kids without access to a computer or the internet, preventing them from joining into such online discussions. This might make them feel more isolated from their peers and leave them behind in their work. The classroom is a space where everyone can be equal and have equal access to learning. The internet may not provide equal access and may hinder some students as a result. The use of such resources may also be to the detriment of other more traditional methods. For example the teacher may feel there is less need to explain homework if anyone who has difficulties while doing the homework can simply ask over the internet.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Social media has become the primary way in which children interact with their peers. &nbsp;These interactions are largely unsupervised by any adult, and yet they have a fundamental impact on the development of the children involved. Adolescents use social networking websites to gage peer opinion about themselves which may subsequently influence identity formation<a href="/print/17889#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.

                    <p>This shift in the role of the teacher from educator to supervisor may actually negatively affect teachers. What if a teacher sees her students post pictures of themselves in inappropriate circumstances, drinking or smoking or scantily clad? What if she discovers cyber bullying? Does she have an obligation to intervene or contact the parents of the children involved? Might that do more harm than good? What if the teacher fails to act and a child gets hurt? Should the teacher be held professionally or legally responsible for that failure? Until clear guidelines are established on what exactly the responsibility of teachers would be in such a situation, the supervision of social media use by children should probably be left to parents rather than educators.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It would be difficult to find out whether a student and teacher have had contact over the internet. If a teacher were having a relationship with a student, and this law was in effect, both parties would try to conceal it from others and from the authorities. There is then a question about how the state would find out about such behaviour. Would the state be allowed to access private facebook accounts, personal computers, or internet service provider records to make sure teachers and students are not communicating with each other? That would constitute a serious intrusion and privacy violation.</p>        </div>

If suspicions arose that a teacher were breaking the law, as with all cyber-laws, the state could subpoena the information needed as proof. This law would work mainly as a deterrent for teachers to contact their students via social media. Knowing that they’d be committing an offence that could result in sanctions or losing their job, would be a strong disincentive against it.</p>        </div>
