    <h1 class="print-title">This house believes we should strive for immortality</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Immortality, living forever, has always been an ambition and goal for human beings throughout history. The concept is an inescapable part of the human condition &ndash; we are intelligent, mortal beings, for the present, and this fact of life has shaped everything we have created. Everything in human thought is shaped by the knowledge that we will die: our political systems, both at home and in government; our religious teachings; our moral codes, and our punishments for breaking them; our familial practices; our stories, our memories; the way we love and the things we love; the way we view our place in the universe and the way we relate to an infinite cosmos. The human perspective is a mortal perspective, but what if that changed?</p>
<p>At least in so far as beating ageing is concerned, modern science seems to be bringing us closer and closer to the situation where immortality is a possibility. If we reach this stage, if mankind reaches the position where immortality is within her grasp, should we reach out and take it? Would it be right to do this, morally? Of course there would be immense consequences if a stage of implementation were reached where some human beings simply didn&#39;t die: the problems, politically and economically such a large population would bring; perhaps great expense for some and inequality for all, as only some would be able to take advantage of the new technology. Of course, at the moment, the ethics of immortality are fairly fantastical and full of assumptions but this is only due to it being unlikely that anyone who is presently alive would be affected by the debate and the debated issue. But perhaps we should get the debate rolling to help our children&rsquo;s children decide, or even in the unlikely event that modern science makes a sudden great leap forward and propels us all towards immortality.</p>

                    <p>In our society, adults already oppress and undermine the values of young people, because adults are generally in positions of power and young people aren't. Immortality will mean that there are far more old people than there are young, as people will be living to more advanced ages and not necessary wanting to have children. Age and experience would to an even greater extent mean dominance in a hierarchy; people wouldn't be able to empathise with youth. We would become a stagnant society with no fresh ideas, or newcomers might even die out altogether and we would be left with only the same people, like a dying Internet forum.</p><p>Our whole notion of progress would change; a conservative mind-set in every part of life would inhibit cultural change – something too often taken for granted in our liberal, modern age.</p>        </div>

                    <p>This depends on the form of immortality. Immortality could mean indefinite cell replenishment that, if taken at a young age, keeps one’s mind and body forever young. In this situation, would one have a 'young' mentality due to the young brain and active, lively body, or an 'old' brain because of the many years of experience? On the other hand, immortality may make age irrelevant – a form of existence as information on a computer. Or humanity may start to value youth more if it is seen to be rare - we already value standards of beauty that very few humans can actually live up to.</p>        </div>

                    <p>In this mundane, restrictive consensus reality, there simply isn't anything interesting or satisfying worth doing for however many thousands of years we are expected to live. Our everyday goals – the pursuit of power, money etc. won't amuse us for that long. There won't be the need to protect family if they won't die either, relationships will soon become stale as people become bored of their routines with each other, nothing about life that was valuable because it was brief and fragile will be worth anything anymore. In a fantastical situation where someone becomes a God, or brought to life as the eternal guardian of some holy relic or the operator of the control systems that maintain the planet's atmosphere, this is different, but ours aren't the kinds of lives suited to immortality.</p>        </div>

                    <p>A thousand years ago we would have been dead by the time we were forty. Now, it is considered strange for someone to die at that age. Setting aside religion, we will find that any decision, mark or setting, any limit or law - moral or legal - on when we should die, is always going to be wholly arbitrary.</p><p>And so how can any justification be placed behind a possible limit to how long someone could live? Providing the science is there to allow people to live forever, how could any decision, as arbitrary as it would be, on setting an age someone would have to die at be justified? Admittedly there is no precedent in which to decide such an age, but this rules all the more in favour of foregoing the decision altogether. It seems that the arbitrariness of dealing with the issue can only yield one option: to forgo the issue at hand and let the march of science carry on.</p>        </div>

Just because something is arbitrary does not mean it is wrong.</p><p>What is wrong is the arbitrariness that would result from the propositions motion being held. The feature of these arbitrary results would be that some people and not others would be immortal. This is something that is wrong because it is arbitrary AND because we regard equality as a desired ideal, especially when it comes to mortality issues.</p>        </div>

In Japan, women now live to an average age of 86.4<sup>1</sup> whilst their counterparts in Somalia can expect just 50 years<sup>2</sup>. Immortality, however it is attained, will have a cost, some will be able to afford it and some won't. Death is the 'great leveller', it comes to everyone equally, and if there is such thing as immortality treatment, the difference between rich and poor will be so great we may even become two different species.</p><p>History has repeatedly shown us that when the differences between the haves and the have-nots become so great and politically salient, then uprising or conflict is sure to follow.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/01/japan-women-life-expectancy-rises"> McCurry, 2010, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/somalia_statistics.html#80"> Unicef,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Death is not the greatest leveller ever. Because the rich can die and then pass on their wealth to their children, the gap between the rich and the poor becomes greater. It is for this reason that we have so many debates revolving around inheritance tax<sup>1</sup>. One way to resolve the inequality would be to raise the inheritance tax to 100% as suggested in this debate. But hypothetically, immortality is in fact another way of reducing the difference. If the rich lived forever, then their wealth would be needed to sustain their own life. Therefore the wealth would not be passed to their children. If their children failed to make their own money, the wealth would have to get divided. As they lived forever and the family got bigger via more children being born the wealth would have to be split amongst more people. This reduces the wealth divide and therefore is completely ethical.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1602209/The-inheritance-tax-debate.html"> Thornhill, 2006,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p>        </div>

The issue would stretch to property rights and how we would house people; social security would have to change; would we not see the development of a power-holding elite, those able to afford immortality, who would be able to cope with the economic situation whilst the rest of the population, the mortals, were left to starve. How can we not say that as power shifts to immortals, that they would not take advantage of the situation and create a two-tier society not dissimilar to the slavery-based economies of the ancients.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Longer-lived species do not have as many children. Without the motivation of desperation (needing to leave a legacy for when we die) we will also start having a lot less children, which will cancel out the effect of people not dying. If this does not happen then the choice of pursuing immortality could also be coupled with child bearing restrictions like China's or even something more stringent.</p><p>As for the shift in economic power being immortal would supposedly confer, that is a different issue to what is being debated. It is for the government and its people to decide democratically how to legislate for and regulate the trans-humanist advance. Of course, in a democracy we will see the majority, most likely mortals, want strict regulation on the technology, therefore we would see a heavily regulated industry gradually move towards a more liberal one once more and more people become immortal – a self-adjusting, just system based on the original ideas of those who originally advocated a modern representative democracy.</p>        </div>

We work constantly to keep ourselves alive, by eating by staying safe; everything we do is aimed at preserving life. But we don't carry that principle into the specific study of immortality and the ethics of trans-humanism in general.

The pursuit of immortality by means of 'suicide' is usually discouraged and the antediluvian religions of yore that requested virgin sacrifices etc. are no longer relevant off the pages of history. A Hindu widow is expected to commit suicide or serve the gods till death; this custom (sutti) is fast disappearing because of Islamic and colonial influences in the subcontinent. Either way Hinduism promises a series of afterlives and therefore death is not the final death and therefore not really a move against immortality.<sup>2</sup> However, as suicide is discouraged by texts of the Abrahamic beliefs and one is encouraged to do everything one can to live on (murder in self-defence is pressed in most religious texts); contrary to conventional thinking, seeking immortality within this life is not unethical but religiously egged on.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2008/06/04/did-people-live-over-900-years"> Answersingenesis.org </a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://epiphenom.fieldofscience.com/2009/01/how-does-religion-prevent-suicide.html"> Rees, 2009, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span></p>        </div>

We are encouraged to employ various strategies to bring us closer to heaven/a better-next-life.</p><p>Religion is deeply entrenched in the war context. If a soldier dies he is honoured for fighting bravely and serving his Lord: the Lord. This act of bravery is selfless and humble whereas not going to war to kill or be killed is thought to be cowardly. The pursuit of immortality/longevity in this life at all costs is thus discouraged as, in this context it is cowardly, selfish and unethical.</p><p>All purely selfish pursuits are put down by religion. If you do everything you can to be immortal while others die around you, you are not doing anything moral.</p><p>Fasting, an act required, by most religions is a process by which you deny food/sex (the ultimate luxury?) for yourself to experience the pain of the deprived or less-fortunate. Deprivation and sacrifice to feel deprivation is considered ethical in religion; thus.</p><p>Suicide motivated by the "One less mouth to feed" logic, is the ultimate act of selflessness/sacrifice, it cannot be unethical.</p>        </div>
