    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes the ‘classics’ (Latin &amp; Ancient Greek) should be taught in schools.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Latin and Ancient Greek were once considered central to an academic education in many countries. Latin was the language of much academic discussion until the eighteenth century; it was used since it could be understood by all “educated” people. Latin remains the formal language of the Roman Catholic Church, and therefore the official language of the Vatican; it is not, however, used in everyday business. Modern Ancient Greek evolved from Ancient Greek, but the differences between them are very substantial. The official language of Greece was an archaic form of the language, closer to Ancient Greek, until 1976. It was then replaced with the Modern Ancient Greek of everyday speech.</p><p>During the second half of the twentieth century, Latin and Ancient Greek were marginalized in many school curricula: they are now rarely compulsory and most pupils do not have the opportunity to study them, especially outside the independent sector. However, classical languages are compulsory in some Italian State-run schools intended for those aiming for a very high level of education: Latin is compulsory in the Liceo Scientifico and both Latin and Ancient Greek are compulsory in the Liceo Classico.<a href="/print/17740#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In the UK, the AQA examination Board stopped offering examinations in Latin and Ancient Greek in 2006, although the OCR Board is continuing to offer examinations in these subjects.</p><p>Where Latin and Ancient Greek are taught in schools, the curriculum usually has two components, translation and interpretation. Translation involves learning the grammar and vocabulary of the languages, in order to translate written passages into one’s own native language. Sometimes, pupils are also required to translate into Latin and Ancient Greek; this requires a very high level of grammatical knowledge. Interpretation involves the critical study of excerpts from classical literature, usually in the original languages. Courses sometimes include an element of historical study of Ancient Greece or Rome. Since Latin and Ancient Greek are no longer in everyday spoken use, pupils are not usually taught how to speak these languages, or how to understand others doing so.<a href="/print/17740#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>One suggested model for teaching the Classics, at least in the UK, would be for all students to learn classics from the start of secondary school, but have the option to drop it voluntarily at a later stage, such as school Year 9 (age 13) when students usually choose which subjects they will do their GCSE’s in, in favour of continuing a separate language. They would be tested solely on their reading comprehension in relation to the classic texts.</p><div><a href="/print/17740#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Italian Education and Schooling in Italy (2011), Angloinfo: The Global Expat Network, <a href="http://rome.angloinfo.com/countries/italy/schooling.asp" title="http://rome.angloinfo.com/countries/italy/schooling.asp">http://rome.angloinfo.com/countries/italy/schooling.asp</a> (Last Accessed 06/09/2011)<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17740#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> AS/A Level GCE Qualifications: Classics: Latin-H039 H439 (2009), OCR (Oxford, Cambridge and RSA) Examinations Online, <a href="http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/type/gce/classics/latin/index.html" title="http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/type/gce/classics/latin/index.html">http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/type/gce/classics/latin/index.html</a> (Last Accessed 06/09/2011)</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-editors">

                    <p>Even if all subjects must show practical economic utility, the study of Classics is still justifiable. Translation of Latin and Ancient Greek teaches concentration, attention to detail and logical thought. Debates about the interpretation of classical literature develop the ability to think critically and to construct reasoned arguments. Familiarity with classical literature improves the ability to write clearly, concisely and eloquently. These are all skills valued by employers; people who have studied Classics have reached the top of politics, commerce, diplomacy and law.<a href="/print/17740#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17740#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Carlton College: Classical Languages: Why Study Classics?

                    <p>All these skills can be learned through the study of other subjects, including one’s own language and other foreign languages. These subjects also have practical utility in themselves, unlike Latin and Ancient Greek. The prominence of people who have studied Classics in positions of power is a result of their social backgrounds or inherent intellectual abilities, not a classical education. Most people who have studied Classics attended either private schools (implying that they came from a privileged background) or schools intended for the academically gifted.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The study of etymology is of purely academic interest. It is more efficient to learn what words mean than to spend time learning a whole new language in order to be able to work out what words are likely to mean. It is also more efficient to learn modern foreign languages directly, rather than to learn Latin and/or Ancient Greek first. Once one has learned one foreign language, it is comparatively easy to learn another, since one has developed the techniques for learning vocabulary and grammatical structures. The similarities between the Romance languages mean that one can just as easily use knowledge of Italian to learn Spanish as one can use knowledge of Latin to learn either of these languages. Pupils should learn grammar when studying both their own language and modern foreign languages. It is absurd to suggest that they need to learn a dead language in order to do so.</p>        </div>

It is wrong that the opportunity for such cultural enrichment through classical languages if often only available to those whose parents can afford private education.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The world is becoming ‘smaller’, is the popular way of describing how now all parts of the world rely on each other. It is more and more common that companies and industries have branches in a variety of countries (this relates to opposition argument two), and thus learning a second language gives students a better chance at employment. However, this is not the case with classical languages as they are of no use in business. Learning a modern language that is still spoken gives an access to a culture that we could not gain any other way, while the classics give us access to antiquity, this is at the sacrifice of understanding contemporary cultures that are parallel to our own, and this seems more important. Finally it is important politically, to encourage a combination of diverse cultures and ideas, hopefully to make a more peaceful and accepting world. Being taught a classical language means there is less space in the curriculum for these live languages (or other subjects).</p>        </div>

                    <p>With more and more people graduating from school with qualifications, and in many cases continuing and qualifying from ‘Higher’ educational facilities it becomes more and more important to give students qualifications that will make them stand out in the job market. For those who do not attend higher education it appears even more important that the skills they gain in school should be useful, rather than the impractical ‘dead’ languages of Ancient Greek or Latin. Therefore rather than focusing on these languages we should put emphasis on life skills or, as mentioned above, languages currently in circulation which will help young people find employment or gain skills.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The classical languages were influential for a long time because most medieval and early modern societies greatly respected authority and tradition, rather than original thought. Modern texts may be influenced by classical ideas, but are likely to be more worthy of study, since they can also draw upon subsequent thinking and discoveries. Moreover, modern texts can relate general themes (e.g. love) to the specific concerns of contemporary life. In any case, there are no objective criteria for deciding that one work is “better” than another: each reader must make his or her own assessment of this. If school pupils are to study texts written by classical authors, they can do so in translation: it is nonsense to suggest that schoolchildren will be analysing texts in such detail that the niceties of translation will make any significant difference. There is therefore no need for school pupils to learn Latin or Ancient Greek.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Works written in Latin and Ancient Greek (e.g. by Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero and Vergil) address issues fundamental to the human condition, such as love, death, politics, morality and adventure. These works have stood the test of time: they exerted great influence on western thinking for two millennia and remain widely read. This indicates that they are of great literary and intellectual merit. These classics texts have influenced many modern scholars, and therefore by learning the classics we can understand how current thinkers have come to their own conclusions. Few modern works are likely to endure so long; this implies they are of less merit. Time should therefore be devoted to studying classical literature. The subtleties of any text can only be fully understood if one reads them in the original; knowledge of Latin and Ancient Greek is therefore of great use.</p>        </div>
