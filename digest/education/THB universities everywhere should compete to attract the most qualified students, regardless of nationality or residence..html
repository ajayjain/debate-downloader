    <h1 class="print-title">THB universities everywhere should compete to attract the most qualified students, regardless of nationality or residence.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>It is interesting to note that the world’s best universities are also the most internationalized. Of course this is correlation and not causation but it does flag up some interesting issues. Part of the reason why Oxbridge and the Ivy League recruit so extensively overseas is, of course, because they can. They have the resources to offer scholarships to qualified students and the reputation to mean that those students would want to come. However, there is an interesting question as to whether or not the internationalization of education, in this case meaning universities appealing to students from around the world rather than setting up campuses overseas, in and of itself, is a good thing.</p><p>On the other hand there is the question of whether it is in the interest of governments to educate nationals of other states. On one hand, it could be argued, this is giving away a competitive advantage. However, opposing that view is the reality that many foreign graduates remain in the country where they studied or, at least, retain a great deal of affection for it.</p><p>This raises questions both for the host nation and the nation of origin. What are the implications of the best and the brightest of Latin America going off to study a Harvard or Yale – or for that matter the best young minds from the Commonwealth ending up in the ivory towers of Oxford and Cambridge?</p><p>This debate has implications in a range of policy areas ranging from immigration and educational policy through to foreign policy and trade. It also has cultural implications at the level of language acquisition and the balance between cultural understanding and cultural hegemony. This is particularly acute given the dominance of universities from the English-speaking world.</p><p>Opposition have a strong case in pointing out the brain drain effect on the developing world and the possibility of imposing Western cultural mores on their future leaders. However, there is also an interesting argument that this may be no bad thing. It may not be politically correct to say it but there is a reason why students are so keen to get into Western universities, there is more to a degree from, say, Oxford or Harvard than name recognition alone. The name recognition exists because of a disparity in academic standards.</p><p>The flow is not entirely one-way with the number of US students studying abroad tripling in the past two decades. Although their destinations remain dominated by Europe, especially the UK, this has been diversifying in recent years with 15 out of the top 25 destinations for US students being outside Western Europe in the academic year 2009/10. China made it into the top five (alongside the UK, Italy, Spain and France) seeing a noticeable increase on the previous decade with nearly 14,000 US students studying there as opposed to fewer than 3,000 in 1999/00<a href="/print/17967#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p>There are two factors that universities, inevitably take into account, in both their dealings with domestic and international students; whether that student makes the grade academically and whether they can afford the tuition fees. Entrance criteria are inevitably a balance of these criteria against each other – for example with universities offering scholarships or bursaries to students from poor backgrounds with outstanding academic merit but charging full fees to students with worse grades but healthier finances. It is also something of a misnomer to think of universities as monoliths in this regard, with different courses, faculties and colleges specializing in recruitment on the basis of quite distant weighting between these criteria. The question is whether Universities should be focused on recruiting those with greater ability at the expense of those with greater ability to pay.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17967#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://www.iie.org/en/Who-We-Are/News-and-Events/Press-Center/Press-Releases/2011/2011-11-14-Open-Doors-Study-Abroad">Institute of International Education. “Study Abroad Rose in 2009/10 With More Students Going to Less Traditional Destinations”.

                    <p>Once people leave compulsory education the relationship they have with the state changes dramatically. The state no longer has so great a duty of care. Their option, other than going to university, would normally be to get a job. In doing so they are in an open competition. It seems unreasonable that universities should not treat them in the same way as a company would. Universities, like companies, should therefore have to compete for the best academic talent and there should be a level playing field in this competition rather than setting quotas or giving a leg up for students whether it is for the poor or for those native to the country where the university is located.</p><p>Universities work on an international basis already with different specialisms, costs and reputations in international marketplace. This is simply the logical conclusion of that.<a href="/print/17967#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17967#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://www.iie.org/en/Research-and-Publications/~/media/Files/Services/ProjectAtlas/Project-Atlas-Trends-and-Global-Data-2011.ashx">IIE Global Students Atlas.</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The state has invested in the individual student and in the university as an institution, it is therefore a stakeholder. A university is, therefore in a significantly different position to a private company which is a more obviously independent actor.</p><p>Although universities do compete globally they also receive direct support from the state for at least some of their funding. Even in a rich university such as Oxford the state and tuition fees makes up 50% of the cost of teaching a student.<a href="/print/17967#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> &nbsp;As a result the state has both an interest and a right in ensuring that the university protects its interests first and foremost. The state in turn has a duty to the taxpayers who are, ultimately footing the bill. Even those universities that are self-funded still owe a residual duty to the state. To the extent that they benefit institutionally from the actions of even the most rolled back state in matters such as defence and transport infrastructure – not to mention the secondary education of the bulk of their students.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17967#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/vc/news/michaelmas10/">Hamilton, Andrew, ‘Termly message – Michaelmas 2010’, October 2010,</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>If universities are expected to become increasingly self-funding (in the case of many nations they already are entirely self-funded) it is unfair to restrict whatever advantages they may have to succeed. Equally those universities in a country which simply aren’t up to scratch should not be guaranteed the luxury of an inbuilt base of domestic students.</p><p>A free and open market would improve the education provided to student both domestic and foreign by refining the tertiary sector through competition. Those universities which are failing will have to improve standards if they are to retain their students.</p><p>At the moment foreign students often pay more, for example for 2012/13 entry into Oxford to do biological sciences overseas students pay £18550 while home students pay £9000.<a href="/print/17967#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> Therefore the real rate the university would charge if it was attempting to break even while making a level playing field for global talent would be somewhere between these two levels. As a result there will both be more competition to get into the best universities; so driving up educational standards among school leavers, and more among universities who will also be competition for the domestic market.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17967#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/feesandfunding/fees/information/universityrates/201213feerates/">University of Oxford, ‘2012/13 University tuition fee rates’, 7 September 2011</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The predominant role of tertiary education is skilling people for the workplace. This is done either through direct vocational training or the somewhat more pedagogical ‘shaping of the mind’. Universities also provide the setting for acquiring skills of socialization that allow people to function as independent citizens outside the family home.</p><p>Increasingly both that workplace and that socializing takes place in an international, globalized setting. As a result the greater internationalisation both of education and the wider social setting of the university will result in all graduates being better prepared to compete in the global labour market.</p><p>At the same time the nation will be benefiting in a similar way. If more international students are attracted to study in university then more are likely to stay in that country resulting in a larger, more knowledgeable workforce, something even countries that are usually against migrants want to encourage.<a href="/print/17967#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a><a href="/print/17967#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a></p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17967#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://www.calgaryherald.com/business/University+reaches+keep+foreign+students/6245836/story.html">Toneguzzi, Mario, ‘University reaches out to keep foreign students Graduates seen as part of labour shortage solution’, <em>Calgary Herald</em>, 3 March 2012</a></p></div><div id="edn2"><p><a href="/print/17967#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[ii]</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17204297">BBC News, ‘Immigrants ‘have to earn £35,000’ to settle – from 2016’, 29 February 2012.</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>A free market in higher education will inevitably result in large flows of people around the world – this may bring some benefits but governments also have to consider its negative implications. It is one of the primary roles of governments to control the number of non-nationals entering the country. This is for a number of reasons, partly this is done to protect the interests of their own nationals but also to take account concerns of national security. For example there were concerns in the UK in 2009 that terrorists could get into the country on student visas leading to a tightening of the rules.<a href="/print/17967#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> Similar worries would mean that governments would be unable to make the necessary relaxation of the rules to truly allow free competition for university places.</p><p>Assuming that the lion’s share of any change would be seen in students from the developing world studying in the developed world, all of the countries concerned already have problems with migrants ‘disappearing’ into the population.</p><p>Were universities to significantly increase this, there would, of course be implications both for the job market and for the threat from terrorism.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17967#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/apr/10/student-visa-terror-arrests-link">Laville, Sandra, Northn-Taylor, Richard and Dodd, Vikram, ‘Student visa link to terror raids as Gordon Brown points finger at Pakistan’, <em>guardian.co.uk</em>, 10 April 2009</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There are already laws in place to deal with both of these difficulties. If students are on a student visa they are, generally, not allowed to work. Equally there are security measures in place to prevent acts of terrorism.</p><p>The problems with non-nationals illegally entering the workforce is more easily dealt with in the case of university students as the university itself has reliable methods of knowing whether someone is actually acting as a student on the basis of whether or not work is being completed. On this logic countries would also have to seriously reduce tourism – a far more common method of immigrating illegally than student visas.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The main attraction of foreign students to universities is not the cultural diversity they represent but the revenue. It makes sense that universities where they can should make use of this revenue stream – this money can then be put to good use to make the university a better learning environment so benefiting all students. &nbsp;Having scholarships available to the brightest helps to mean that even while charging the highest possible prices the best will still be encouraged to the university.</p><p>The proposition wants universities to compete to attract the best students so must be willing to accept that many of the best will not be able to afford the cost even if it is set at the same rate as domestic students. While this creates level playing field it does not help the poorest. It is not even the most free market option as the ideal in any market is to charge everyone individually based upon what they can afford. Instead a system where there are differing fees and many scholarships means that it should be considered that domestic students be charged less on account of already paying for many of things that the university needs; research grants, infrastructure etc.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Charging lower fees for domestic students cannot be justified on the basis that they (or their parents) have already paid for much of the infrastructure that supports the university as if all universities were to follow a policy of charging the same to all students then then populations everywhere will be making some contributions in this way to the education of foreign students. &nbsp;While we accept that there will need to be some scholarships this should not mean charging some students large amounts more than other students who are academically on the same level but just happen to be a domestic student. Both domestic and overseas students should be subsidising those who can’t afford university no matter their nationality.</p>        </div>
