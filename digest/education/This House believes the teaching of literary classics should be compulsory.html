    <div class="print-content"><p>At a time when there is a common belief that the word as an art for is in decline, a question arises over what is being taught in schools and whether or not the &#39;classics&#39; - the works which have been canonised by English scholars and are widely recognised to be the best works of art in the English language, are still relevant to the children of the twenty-first century. &#39;English Literature&#39; as a subject in its own right has only been taught officially since 1828, when University College London began to offer alternatives to the long established curricula at Oxford and Cambridge<sup>1</sup>. Since that time, there has been some debate over exactly what should be taught, especially with the formation of a national curriculum in the UK in 1989 which stipulated compulsory teaching of &#39;English&#39;, though not necessarily literature, to GCSE standard<sup>2</sup>. The question also extends beyond what should be taught into how it should be taught and whether or not it will be taught at all in the future. Recent advances in technology and a youth culture that provides so many recreational activities has lead to reports of literature potentially becoming extinct in the future - the implications of this question of compulsory teaching therefore extend beyond the value of individual works and into the realm of the survival of an art form.<br />

                    <p>The fact that people are not reading as many of the established classics as they used to is often extended to suggest that the written word itself is soon to become extinct. An article on wired.com suggest that in fact, people are reading and writing more words than ever before, and that this is a direct result of the technological advances which people believe are stopping people from reading<sup>1</sup>. It is well known that the number one most &#39;gifted&#39; item on the massive online retail store amazon.com is their &#39;Kindle&#39; e-book reader<sup>2</sup>. It would seem therefore that concerns over the demise of the written word and the need for compulsory teaching of the classics is unnecessary, especially given that most of the literary canon is now out of copyright, and is as such free in digital form<sup>3</sup>.<br />

                    <p>The sheer volume of information transferred over the internet does not equate to a good quality of education or an understanding of the English language. Articles and updates online are generally short, and at best provide a summary of a work which is hardly an adequate way to study it. If anything, the massive increase in unedited written work on the internet cries out for the compulsory study of the classics - they provide a quality and structure that cannot be found online. The advent of e-book readers is indeed a positive thing in an age where technology is synonymous with the activities of children. These advances and changes in the way people read should not sideline the significance of the classics of English literature - indeed their increased availability should serve to boost a policy of compulsory teaching.</p>

                    <p>Literature isn&#39;t a static core of classic titles, but changes with fashion just as everything else does. How can there be a compulsory list of classics when scholars themselves cannot agree on what is the best English literature? There are no rigid qualifications for canonization, and whether a work will be canonized remains a subjective decision<sup>1</sup>. This therefore suggests that a wider selection of literature should be taught that shouldn&#39;t necessarily include the present classic titles. If in the majority of cases students do not enjoy a particular title then it should not be kept on syllabuses simply by virtue of it &#39;being a classic&#39;.<br />

                    <p>Regardless of what is the current fashion at a scholarly level, there has been very little change in what we consider to be the core canonical writers of English literature. The interpretations of these writers is what is liable to more widespread changes, but this is a positive result of the academic study of the works which can of course only happen if people actually read and take an interest in them. The compulsory study of these works does not eliminate everything else, it just ensures that the foundations for understanding the English language and its cultural history are in place, which itself will improve the wider reading which should be encouraged alongside the classics.</p>

                    <p>Forcing students to study a particular set of works would limit rather than understand their understanding of English today. In a period concerned with multiculturalism and the positive aspects of diversity it would surely be better to look at a broader range of works than &#39;the classics&#39;. At a time when there are fundamental issues with the linguistic integration of migrants into the UK it is surely more important to focus on ensuring people can speak and understand English rather than have a knowledge of the literary canon. The problem extends beyond the education system, as a report in The Guardian by Alan Tucket shows how the migrant women are being let down by cuts to the &#39;English for speakers of other languages&#39; program<sup>1</sup>.<br />

                    <p>Up to 2009, the percentage of students in England studying literature to General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) level had been declining year on year<sup>1</sup>. In 2010 there was an introduction of a combined language and literature course, although the focus remained more on the teaching of English as a communication skill rather than a cultural art form to be studied in its own right. This demonstrates the well known idea that league tables and passing exams is more important in the education system than the education itself, neglecting the fact that the study of literature requires and improves the basic literacy skills which are at the heart of governmental policy. In 2008, 37% of the poorest children did not take a literature exam, leading to the belief that the study of literature for an elite, depriving those who are perhaps most in need of the inspiration and applied study that reading literature provides. This conflict between the time and effort it takes to study the classics and the demand for assessment has been around for some time, and despite the repeated calls for change from previous poet laureates Andrew Motion and Michael Morpurgo<sup>2</sup> it seems that the education sector does not recognise how beneficial the study of these works is to children.<br />

                    <p>The reason why basic literacy is at the heart of the governmental concern is that it still isn&#39;t being taught to a high enough standard. Before being able to enjoy and properly understand the English literary classics a core understanding of how the language works is required. The problem is exemplified by the need to have marks available in all disciplines for the quality of English used in terms of spelling, punctuation and grammar and by the fact that business directors such as Tesco director Lucy Neville-Rolfe still complain of poor standards from school leavers<sup>1</sup>. Recent findings by the National Literary Trust show that an alarming number - 3 to for out of 10 children between the ages of 11 and 13 own no books at all<sup>2</sup>. This surely suggests that there is a deeper problem within the education system that means that when children reach their GCSE&#39;s they simply are not prepared to tackle the complexities of the classics.<br />

                    <p>Despite the obvious positives of teaching a variety of works in literature courses, the time constraints and pressures of constant examination mean that this is often impossible. As the director of The National Association for the Teaching of English Ian McNeilly said: &quot;For a teacher under pressure to deliver results there may be precious little time or inclination to study areas which are not for assessment&quot;<sup>1</sup>, so in this respect it is essential to ensure a focus on they core classics which are as we have established, regarded as being the best and most engaging way into the study of English. By focusing on the building blocks of English literary thinking, the door is left open for individuals both on their own and with the guidance of teachers to read beyond the classics and build their own interests from these accepted foundations.<br />

                    <p>By exposing children to a prescribed list of canonical works it would surely lessen the amount and diversity of things young people read. The logic of reading great works of the past leading to the desire to read other works (perhaps equally great) operates both ways. Why not allow for a number of variations according to choices by the students - if they are allowed to study and be examined on things they freely choose and enjoy, then surely it will have the same positive effect on their attitude towards literature. The fact that schools are so constrained by infrastructures imposed from above should also point to a more balanced system in which a broader range of topics can be explored, given that for the majority of people, GCSE level will be the furthest they take the study of literature in any form.</p>

                    <p>We refer to certain works as &#39;literary classics&#39; because of the recognition they have received from the academic world. This is a process which takes time, but more than ever before there is a widespread awareness and general consensus on what is meant by the term &#39;classic&#39; in this context. They are chosen because of their individual merits and influences on culture - the most commonly cited single writer being William Shakespeare. He is one of, if not the greatest writer in the English language, so the study of his works is surely essential to anyone learning English for themselves. It is often overstated how much of our current vocabulary we owe to Shakespeare, however the point remains valid that he forms much of the basis for the language we speak and write today<sup>1</sup>. To not study the his writing, along with that of the other great innovators - Chaucer, Milton and Dickens to name but a few, would deprive people of an understanding and awareness of their own culture, and also inhibit the integration of others into the English language and way of life. This issue is also not limited to the UK, as an article in the Boston Globe suggests that more than half of Americans aged 18 to 24 never read books for pleasure<sup>2</sup>. It is almost certainly the case that the compulsory study of certain works would change that figure.<br />

                    <p>Although the influence of the literary classics is undeniable, their significance is indeed often overstated. Language by its very nature is constantly changing and evolving both in a biological and cultural sense, and despite the fact that we may still use words invented by Shakespeare today, that does not mean that they necessarily carry the same meaning as they do in the context of his work. As such the teaching of said work is not actually essential to the understanding of the word, or of how to use it in modern contemporary society. In other English speaking countries like America, the classics do not have the same cultural significance or dialectic relevance to their society. Whilst the artistic merit of works such as Shakespeare may still be appreciated in such places, it does not seem right to impose them on people who would otherwise choose not to study them. The decision of worth by the academic world does not make any work by definition interesting, and although it would be undesirable to lose the cultural heritage, the choice of what to study would probably lead to greater interest in the subject, and by extension a greater genuine interest in the influence of these works.</p>
