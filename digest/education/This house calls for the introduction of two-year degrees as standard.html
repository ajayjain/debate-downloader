    <h1 class="print-title">This house calls for the introduction of two-year degrees as standard</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The length of full-time undergraduate degree courses varies from country to country, and may not be standard even within one education system. However, around the world four-year degrees are most common, with five years or more not unknown in countries such as Germany and Italy. England stands out as the main example of three-year degree courses, although within the UK Scottish undergraduate courses are usually four years in length and this is becoming increasingly common elsewhere in the UK. Since 1976 the private University of Buckingham in southern England has pioneered two-year undergraduate degrees<sup>1</sup>, but until recently this had little influence on mainstream higher education in the UK or elsewhere. From 2007 onwards the UK government began to re-examine the way in which university courses were delivered, funding pilot studies for two-year degrees in several universities. 2010 financial pressures on the UK education system have led to a wider debate on whether two-year undergraduate degrees would be better for both students and the taxpayer.</p>
<p>This case presents the arguments for shorter undergraduate degree courses with the UK debate in mind &ndash; this would mean a reduction of most undergraduate degrees from three years to two. However, the arguments could equally well apply to other countries, where proposals may be for a decrease from four or five years to three. This may be particularly relevant to continental European universities, as the Bologna process<sup>2</sup> by which European higher education will be harmonised towards a standard three-year Bachelor degree will affect them over the next few years.</p>

                    <p>Universities are now under what is perhaps the most serious financial pressure they have ever faced<sup>1</sup> - the UK government for example is cutting spending on education by up to 25%<sup>2</sup> and allowing universities to charge higher tuition fees. Shorter degree courses will help to address these great pressures on all higher education systems. By moving students through university more quickly, they free up capacity so that the increasing demand for higher education can be met within existing resources. And as tuition fees rise in the UK<sup>3</sup> and many other countries as a consequence of government funding cuts, students will benefit from shorter courses that will allow them to graduate with less debt.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13387242"> Sharp, 2011,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10378384"> Richardson, 2010, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span><br><sup>3</sup> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14111421"> Richardson, 2011,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Higher education systems are under pressure at present, but shorter degree courses will not fix the problem. First of all, additional teaching weeks are not cost-free as academics will demand more money for their increased work-load and many of the resources used in a degree course (e.g. books, field visits, chemicals) will be the same regardless of how the teaching is scheduled. The University of Buckingham makes shorter courses work by charging more for lower tutor-student ratios, which implies increased costs if this were scaled up over the whole country. In addition, many poorer students part-fund their degrees by working for 20 weeks or so in their vacations<sup>1</sup>, so increasing their term lengths may actually force them either to take on more debt than at present, or deter them from pursuing higher education in the first place.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-10683825"> BBC News, 2010, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>This could result in institutions failing to attract vital international students as well as reducing the value of British degrees should people look for employment abroad<sup>1</sup>. The Bologna process of harmonising higher education systems across Europe has many benefits, among them increased opportunities to study abroad, either for the whole or for part of a degree. It will also ensure all degree qualifications are seen as credible by international employers, and make it easier to apply for and undertake advanced study beyond undergraduate level. English and Welsh universities already have work to do to ensure their three-year courses meet the Bologna standards (many are increasing courses to four years). Adopting a two-year course structure will effectively remove the UK from the Bologna process, denying its students the benefits and weakening the UK's ability to market its degree courses to international students.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/aug/03/vince-cable-two-year-degrees"> Swain, 2010, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>This arguments suggests that even the differences between the UK and European systems now would have a serious detrimental effect on the prospects of UK graduates. As this is evidently not the case, why do we need to adopt a blanket system that is not necessarily suited to the specific needs of the country, and more importantly not suited to the needs of our students. A Parliamentary discussion on the introduction of the process asserted that Britain already has "a global reputation for high quality</p><p>HE provision maintained by a well-developed and independent quality assurance system"<sup>1</sup>. It is second only to the United States in attracting foreign students to study, so assuming that bringing the system in line with other European countries will improve it is illogical, and may in fact take the unique edge away that attracts so many to UK universities.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmeduski/205/205.pdf ">House of Commons Education and Skills Committee, 2007, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span>(p. 24)</p>        </div>

                    <p>Universities are designed to be places of both education and of research. Students gain hugely from being taught by academics who are themselves engaged in pushing back the frontiers of knowledge while society gains culturally and economically from the discoveries and insights produced by universities. At present this is possible because teaching only occupies about half the university year, allowing academics to maintain a serious programme of research. This research also makes up an essential part of university funding, as they are given grants based upon the quality of their research<sup>1</sup>. By compressing undergraduate courses by increasing the number of teaching weeks threatens to disrupt this balance and harm the quality and quantity of research, especially given the significance of this research as regards the ranking and funding universities receive<sup>2</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/research/funding/"> Higher Education Funding Council for England, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/dec/16/research-assessment-exercise"> Lipsell, 2008, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Although the amount of time available would be reduced by a shorter degree system, the financial savings made by increased efficiency would most likely cover the gap from research funding, or at least allow universities to take on more staff to conduct research. Beyond this we must also consider that the role of university may be changing - with the privatisation of many universities seen as almost inevitable<sup>1</sup> - the "Universities White Paper" published by the government confirms movement in this direction<sup>2</sup>. As such, universities will have to perform well in research assessments in order to attract what will essentially be 'customers' - the students of the future.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/30/highereducation.uk4"> Curtis, 2002, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13939525"> BBC News, 2011, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>If modern students are not up to the demands of higher education, they should not be going to university in the first place. The over-expansion of higher education in the last twenty years has inevitably lowered standards among undergraduates<sup>1</sup>, as well as imposing greater costs on taxpayers. A two year system would undoubtedly be more intensive, and come with considerably less time off than the current system. This would most likely discourage those who see university as simply 'something to do before getting a job', thus increasing the value of a degree once more.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/7399488/University-targets-have-devalued-degrees.html"> Paton, 2010, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[13]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Suggesting that reducing the number of years for degree courses implies that currently all courses are too easy and give students too much time to do the work required. Of course this is not the case - achieving top marks in most courses is still very difficult, and reducing the amount of study time would inevitably inhibit the ability of students to study beyond the basic parameters of their course, which is a key part of university education. Geoffrey Alderman argues in The Guardian that there are many other problems with the current system which are unrelated to the number of students going through it, including the modern fixation with league table results. He argues that is is this "toxic combination of factors" that needs to change, and reducing amount of time spent at university will not affect them<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/10/universities-standards-blair-target"> Alderman, 2010, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Those who left school at 16 or 18 but now want to go to college are often more serious about their studies, often with a more motivated and professional approach than 19 or 20-year-olds who have moved to university by default. We should seek to encourage such committed students, who often contribute a great deal to society and the economy upon their graduation. But mature students want focused, cost-effective courses that do not require them to take three or more years out of a career. For example, at Stafford University where 2-year courses are being trialed, Director for Academic Development Dr Steve Wyn Williams has said that "Many of our students who opt to do the fast-tracks are mature students who are looking for a career change who are often quite used to working during the summer period when they were in employment"<sup>1</sup>. It would seem then that the introduction of such courses would encourage more mature students to get better qualifications, and in the process be able to contribute more to the economy as well as learn more for themselves.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/stoke/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9080000/9080029.stm"> BBC News, 2010, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[15]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Making such significant alterations to the education system in order to better accommodate one (fairly minor) subset of students seems a little extreme. A study in America showed that mature students over the age of 25 accounted for 36% of the total number of undergraduates<sup>1</sup>, and although this is a significant proportion, it is nowhere near enough to consider changing the entire university structure. In the UK the number of mature students may be even less, with 30% at Oxford Brookes classified as mature<sup>2</sup>, and only 14% at University College London<sup>3</sup>. Beyond the simple case of numbers, it is also important to consider that even in the mature section of students, shorter degree courses will not necessarily be better. Part-time courses and training for those already with careers are also widely available.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications/files/Nontraditional-Students-Facts-2011.pdf"> Center for Postsecondary and Economic Success, 2011,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[16]</span><br><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.brookes.ac.uk/facts/mature_students"> Oxford Brookes University,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[17]</span><br><sup>3</sup> <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/undergraduate-study/application-and-entry/mature-students"> University College London, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[18]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Part of the student experience is the opportunity to take part in a wide range of extra-curricular enrichment activities, such as sport, politics, reading groups, creative or charitable projects and even debating. Not only are these valuable in their own right as part of the wider education of a young person, they also provide opportunities to develop leadership abilities and other skills of great value to employers and society as a whole, according to research by the Montana State University<sup>1</sup>. And extra-curricular activities bring students from different disciplines into contact with each other and so broaden academic horizons. If a more intensive degree-course is to be adopted, such enrichment opportunities will often be lost to the detriment of both the student and society.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.googobits.com/articles/436-the-importance-of-extracurricular-activities-in-a-students-life.html"> 1 Sweeney, 2005, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[19]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Enrichment opportunities are still possible within a shorter degree course – the students spend no less time at the university than they would on a traditional course, it is just spread over two years instead of three. Arguably two 40-week academic years allow students better opportunities to cooperate with their fellows, as projects and planning are not constantly disrupted by long breaks. In any case, although some undergraduates do very worthwhile enrichment activities, it is not an area that would detrimentally affect the vast majority of students, who would of course still be able to do at least one or two activities outside their studies anyway. It has also been suggested that in the current economic climate, getting a part time job during university gives better graduate prospects than joining clubs and societies<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Quinn, 2002, <a>http</a><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">://</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">www</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">.</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">guardian</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">.</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">co</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">.</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">uk</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">/</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span>education<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">/2002/</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">oct</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">/19/</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">students</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">.</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">schools</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">1?</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">INTCMP</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">=</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/oct/19/students.schools1?INTCMP=SRCH">SRCH</a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Outside England, the broader education provided for 16-18 year-olds requires a longer undergraduate degree. In the USA and most European countries (including Scotland) a wider range of subjects are studied to 18<sup>1</sup>. This produces better-rounded individuals than the narrow A-Level system and ensures that decisions made at the age of 15 don't limit academic and career choices later in life - many young people have voiced concerns over the growing significance of their A-level choices over their potential to get into university<sup>2</sup>. In such systems the first year or two of university typically involves studying a range of sujects before choosing a major discipline to specialise in for the final two years of undergraduate study.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.ibo.org/"> International Baccalaureate, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[21]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/feb/01/a-levels-university-places"> Tobin, 2011b,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[22]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>In general, countries with a broader, less in-depth education system up to degree level do have longer degree courses to compensate for this. In Britain young people are encouraged to specialise at A-level, and although in some cases this limits those who are still uncertain as to what they want to do, for many it is the ideal way to begin specialising in the subject they enjoy. Furthermore this means that they are better prepared to take their chosen subject to the next level and should not require the extra time often used at university level getting all undergraduates of the same year to the same basic standard. Top ranked universities often require this level of commitment to the subject, demanding specific A-Levels and the highest grades for competitive courses<sup>1</sup>. Given this level of specialisation the system creates before university, it follows that students in the UK should be able to cope with a more intensive and fast paced degree course in their chosen subject.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/feb/01/university-preferred-a-levels?intcmp=239"> Tobin, 2011, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[23]</span></p>        </div>
