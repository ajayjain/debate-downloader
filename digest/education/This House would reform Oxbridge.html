    <h1 class="print-title">This House would reform Oxbridge</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The universities of Oxford and Cambridge, sometimes known collectively as &lsquo;Oxbridge,&rsquo; have for many centuries been seen as the pinnacle of higher education, both within Britain and across the globe. Yet for the eleven or so centuries they have been in existence, many claim, Oxford and Cambridge have been marked by exclusiveness as well as academic proficiency, with their high entry requirements and old-fashioned practices still favouring those from more privileged backgrounds and excluding, intentionally or otherwise, promising individuals from marginalised areas and difficult backgrounds.</p>
<p>Both universities demand that most candidates sit a series of two and three-day interviews, often accompanied by entrance examinations. Although demands have been placed on Oxford and Cambridge by previous British governments to admit higher numbers of students from poorer backgrounds, there is no doubt they are still made up largely of students from independent schools.<a href="/print/32832#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Oxbridge admissions tests often valorise a form of self confidence and an approach to acquiring knowledge that most state-school pupils aren&rsquo;t coached in. Private schools, however, devote far more resources to preparing their pupils for the two universities&rsquo; entry systems. Many spend years gearing children up for the interview process, and so often produce people who can shine in the interview scenario, but aren&rsquo;t necessarily the country&rsquo;s brightest or those who have worked hardest. It is often argued that 17-year-olds from comprehensives will rarely have had the same intensive training, and so the admissions process inevitably excludes many of the brightest but least well-off pupils.<a href="/print/32832#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>Many from Oxbridge go into high-powered jobs in politics, the media and the private sector, leading reformists to argue that the most influential circles of society remain the preserve of the wealthiest, yet not necessarily the most intelligent or able. Owen Jones, the prominent blogger and polemicist, claims that merely carrying the &lsquo;Oxbridge&rsquo; stamp means candidates are assumed to be more intelligent than non-Oxbridge counterparts. Therefore students from Oxbridge are given priority in the market for jobs. There is much to suggest that this diminishes the status comparatively of degrees gained by graduates at lower-ranking universities, and a result keeps them out of the best industries.<a href="/print/32832#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;In academic fields, it has also been argued that Oxbridge imposes a monopoly on knowledge, stultifying debate and harbouring an innate conservatism which means that research from &lsquo;lesser&rsquo; universities are not given the same attention or weighting &ndash; a point which will be explored further in the substantive arguments below.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lsquo;Reform&rsquo; in this context means the model proposed by Owen Jones. The university buildings would be maintained, but many of Oxbridge&rsquo;s more arcane practices would be forcibly abolished.<a href="/print/32832#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Interviews of the type that the university has previously conducted would be allowed only for courses like medicine, in-keeping with the practices of many other universities.</p>
<p>Quotas for pupils from state schools would be enforced as opposed to just recommended, with the universities required to reserve 80% of their places for the brightest state-school pupils. This would be much closer to the proportion of private vs. state schooled pupils as state-educated pupils make up close to 93% of the school-age population.<a href="/print/32832#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> Oxford and Cambridge would still be allowed to demand people achieve the highest grades possible to gain entrance, and given the high level of demand that exists per place at each of the universities<a href="/print/32832#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> it should still be possible for both to only take in students of the highest academic calibre.</p>
<p>It cannot be ignored that a potential exodus of good teaching and research staff could occur if the universities were to be changed so radically. Therefore pay incentives would be offered to prevent top academic staff from leaving over fears about the implications of the proposed changes. The universities would be allowed a five-year changeover period in which to implement the reforms.</p>

                    <p>The current Oxbridge system is, by its very nature, unequal and elitist. The entrance exam and lengthy system of interviews are far more suited to schools that have the resources to prepare their children for them.</p><p>Passing the interviews requires a staggering degree of innate talent or years of training in productive academic techniques such as debate, critical thought and the ability to read and research independently. This is an approach to education which schools in deprived areas, trying to motivate kids from sometimes very difficult backgrounds, do not have the time or money to take up. This was shown recently by a report from the Office of Fair Access, which stated that the proportion of students from low-income families (defined by OFFA as those from families with an income of less than £15, 200 per annum), admitted by the universities has dropped since 1996.<a href="/print/32832#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>The brightest individuals are therefore kept out of the best institutions – a situation which dampens aspirations among the majority of Britain’s school-children and maintains a harm, in that those with the greatest potential and the strongest work ethic do not have an equal chance of being admitted to Oxford or Cambridge.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/32832#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Lee Elliot Major, ‘The simplistic solution to Oxbridge elitism won’t work,’ The Guardian, 28 May 2010 - <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/may/28/fair-access-oxbridge-social-elite">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/may/28/fair-access-oxbridge-social-elite</a> (accessed 4 January 2012)</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is the education system that is at fault.&nbsp;It is a fallacy to assert that Oxbridge is nothing but a gateway to membership of the ruling classes.

Therefore it’s arguably state schools that need to be reformed, not Oxbridge. Furthermore, the maligned entrance interviews can work to iron out biases in A-Level grades by allowing tutors to let candidates demonstrate skills and potential in other ways more suited to their personalities.<a href="/print/32832#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Abolishing interviews could therefore risk scuppering the chances of bright children who went to under-performing schools gaining access to an Oxbridge education.<a href="/print/32832#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/32832#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> University Guide 2012, The Guardian, 17 May 2011 - <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/table/2011/may/17/university-league-table-2012">http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/table/2011/may/17/university-league-table-2012</a> (accessed &nbsp;9 January 2012)</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/32832#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> ‘In Defence of Oxbridge,’ Latte Labour, 4 June 2011 - <a href="http://lattelabour.blogspot.com/">http://lattelabour.blogspot.com/</a> (accessed on 6 January 2012)</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/32832#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Richard Lowe, ‘Why we shouldn’t abolish Oxbridge,’ Independent Thought, 1 June 2011 - <a href="http://www.independentthought.co.uk/?p=1453">http://www.independentthought.co.uk/?p=1453</a> (accessed 4 January 2012)</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Far from being swaddled in privilege, Oxbridge students are forced to work extremely hard. Making the universities more like mainstream institutions or former polytechnics would reduce the workload, relax the pressure and ensure some of the country’s top students are not pushed hard enough. This could lead, in turn to a flight of the best students overseas to places like Harvard. This has been the case in France, where universities in recent years experienced an exodus of the country’s best scientific academics to the USA.<a href="/print/32832#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Similarly, South Africa’s universities have suffered from many potential students and academics going overseas – leading to an increasing skills deficit.<a href="/print/32832#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>The unique, driven approach offered by Oxford and Cambridge’s curricular and tutors has previously served to draw many overseas students to England; if the resolution were to pass, the reverse would become the status quo. Cost and national borders are rarely a deterrent to sufficiently talented pupils.</p><p>This will then have a knock on effect as talented UK students who chose to study at Harvard, McGill, Monash or Utrecht might also be drawn away from the UK economy. The social and academic networks that students form during their time in university, along with the internship schemes they participate in often direct them toward employment with particular companies and in certain jurisdictions. A student who graduates from an American law school will be much more likely to seek employment with an American law firm.</p><p>Love it or loath it, a place at Oxford is an achievement that many people at home and abroad aspire to and see as the pinnacle of success. It is conceivable that Britain would thus suffer a ‘brain-drain’ and reduced dynamism in its industries if Oxbridge was streamlined, potentially affecting long term economic growth, innovations in academic research and the development of new businesses.<a href="/print/32832#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/32832#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Maia de la Baume, ‘French Fear ‘Brain Drain’ to the US,’ The New York Times, 21 November 2010 - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/world/europe/22france.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/world/europe/22france.html</a> (accessed on 25 July 2012)</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/32832#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> ‘Brain Drain: How our thirst for academic talent hurts the rest of the world,’ Good Education, 21 June 2011 - <a href="http://www.good.is/post/brain-drain-how-our-thirst-for-academic-talent-hurts-the-rest-of-the-world/">http://www.good.is/post/brain-drain-how-our-thirst-for-academic-talent-hurts-the-rest-of-the-world/</a> (accessed on 25 July 2012)</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/32832#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Daniel Knowles, ‘Abolish Oxbridge?

                    <p>The great conceit of those who support Oxbridge is that the students that go there matter more than the institutions and their respective ���brands” do. Students from Oxbridge are simply too few in numbers to have any great impact on the UK’s economy if they decided to go overseas to be educated. Forcing Oxbridge to adopt a reformed and updated model of learning would reverse the regressive and dated idea that Oxbridge students are more intelligent and valuable to the nation’s future than they really are. Such an attitude needs to change if the vast majority of the country’s graduates have a chance at success.</p>        </div>
