    <div class="print-content"><p>A faith school is a school that is run by a religious group, such as the Catholic church. In the UK and many other western liberal democracies, the status quo is that some state schools are allowed to be faith schools in exchange for a small financial contribution towards the running of the school by the religious group running the school. The religious group also has control over how many and which children it admits, including the freedom to ensure that the majority of its intake is of its faith. They must follow the national curriculum but there is a lot of scope for including their own values in the education they provide. In this debate, the proposition wishes to completely remove faith schools from the education system.</p>

<p>Since education is something that the state is obligated to provide, any organisation that provides education is a representative of the state, even in private education. If religious groups are allowed to run schools then this means they are acting on behalf of the state, which undermines the separation of religion and the state, which the proposition believes is inherently harmful and undermining to the concept of democracy.<a href="/print/18368#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp;Even the Archbishop of Canterbury believes having greater separation of church and state would be beneficial arguing &quot;I think that the notion of the monarch as supreme governor has outlived its usefulness.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18368#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This separation has to include the education of children.</p>

<p>The state should not allow the education of a child to be polluted by what is tantamount to brainwashing. Amartya Sen argues &ldquo;Under this system, young children are placed in the domain of singular affiliations well before they have the ability to reason about different systems of identification that may compete for their attention.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18368#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Instead they have to learn about all religions to encourage tolerance.</p>
<p>It is totally acceptable for children to have religious education outside of school and to brought to places of worship but school is a place of education and they should be given an education that is not tainted by trying to ensure that they grow up with a certain attitude towards their religion.<a href="/print/18368#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>At the age at which children are sent to faith schools, they are too young to have decided their religion for themselves, and so, their parents must have decided it for them. The proposition accepts that parents have a right to decide a child&rsquo;s religion on its behalf but this means that faith schools end up segregating children based on the faith that they inherit. School should be about bringing children together not segregating them. In the UK the government allows faith schools to ask for confirmation of attendance at a relevant place of worship<a href="/print/18368#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp;which is inherently discriminatory and divisive. Proposition believes that separating children based on what families they are born into creates communities which find it difficult to associate with people from outside their community and therefore cause massive divisions in society based on what religion people were born into. <a href="/print/18368#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

<p><strong>Faith schools create a sense of community. </strong>This entire argument is based upon the fact that faith schools create a close sense of community within the school themselves. The opposition does not accept that this is harm and firmly believes that anything that creates a close sense of community is a force for good as it creates more accountability for actions within the community and a better support system in the case of anything going wrong.<a href="/print/18368#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

<p>When the government allows religion to act on its behalf, it confuses the role of the state and the role of religious groups. As it stands, religious groups do not appear to be truly answerable to the state and, therefore, it is unclear whether they or the government are the higher authority.<a href="/print/18368#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> For example in the UK faith schools set their own admission standards and increasingly have control over their curriculum, which in other state funded schools is set by the government, as well as they are being converted to academies.<a href="/print/18368#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> &nbsp;This legislation would make it completely clear that the state is the ultimate authority.</p>

                    <p><strong>Insulting to religion. </strong>This legislation is not simply a message to organised religion telling them that they are not a higher authority than the state; it is a message saying that the state does not believe they are capable of running schools. This serves only to worsen the state&rsquo;s already fractured relationship with organised religion and cause severe problems in dealing with large religious groups, who undeniably have a lot of power and influence.</p>

                    <p>Faith schools continuously perform better than normal schools. This creates a feeling amongst parents and children of wanting to be included in these faith schools. They are, however, excluded on the basis of their religion. This will create feelings of unfair exclusion, which will lead to animosity towards the religion running the school and, by extension, people of that religion.<a href="/print/18368#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp;As a result of this 64% of people in the UK believe that there should be no state funding for faith schools.<a href="/print/18368#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

<p><strong>It would be easy to convert faith schools to normal schools.</strong></p>
<p>	The majority of faith schools are already tied closely to the state education system making it easy to convert them into normal schools which are not faith based. Much of the curriculum is the same or very similar so the change would not be difficult for teachers. In England for example there 6783 faith schools that are also state schools and 47 that are academies.<a href="/print/18368#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> These schools would simply change to having the same systems as any other school and admission would become open to all.</p>

                    <p>To be encouraged not banned. The idea of closing down schools because they are performing better than other schools seems ridiculous. Rather than banning faith schools so all schools are on an even, but lower, playing field, a logical course of action would be to try and determine exactly what it was about faith schools that made them perform so well and attempt to emulate that in ordinary schools to improve their performance.</p>
<p>It may be possible to convert the schools but they would loose their ethos. Without these schools religious ethos their standards would slip and the students would be worse off.</p>

The fact that faith schools perform better than ordinary schools is an advantage only for the children who are lucky enough to attend.

This resentment grows into a general feeling of animosity towards the religious group running the school and to religion in general.
