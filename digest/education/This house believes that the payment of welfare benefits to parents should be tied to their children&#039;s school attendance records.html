    <div class="print-content"><p>The majority of the world&#39;s states have some form of welfare program meant to ensure the economic and social wellbeing of their citizens who may find themselves in dire economic straits, like unemployment, subsistence farming or landless day labour. The government may give financial benefits to those who see themselves unable to provide for their children and their families. However, there are those who think that such benefits should not be unconditionally awarded, but should involve some responsibilities. Benefits should impose certain obligations on the recipients to better their situation. One such obligation is to send their children to school and monitor their attendance. This measure is meant to break the poverty trap by ensuring the children of the poorest families receive the education and qualifications they need to be able to find a suitable job when they themselves reach adulthood. Such programs, called &#39;conditional cash transfers&#39; have been implemented by governments and international organizations in some developing countries, most notably Brazil, where it is known as Bolsa Familia. Around the world 67 million children are not in school, which only continues cycles of poverty and disease<sup>1</sup>. In order to determine whether such measures are desirable, the proposition needs to show first that there is an acceptable guiding principle behind the policy. Then it would need to demonstrate that the policy would be effective in achieving not only its immediate goal -- getting kids into school -- but its wider, professed aim -- improving their situation in the long run.<sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/2011/07/67-million-children-worldwide-not-in-school/"> Enriquez, Florence (2011), &quot;67 million children worldwide not in school&quot;, United Nations Radio, [Accessed July 21, 2011]. </a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>

                    <p>The main goal of this program is increasing school enrollment overall. If it was too much to expect from families, then the program would have failed in the cases that it was instituted. However, the opposite has been the case. 12.4 million families in Brazil are enrolled in a program called Bolsa Familia where children’s attendance in school is rewarded with $12 a month per child. The number of Brazilians with incomes below $440 a month has decreased by 8% year since 2003, and 1/6 of the poverty reduction in the country is attributed to this program<a href="/print/17698#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Additionally it is much less expensive than other programs, costing only about .5% of the country’s GDP<a href="/print/17698#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Considering that this program has been affordable and successful in both reducing poverty and increasing school enrollment it is worth using as an incentive in more programs around the world.&nbsp;</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17698#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;'How to get children out of jobs and into school', <em>The Economist</em>, 29 July 2010,&nbsp;http://www.economist.com/node/16690887</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17698#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp;'How to get children out of jobs and into school',&nbsp;<em>The Economist</em>​, 29 July 2010, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/16690887" title="http://www.economist.com/node/16690887">http://www.economist.com/node/16690887</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Parents on welfare benefits are the most likely to need the extra inducements. They generally tend to be less educated and oftentimes be less appreciative of the long-term value of education. In the late 90's, 42% of people on welfare had less than a high school education, and another 42% had finished high school, but had not attended college in the US. Therefore they need the additional and more tangible, financial reasons to send their children to school. Children living in poverty in the US are 6.8 times more likely to have experienced child abuse and neglect<sup>1</sup>.<br>While attendance might not be a sufficient condition for academic success, it is certainly a necessary one, and the very first step toward it. Some parents might be tempted to look at the short-term costs and benefits. Sending a child to school might be an opportunity cost for the parents as lost labor inside or outside the homes (especially in the third world) the household, or as an actual cost, as paying for things like supplies, uniforms or transportation can be expensive. Around the world there are an estimated 158 million working children, who often need to work to contribute to their family's livelihood<sup>2</sup>. In the UK it is estimated that sending a child to public school costs up to 1,200 pounds a year. If they lose money by not sending children to school, this would tilt the cost-benefits balance in favor of school attendance.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.childrenshealthwatch.org/upload/resource/Duncan2000.pdf">Duncan, Greg and Brooks-Gunn, Jeanne (2000), "Family Poverty, Welfare Reform, and Child Development", Child Development, [Accessed July 21, 2011]</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href=" http://idebate.org/<a href="http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_childlabour.html" title="http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_childlabour.html">http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_childlabour.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span> "> <a href="http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_childlabour.html" title="http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_childlabour.html">http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_childlabour.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span> [Accessed July 13, 2011].</a></p>        </div>

                    <p>When society has to step in and provide for those who've proved themselves unable to provide for themselves that should reasonably create certain expectations on the part of those being helped. In almost every aspect of life, money is given in return for a product, service or behavior. It is the same with welfare payments; money in exchange for children being put in school. We expect parents to do a good job in their role as parents. Ensuring that their children attend school is a crucial part of parental responsibility. Children on welfare in the US are 2 times more likely to drop out of school, however studies have shown that children who are part of early childhood education are more likely to finish school and remain independent of welfare<sup>1</sup>. Thus, when a parent is a welfare recipient, it is entirely reasonable to make it conditional on sending their kids to school. If tax payers' dollars are being spent on those who cannot provide for themselves, there needs to be a societal return. One of the greatest complaints about welfare is that people work hard for the money that they earn, which is then handed to others with no direct benefit to society. If children of people on welfare are in school it increases the likelihood that they will finish high school, maybe get a scholarship and go to college, and have the necessary tools to contribute to the work force and better society.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.ounceofprevention.org/downloads/publications/Heckman.pdf">Heckman, James (2000), "Invest in the Very Young", Ounce of Prevention and the University of Chicago, [Accessed July 25, 2011].</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span>and <a href="http://www.childrenshealthwatch.org/upload/resource/Duncan2000.pdf">Duncan, Greg and Brooks-Gunn, Jeanne (2000), "Family Poverty, Welfare Reform, and Child Development", Child Development, [Accessed July 21, 2011]</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>In the US, girls who grow up in families receiving welfare handouts are 3 times more likely to receive welfare themselves within three years of having their first child than girls who's families were never on welfare<sup>1</sup>. Children living in poverty were 2 times more likely to have grade repetition and drop out of high school and 3.1 times more likely to have children out of wedlock as teenagers<sup>2</sup>. They are 2.2 times more likely to experience violent crimes. Children of welfare recipients are more likely to end up on welfare themselves.<br>Welfare should be a hand up, not a handout that leads to dependency on the state. It is the latter if we are only leading people to fall into the same trap as their parents. Education is the way to break the vicious cycle. Through education, children will acquire the skills and qualifications they need in order to obtain gainful employment once they reach adulthood, and overcome their condition. In the developing world, primary education has proven to reduce AIDS incidences, improve health, increase productivity and contribute to economic growth<sup>3</sup>.<br>School can empower children, and give them guidance and hope that they may not receive at home. Getting kids in school is the first step to equipping them with the skills to better their situations, and if encouraged by their parents they might consider scholarships to college or vocational school. The program does not guarantee this for all, but it is likely more effective than the leaving parents with no incentive to push their children. Benefits are supposed to promote the welfare of both parents and children. One of the best ways to ensure that welfare payments are actually benefiting children is to make sure they're going to school. This is simply providing parents with an extra incentive to do the right thing for their children and become more vested in their kids' education.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.familyfacts.org/briefs/3/a-closer-look-at-welfare">Family Facts, "A Closer Look at Welfare", [Accessed July 21, 2011]. </a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span><br><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.childrenshealthwatch.org/upload/resource/Duncan2000.pdf">Duncan</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span><a href="http://www.childrenshealthwatch.org/upload/resource/Duncan2000.pdf">, Greg and Brooks-Gunn, Jeanne (2000), "Family Poverty, Welfare Reform, and Child Development", Child Development, [Accessed July 21, 2011]</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span><br><sup>3</sup>http <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/ieg/education/facts_figures.html"> World Bank, "Facts about Primary Education",[Accessed July 21, 2011]. </a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Just because students attend school does not mean that they are going to receive a quality education. The best educated children are those whose parents are involved heavily in their school, helping them with their homework, and pushing them to excel<sup>1</sup>. Without involved parents, students can become just as easily discouraged. There really need to be programs to involve parents more in school, and provide good mentors and role models for students who don't have them. Schools also need to be improved. Just sending kids to school doesn't mean that they are going to learn and be determined to better themselves. Additionally particularly in the third world if children don't have good schools and qualified teachers, then what is the point of going to school?<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jrlsasw16&amp;div=32&amp;id=&amp;page=">Chavkin, Nancy, and Williams, David (1989), "Low-Income Parents' Attitudes toward Parent Involvemet in Education", Social Welfare, [Accessed July 21, 2011]. </a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span></p>        </div>

Cutting benefits will only hurt the children we are trying to help, with their families deprived of the resources to feed them or care for them.

There are already 14 million children in the US that go hungry, and 600 million children worldwide that are living on less than a dollar a day<sup>2</sup>.

                    <p>This policy requires that parents be held accountable and punished for the actions of their children. It suggests that their failure in instilling good values is because they care less than middle-class, educated parents. That is a broad and stereotypical assumption. Such parents, many of whom are single mothers, find it harder to instill good values in their children because they live in corrupt environments, surrounded by negative influences[1]. They should be aided and supported, not punished for an alleged failure. Just encouraging putting children in schools does not recognize the larger problems. Some families cannot control their children, who would rather make money than go to school. And caps on the number of children these programs can apply to, as is the case in Brazil, creates problems as well for the families[2]. People are doing their best, but the environment is difficult. Providing safer and more low income housing could be a solution versus punishing people for what is sometimes out of their control.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2008/10/women_poverty.html">Cawthorne, Alexandra (2008), "The Straight Facts on Women in Poverty", Center for American Progress, [Accessed July 21, 2011]. </a> <span class="print-footnote">[13]</span><br><sup>2</sup></p>        </div>

                    <p>If families have incentives to send their children to school, and raise their children with a value of education, stressing the need for them to go to school they are more likely to finish high school and lift themselves out of these environments. The reason why some children would rather work then go to school is because they have been raised in an atmosphere that does not stress education and the necessity to finish high school. This type of program would push parents to change their children's values as they grow up. Additionally, a child's sense of duty to their family because of welfare payments being connected to their school attendance would give them further reason not to drop out, even if they do not like or value school.</p>        </div>

                    <p>School attendance is not a positive outcome in and of itself. It should be encouraged only if it is conducive to learning and acquiring the meaningful education needed to break out of the poverty trap. Blaming the poverty cycle on kids failing to attend school ignores the fact that schools are failing children. Public schools are often overcrowded, with poor facilities and lacking the resources necessary to teach children with challenging backgrounds. In 2011, 80% of America's schools could be considered failing according to Arne Duncan who is the secretary of education<sup>1</sup>. Schools in developing countries often lack qualified teachers, and can suffer from very high staff absenteeism rates<sup>2</sup>.<br>A more effective school system would result in fewer kids dropping out, not the other way around. Additionally, involved parents are integral to effective education<sup>3</sup>. Simply blackmailing them with money to do the right thing will not work. In fact, you might actually experience backlash from parents and kids, who'll see school as a burdensome requirement that is met just so you can keep the electricity on. Throwing kids into school where they do not have confidence, support, and the necessary facilities is not productive.<br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/education/10education.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=education">Dillon</a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/education/10education.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=education">, Sam (2011), "Most Public Schools May Miss Targets, Education Secretary Says", New York Times, [Accessed July 21, 2011]. </a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/ieg/education/facts_figures.html"> World Bank, "Facts about Primary Education",[Accessed July 21, 2011]. </a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span><br><sup>3</sup><a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jrlsasw16&amp;div=32&amp;id=&amp;page=">Chavkin</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span><a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jrlsasw16&amp;div=32&amp;id=&amp;page=">, Nancy, and Williams, David (1989), "Low-Income Parents' Attitudes toward Parent Involvemet in Education", Social Welfare, [Accessed July 21, 2011]. </a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Welfare should not be used as a tool of social engineering. These are people who cannot provide even basic necessities for their families. Asking them to take on obligations by threatening to take away their food is not requiring them to be responsible, it's extortion. It is not treating them as stakeholders and equal partners in a discussion about benefits and responsibilities, but trying to condition them into doing what the rest of society thinks is good for them and their families. There is a difference between an incentive and coercion. An incentive functions on the premise that the person targeted is able to refuse it. These people have no meaningful choice between 'the incentive' or going hungry. This policy does not respect people's basic dignity. There is no condition attached to healthcare and Medicaid that says people have to eat healthily or stop smoking, so why should welfare be conditional? Allowing them and their children to go without food if they refuse is callous. Making welfare conditional is taking advantage of people's situation and telling them what they need to do to be considered valuable to society; it is inherently wrong. It impedes on people's rights to free choice and demeans them as worthless.</p>        </div>
