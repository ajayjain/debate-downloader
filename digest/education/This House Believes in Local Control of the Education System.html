    <h1 class="print-title">This House Believes in Local Control of the Education System</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>In 2000, the United Nations convened a Millennium Summit to address the world’s main development challenges.&nbsp; The identified goals were adopted by 189 nations and set to be achieved by 2015.&nbsp; Target goal #2 was “to achieve universal primary education.” &nbsp;Since education is a clearly a universal priority as relate to the economic welfare of the world, there is increasing interest in how to meet educational goals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is much variation in educational systems and clear differences in the economic situations across the world, one continuing theme exists: &nbsp;how to best meet the needs of citizens.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Since citizens are a product of educational systems as well as continuing contributors to education, to what degree should they be involved in the education of their children?&nbsp; Some would propose that in democratic societies, citizens always have a voice in students’ education through the political process.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at what juncture should the political process determine citizen involvement and participation?&nbsp; Should the voice of citizens come from a local jurisdiction or through a national entity?&nbsp; Questions develop around who has the most right to these decisions, who has the best insight into these decisions, and who is best able to provide for the educational needs of citizens.&nbsp; The tension between federal or local control has philosophical roots as to the responsibilities of government and continues into the discussion of how to deal specifically with the educational needs of citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp; The controversy lies in whether local control is superior to national control in the education of citizens. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>According to Oxford Dictionaries Online, the term local is defined as “belonging to or relating to a particular area or neighbourhood.”&nbsp; Control refers to “the power to influence or direct people’s behaviour or course of events”.&nbsp;&nbsp; As there is no definition given for the term local control, those terms are combined in common usage and could refer to a municipal government, to a province, regional, or state government.&nbsp; Although not stated as a comparison, the motion implies a comparison to something, probably a federal government or national ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Education is “the process of receiving or giving systematic instruction especially at a school or university.”&nbsp;&nbsp; System is defined as “a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network.”&nbsp; There are many components to an educational system so this term is also broad.&nbsp; Since the term local control could be interpreted in a wide variety of legitimate ways, to better focus the debate, it would be valuable to indicate the expanse of the term “local”.&nbsp; Local control could legitimately mean municipalities or the regional government structure.&nbsp; The ability to influence does not state what type of influence exactly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Influence could refer to all aspects of an educational system or simply influence/control over certain parts of the system.&nbsp; Even though dictionary definitions are useful, the terms set forth by the proposition require careful thought and consideration when defining them for use in a debate.</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>Although the claim has been made that local control is more efficient in managing the educational system, the proposition has not provided sufficient proof for that claim.&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount of local districts varies widely from country to country as well as within a country.&nbsp; A locality does not necessarily assume a small size.&nbsp; Within each locality variations in educational practices or delivery of education may or may not be more efficient.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the decision makers at the local level who could enable more efficiency and it cannot be presumed that local control in and of itself will lead to efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp; When there is national research and pooled knowledge about the efficiency of delivering effective education, it is likely to be superior to the many local groups striving for efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, federal governments often provide support money when local schools are unable to meet financial burdens and strive to equal education for all citizens.&nbsp;</p>        </div>
