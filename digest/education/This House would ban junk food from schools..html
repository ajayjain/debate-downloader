    <h1 class="print-title">This House would ban junk food from schools.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Junk food is defined by Segen’s Medical Dictionary as “A popular term for any food which is low in essential nutrients and high in everything else—in particular calories and sodium. Junk foods are often highly salted—e.g., potato chips/crisps, pretzels—high in refined carbohydrates (empty calories)—e.g., candy, soft drinks—and high in saturated fats—e.g., cake, chocolates”.<a href="/print/17739#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Individual school governing bodies are however likely to come up with their own definitions of what exactly constitutes junk food for their ban.</p><p>Childhood obesity- defined as a body-mass index at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex, was diagnosed among approximately 15 percent of children and adolescents in the United States in the period from 1999 through 2002. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, the prevalence of overweight children doubled between 1976–1980 and 1999–2002. Although the prevalence of overweight among blacks, Mexican Americans, and Native Americans exceeds that of other ethnic groups, obesity has increased among both sexes and among all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.<a href="/print/17739#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>Childhood obesity is associated with a variety of adverse consequences. Type-2 diabetes now accounts for up to 45 percent of all newly diagnosed diabetic disorders in pediatric patients. Conditions associated with excess weight, such as sleep apnea and gallbladder disease, tripled in children and adolescents between 1979–1981 and 1997–1999. Although childhood-onset obesity accounts for only 25 percent of adult obesity, overweight that begins before age eight and persists into adulthood is associated with a mean body-mass index of 41 in adulthood, as compared with a body-mass index of 35 for adult-onset obesity.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Researchers and public health officials are currently at a loss to explain the rapid rise in weight problems among children and adolescents that began in the 1980s. Concerns about the long-term health consequences of being overweight have ignited a debate about school policies that make junk food available to students in school.<a href="/print/17739#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><p>The proponents of the idea that school lunches are inexorably linked to the childhood obesity epidemic rally behind much publicized campaigns, such as the one initiated by the first lady Michelle Obama called “Let’s Move”. Even though this seems to be a popular and intuitively appealing notion, there are two important questions being raised by its opponents: is the notion correct and are the schools, or rather school lunches, really the ones we should be targeting?</p><p>In September 2006, partly influenced by the campaigning activities of celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, some schools in the United Kingdom implemented a new approach to preparing and sourcing pupils’ meals. This policy requires that caterers ensure that high-quality meat, poultry or oily fish is provided with each meal, alongside at least two servings of fruit and vegetables.<a href="/print/17739#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another approach to banning junk food is also the banning of vending machines with junk food. The new dispensers in the UK, through a government funded project, switched from sweets and junk in the vending machines (which is present in 95 per cent of secondary schools) to milk, fruit, water and other healthy products to buy.<a href="/print/17739#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p><p>Such an approach, where the government takes care of the meals and also preventing the offer of junk in schools is a way how to do it also in other countries.&nbsp;</p><div><a href="/print/17739#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> ‘Junk Food’ Segen's Medical Dictionary, 2011, <a href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Junk+Food">http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Junk+Food</a>, accessed 20 September 2011<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17739#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Dietz, W.

                    <p>Under the pressure of increasing media coverage and civil society initiatives, schools are being called upon to “take up arms” against childhood obesity, both by introducing more nutritional and physical education classes, as well as transforming the meals they are offering in their cafeterias.<a href="/print/17739#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Never before has school been so central to a child’s personal and social education. According to a study conducted by the University of Michigan, American children and teenagers spend in school about 32.5 hours per week homework a week – 7.5 hours more, than 20 years ago<a href="/print/17739#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. School curricula now cover topics such as personal finance, sex and relationships and citizenship. A precedent for teaching pupils about living well and living responsibly has already been established. Some schools, under national health programs, have given out free milk and fruit to try and make sure that children get enough calcium and vitamins, in case they are not getting enough at home<a href="/print/17739#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>.</p><p>While we are seeing various nutritional and health food curricula cropping up<a href="/print/17739#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>, revamping the school lunch is proving to be a more challenging task. “Limited resources and budget cuts hamper schools from offering both healthful, good-tasting alternatives and physical education programs,“ says Sanchez-Vaznaugh, a San Francisco State University researcher.<a href="/print/17739#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p><p>With expert groups such as the Obesity Society urging policy makers to take into account the complex nature of the obesity epidemic<a href="/print/17739#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>, especially the interplay of biological and social factors that lead to individuals developing the disease, it has become time for governments to urge schools to put their education into practice and give students an environment that allows them to make the healthy choices they learn about in class.</p><div><a href="/print/17739#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Stolberg, S.

                    <p>Media sensationalism is a poor justification for any state intervention of any kind. What histrionic television documentaries usually provide nothing more than a warning that our kids are in danger, along with a list of all the diseases obesity might cause. But there is absolutely nothing that would explain how exactly something as drastic as a ban would do anything to begin solving this problem.</p><p>These observations highlight a distressing truth about contemporary western society – we are unable to accept that the state is unable to solve problems without the assistance and support of civil society. We have a hard time accepting the fact that responsibility will have to fall on the shoulders of parents to enforce (or, more likely, to adopt in the first place) a healthy and active lifestyle in their families.</p><p>Advice provided by the Mayo Clinic explains that just talking isn’t effective. Kids and parents should go together for a brisk walk, ride on the bike or any other activity. It is important for a healthy lifestyle that parents present exercise as an opportunity to take care for the body, rather than a punishment or chore<a href="/print/17739#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p><p>Finally, there is absolutely nothing stopping schools from offering healthier options alongside existing ones. In fact, many schools are choosing a healthier path already, without being forced by governments or regulatory bodies.</p><div><a href="/print/17739#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>MayoClinic.com, 'Fitness for kids: Getting children off the couch',&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fitness/FL00030">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fitness/FL00030</a>, accessed 09/10/2011</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

A large extent of what schools do is imprinting the ideas the society values. In most western countries those would be the ideas of fairness, democracy, freedom of expression, etc. The other side of the coin is the transference of knowledge, knowledge of mathematics, history, but also of biology, health and nutrition.</p><p align="left">We see thus that the proposed ban on specific choices one makes in school, whether be it choices regarding food or choices regarding the clothes one wears, the ideas one expresses, and so on, is truly meaningless in the existing concept of education.</p><p align="left">What the schools should be doing is putting more emphasis on getting the message of the importance of a healthy lifestyle across. Our kids should be taught that this lifestyle consists of more than just whether or not we chose to eat a hamburger and fries for lunch. In short, this ban falls short of truly educating the children about how important physical activity, balanced meals and indulging in moderation are.</p><p align="left">They should also focus on the importance of choice, since in the case of childhood obesity, making the right nutritional and lifestyle choices is of paramount importance. But they should also focus on the importance of choice for a society and how all should take responsibility for their choices in such a society.</p>        </div>
