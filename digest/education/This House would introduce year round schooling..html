                    <p>During long summer holidays, students completely put aside learning and forget all about their studies for up to three months. In this time, they inevitably forget quite a lot of what they have learned. Teachers then have to spend the first weeks of the new academic year bringing them back up to speed.

                    <p>Students are going to forget information whether they are out of school for three weeks or ten.

Even if students end up learning more during summer months, they are likely to end up no better educated at the end of the year.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Year-round schooling does nothing to help the issue of boredom. Many “problem children” are more bored in school than outside it; others are often absent from school altogether.

                    <p>For many parents, particularly those with more than one child, summer vacations can be a stressful and difficult time. Without the structure provided by school attendance, children become bored easily and parents struggle to cope.</p><p>This is especially true for mothers who may be bringing up children without a father present, or those who wish to continue or resume their careers after the first few years of motherhood; trying to combine a full-time job with the rigours of motherhood is hard but trying to do so during a three month school holiday is almost impossible. Year-round schooling makes such a work-life balance easier for young parents and allows women to return to the workplace on their own terms.<a href="/print/17879#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17879#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Schulte, Brigid, “The Case For Year-Round School”, <em>Washington Post</em>, June 7<sup>th</sup> 2009. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/05/AR2009060501971.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/05/AR2009060501971.html</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

A single mother who struggles with young children will not be any better off having to take care of their children every six weeks instead of six months.</p><p>Year-round schooling is unlikely to be applied in exactly the same way in different schools, and different classes or groups of students may well be on different timetables – thus, parents may find themselves having to take care of children almost year-round rather than having time off, as at present.</p>        </div>
