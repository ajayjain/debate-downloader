    <h1 class="print-title">This House would fund education using a voucher scheme</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>A voucher system is one in which, instead of tax revenues being distributed directly to state-managed schools, parents are issued with vouchers that can be spent on education in any school, whether it is managed by the state or not. Schools therefore compete for pupils and the funds that come with them.</p>
<p>Such a scheme was originally put forward by Milton Friedman in the 1950s and now systems of voucher funding are in place in several American states and European municipalities. The idea was also briefly the basis for a reform of UK nursery funding.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>State education in some areas of the UK is continuing to fail, despite increased investment. This will allow those pupils who are currently locked into sub-standard state education access to the private schools enjoyed by their more privileged peers (because you can spend the vouchers anywhere). Even if private school fees can only be subsidised by the voucher scheme, most private schools are charitable organisations that do not run a profit, and so in the vast majority of circumstances the voucher will make private schools accessible to poorer families.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The best schools will continue to differentiate themselves (there is competition amongst the top schools in an area to attract the brightest pupils), and as the voucher scheme will subsidise those currently paying for private education the market will be able to support higher fees. The result of this is that the voucher scheme will subsidise better facilities for the best schools, whilst poorer children will remain trapped in the schools with lower standards.</p>

                    <p>State schools will, like the private schools, have to offer a high quality service in order that parents do not take their children elsewhere.

The voucher scheme&rsquo;s harsh free market system of incentivisation takes away extra funding and support &ndash; indeed, failing schools without full classrooms will face diminished levels of funding &ndash; and so makes it even harder to run schools in tough areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, children are individuals who respond in very different ways to different styles of teaching. Parents know their children better than central government possibly could, and so are the best placed to decide what sort of school their child should go to. Currently, there is very little state provision for non-mainstream styles of learning, whereas in the private sector there is a big incentive for educational innovation.</p>

<p>Thus, not only might variety lead to some sub-standard schools, but it might trap children in a particular school that fails to match the child&rsquo;s ambitions as it grows up, and ceases simply to reflect its parents&rsquo; desires, because the child lacks qualifications or even just knowledge required by a more appropriate school in the area.</p>

                    <p>Even if a voucher scheme is used, parents still need to have considerable input in order that their children are able to access the best educational opportunities. Thus, those children who are most vulnerable, i.e. those with inadequate home support structures, will find that they are unable to access the best schools as their parents may lack the desire or knowledge to find out which schools are the best in their area.</p>
<p>Further, this problem will be exacerbated by the subsequent dearth of funding at the worst schools.</p>

                    <p>It is currently the case that some children, with unfortunate home circumstances, don&rsquo;t get optimal educational provision as a result of their parents&rsquo; failure.

                    <p>Under the current system, many schools that are &ldquo;failing&rdquo; are struggling as a result of factors such as deprivation in their area, or high levels of children for whom English is not their native tongue.</p>
<p>There will be no incentive for companies to set up schools in such areas: the voucher scheme dictates that each child gets the same amount of funding, and thus in schools where a lot of extra facilities (like extra teachers, specialist language tutors etc.) are needed the potential profit to be made will be lower. On the other hand, children in well-to-do middle class areas will be highly profitable (it is not difficult to make children with a wealth of parental support do well in their exams). Thus rich children will have a range of subsidised schools from which to choose, whilst the poorest in society are still failed.</p>

                    <p>Admittedly, it may take extra measures to help children in the very poorest areas. This is required under the status quo and could still be provided under a voucher scheme (e.g. extra funding for children in deprived areas). However, there are many children in between the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich who are currently excluded from the opportunities afforded by some of the best schools. These children, as you accept, will see an increase in the choice of schools. The fact that this motion does not solve all of the problems in education does not prove that it does not solve any.</p>

                    <p>The state funds education using taxes taken from everyone in society, not just those who have children. Therefore the state has a duty to benefit the whole of society, not just parents and children, when funding education. It is therefore entirely legitimate for the state to use schools to fulfil other societal purposes. A good example of this is the question of teaching citizenship in schools: it does not necessarily help children to pass exams, and so schools do not have a strong incentive to insure that children are taught it. However, it fulfils government goals of helping to ensure that people become functioning members of our democracy.</p>
<p>When schools are privatised it becomes increasingly difficult for the government to ensure that such agendas are followed in schools.</p>
