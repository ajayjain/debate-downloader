    <h1 class="print-title">This House Would Get A Master’s Degree.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The role that undergraduate studies play in employment and education is becoming increasingly difficult to decipher – not only for individual students, but also for business owners and education administrators. The issue for students mostly relates to the cost of the degree and whether that is offset by potentially higher earnings later in life. The picture is mixed and relates in particular to the subject to be studied and the awarding institution. For individuals and governments the picture is also complicated by the idea of grade hyper-inflation. This theory means that as the number of people continuing to post-graduate study increases, it creates an arms race among applicants for jobs; when a Master’s no longer means that applicants stand out from the crowd, an employer seeking new hires will direct his attention toward the grades obtained by a Master’s student. An ever increasing degree of scrutiny can be envisaged.</p><p>Although there is evidence that higher degrees in some fields-IT, business, engineering and physical sciences- do have a beneficial impact on earnings other forms of post graduate study, notably the liberal arts, seem to have little, if any, effect.</p><p>There are, however, more esoteric arguments about the benefits to society of having a well-educated and highly literate society. Equally there are questions for the academic community; Master’s allow people to test out the world of research degrees without committing to a Doctorate; a Master’s can give aspiring academics an insight into professional life in their chosen filed that Bachelor’s degrees cannot emulate.</p><p>It would also be possibly to argue that the research skills that come with higher degrees- much like debating- make people more engaged and active citizens. However, critics argue that many universities use their Master’s programs as cash cows, and that Master’s qualifications in many fields carry little academic benefit. Some critics suggest that for most students pursuing higher study, it is simply an excuse to avoid entering the job market for another year or two. By contrast, it can be argued that in times of economic difficulty, at least, recent graduates may well be spending their time better by engaging in further study than by either taking on low skilled jobs or being economically unproductive altogether.</p><p>There are a number of issues to be considered here and attempting to class all Master’s programs or candidates as the same is clearly risky. &nbsp;As a result proposition and opposition sides in this debate both need to be very clear on the nature of the degree they are discussing. Harvard Medical and another year’s reading literature at a community college are clearly not the same thing. However there are some generalizations that can be made: regardless of the degree sought, there are going to be some costs involved. Meeting these costs is frequently achieved through loans and indebtedness.</p><p>Equally an increasing number of post-graduates has an impact on the various elements of the labor market, with some sectors that traditionally have not even been the preserve of graduates - such as construction-now seeing applications from people with higher degrees. Equally one can make the assumption that a citizen with a higher degree is likely to be better informed than someone without one graduating from comparable institutions.</p><p>It’s also worth noting in passing that, considering the number of debaters who pursue higher study, this debate can become a little personal –no one like to be informed that they’ve wasted two years and 30,000 dollars. However, it also makes it a very important debate in a world where for many a Master’s degree may not be necessary but is widely seen as being ‘next’.</p><div class="field field-type-text field-field-debate-authors">

                    <p>After nearly twenty years spent in the confines of education, the last thing most students need is another stint away from the realities of earning a living, paying tax and getting to work at nine in the morning. In addition to which, very few Master’s degrees are genuinely comprised of original research. Even in the technical fields, where the qualification could be considered most useful, universities are frequently lagging behind other practitioners.</p><p>There comes a time where study for its own sake is not only self-indulgent but may become increasingly detrimental. For those students- the overwhelming majority- whose degree will have nothing whatsoever to do with their eventual job it is difficult to see what benefit is provided by delaying things, especially when that means more debt and more time without a salary cheque.</p>        </div>

                    <p>There is much more to acquiring additional qualifications than simply learning skills and memorising curricula by rote. Unlike undergraduates, postgrads are likely to spend time working with their peers at other institutions, attending conferences and generally building networks that will serve them well in their chosen careers. They also establish a far closer relationship with members of faculty who may remain guiding figures for years to come.</p><p>Those graduating with a Liberal Arts or Social Sciences degree are unlikely to have an obvious career path ahead of them. A Master’s offers the opportunity to specialise in a particular area or field. A degree in Sociology may not mark a graduate out from the crowd in the ways that an additional Master’s in Social Work or the implementation of social policy would.</p>        </div>

                    <p>There is a real downside to making Master’s degrees the gold standard for educational achievement. If one degree is no longer enough for entry level jobs, then students from poor backgrounds will be further disadvantaged by comparison with student who are able to secure parental support and funding for postgraduate study. Students are already judged on the prestige- and therefore cost- of their first degree. To add an additional layer to the existing hierarchy of university education is doubly unfair. Not only does it require additional debt, but also means that the value of the degree a student has already worked hard to acquire is reduced, as it fails to match up to a new standard.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Opposition is once again making a strong argument for reforming the way that education is funded but that has little to do with the merits or otherwise of pursuing an additional degree.</p><p>Most universities determine scholarships for Master’s programmes on the basis of academic merit as they do for Bachelor’s degrees.</p><p>It is entirely possible that this system needs expansion or greater support or stronger regulation – but that can be said of the entire education system from kindergarten to post-doctoral research.</p><p>Indeed, the fact that a Master’s allows one to buy a competitive advantage would seem to be an excellent reason for doing one. It may not be nice, but it is simply the logical conclusion of not dropping out of high school to go and get a job.</p>        </div>
