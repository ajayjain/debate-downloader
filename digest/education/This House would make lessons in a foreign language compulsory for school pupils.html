    <h1 class="print-title">This House would make lessons in a foreign language compulsory for school pupils</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Nearly all secondary school students (from age eleven) in EU countries are obliged to study at least one modern foreign language up to their final year. Many students study two. Some start learning foreign languages at primary level and, by school leaving age, no longer consider the languages they have acquired as “foreign”. Italy, the Republic of Ireland and the UK are the exceptions where learning a foreign language in school is not compulsory. Outside of Europe, less than half American high school students learn foreign languages<a href="/print/17825#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="/print/17825#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> despite 91% of secondary schools offering a foreign language as a part of the curriculum<a href="/print/17825#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. This however does not seem to be affecting the popularity of foreign languages at the tertiary level with enrolments for Arabic growing by 46% between 2006 and 2009.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> By contrast, approximately 200 million students learn English in China, but only 24,000 US pupils make the effort to learn Chinese languages.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p><p>The English speaking world seems to believe it need not learn foreign languages as most foreigners display competence in English. Foreign language learning in British schools ceased to be compulsory in 2004 and in 2010, only 44% of British GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) students (up to 16 years) studied a language.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></p><p>In August 2010, the National Assembly of Wales announced its plan to spend £4 million on Welsh language training<a href="/print/17825#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> and Welsh speaking schools are prevalent in Wales. All students in the Republic of Ireland study both English and Irish, and some Gaelic language schools are still in action in Scotland. However, despite being given a platform to avoid language death, these minority languages in the British Isles are not considered “foreign” and their presence does not encourage nor empower the students in the UK and Ireland to learn yet more languages.</p><p>The question therefore is whether learning foreign languages should remain compulsory for all school students up to the age of 16.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> The Washington Times, ‘Analysis: U.S. must strengthen foreign language education’, 26 December 2008, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/dec/26/us-must-strengthen-foreign-language-education/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/dec/26/us-must-strengthen-foreign-language-education/</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> U.S. Department of Education, ‘Digest of Education Statistics 2010’, <em>National Center for Education Statistics</em>, p.88 <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011015.pdf">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011015.pdf</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Rhodes, Nancy C., and Pufahl, Ingrid, ‘Foreign Language Teaching in U.S. Schools Results of a National Survey’, <em>Center for Applied Linguistics</em>, November 2009, <a href="http://www.cal.org/projects/executive-summary-08-09-10.pdf">http://www.cal.org/projects/executive-summary-08-09-10.pdf</a></p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> Finston, Mona and Aurigemma, Mark, ‘New MLA Survey Report Finds That The Study Of Languages Other Than English Is Growing And Diversifying At US Colleges And Universities’, <em>Modern Language Association</em>, 8 December 2010, <a href="http://www.mla.org/pdf/2009_enrollment_survey_pr.pdf">http://www.mla.org/pdf/2009_enrollment_survey_pr.pdf</a></p></div><div id="ftn5"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> The Washington Times, ‘Analysis: U.S. must strengthen foreign language education’, 26 December 2008, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/dec/26/us-must-strengthen-foreign-language-education/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/dec/26/us-must-strengthen-foreign-language-education/</a></p></div><div id="ftn6"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="">[6]</a> Hargreaves, Gillian, ‘Poor language skills ‘leave Britons out of EU jobs’, <em>BBC News</em>, 9 May 2011, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13314147">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13314147</a></p></div><div id="ftn7"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" title="">[7]</a> Welsh Government, ‘£4 Million for Welsh language training’, 16 August 2010, <a href="http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/educationandskills/2010/100816language/;jsessionid=yL0DTGKJNGyWQWcsx2rVwhKPR1GxlLJbZ3n5R9zTNyJMPg11nTrL!-2045186729?lang=en">http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/educationandskills/2010/100816language/;jsessionid=yL0DTGKJNGyWQWcsx2rVwhKPR1GxlLJbZ3n5R9zTNyJMPg11nTrL!-2045186729?lang=en</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-curator">

                    <p>A high number of students failing to succeed in languages is not a valid reason to make the subject optional. This mentality opens the gate to making English and math options, simply to eradicate the effort of improving pass rates. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reports that in the UK “A quarter of secondary pupils (aged 11 and over) fail to reach their potential in math(s) and a quarter are making insufficient progress in English”.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Still, optional English and math is unthinkable; these are core subjects- languages should also be considered as such.

                    <p>Languages are not the only economically beneficial skills; sciences, law, humanities, creative studies are favourable. However, skills alone are not enough; people with hands-on <em>experience</em> in their field are needed to work a stable economy. It is immoral that a government makes its people take posts using languages that aid the country’s economy and not the individual’s job satisfaction. At the same time in terms of benefits to the economy of their home country those who have studied languages are more likely to work abroad constituting a brain drain.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The call for students to learn a foreign language not only stems from economic needs but also from the need of improved security and diplomacy, in particular a better understanding of cultures and languages in order to better understand threats to the state and improved foreign services are needed.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In many Anglophone countries even in the role of a diplomat there are worrying numbers who do not have the language skills they need, for example in Canada “only 16% of the 180 foreign service officers who were required to have advanced foreign languages skills for their positions, could speak the needed language.”<a href="/print/17825#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> As a 2007 National Academy of sciences report warns us “the pervasive lack of knowledge of foreign languages and cultures threatens the security of the united states as well as its ability to compete in the global marketplace and produce an unformed citizenry”. <a href="/print/17825#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Since the increased security post 9/11 the government accountability office (GAO) have reported that there are a shortage of foreign language expertise within the government and for this reason may undermine national security.</p><p>Much of the population of mainland Europe go to great lengths to learn foreign languages, especially the dominant English. English speakers should reciprocate the efforts made by their foreign counterparts; Nicolas Sarkozy for example is aiming to make France into a bilingual nation.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Across Europe at least 20% of third-level students claim to be proficient in at least two foreign languages. However, in countries where English is a major language, this is not the case; in Ireland, for example the figure is only 5%.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> In the United States the situation is similar only 31% of US elementary schools and 24% of public schools teach foreign languages.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> Expecting foreign countries to communicate through dominant English is a lazy and arrogant attitude to language and should not be permitted.

Madeline Ehrman observes that the root of this problem is that the “student is “out of sync” with the methodology, the teacher.” &nbsp;Therefore, the antidote is more modern learning styles; “there are some quick fixes that can be made when adaptations are needed”.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Languages should not be abandoned when students find them boring rather the curriculum and methods of teaching need to be changed to make the learning more interesting and more relevant.

                    <p>To refuse to learn foreign languages is narrow-minded, ignorant and blinkered. Language is a means not only of asserting identity but, more importantly of “heritage culture maintenance”. To refuse to learn a foreign language is to disallow anyone’s culture apart from one’s own to be upheld. When this happens, “the dominant groups force ethnic groups into particular… niches”.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This is particularly likely to be a problem in multicultural societies or indeed any society that is not homogeneous. By refusing to learn foreign languages, one refuses to recognise that other cultures even exist.</p><p>For this reason learning a foreign language helps to tackle xenophobia. Negative stereotyping is sadly still prevalent in the modern world. “American students in Maine view persons speaking standard French as shorter, less leaderlike (sic), less thoughtful, less intelligent, less honest, less self-confident, less dependable, less generous, less kind, less ambitious, less stable and with less character than English Speakers”.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Such stereotypes lead to prejudices, xenophobia and, in extreme cases, hate crime. Learning foreign languages is a good way to combat such prejudices, because the students learn about the foreign culture for themselves, meet and converse with its people, and have a first-hand introduction to a foreign people. This will leave them more open minded towards other cultures so less likely to be xenophobic towards other cultures whose language they have not learnt. As Reynolds explains, “discounting stereotypes involves denying cultural differences”<a href="/print/17825#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> such as the ability to communicate through the same language.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Reynolds, Allan G., Bilingualism, Multiculturalism and Second Language Learning, Lawrence Newbury Publishers, New Jersey, 1990, p.10</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Gardner, R.C., Lambert, W.E, Attitudes and Motivation in Second-Language Learning, Newbury House Publishers, Massachusetts, 1972, p.99</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Reynolds, Allan G., Bilingualism, Multiculturalism and Second Language Learning, Lawrence Newbury Publishers, New Jersey, 1990, p.5</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Learning its target language is <em>not </em>fundamental to embracing any foreign culture. Many people can be very open to foreign cultures without learning their language(s). Indeed it may be necessary for most to keep the two separate.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> No one can learn every foreign language and many would not have the time to learn more than a few but that should not prevent learning about and enjoying that culture, its music, its art and even in many cases through translation its literature.</p><p>If a student is forced to learn a language against his/her will, then the negative stereotype of the target culture will only be strengthened, fuelled by ill feeling and negative experiences.

If students want to specialise in for example Science and drop foreign languages in order to be able to do this then they should have this option, a choice which is likely to be beneficial for their chosen career. Students’ progress in their most successful subjects should not be hindered by the burden of language learning.

Rather, because they demonstrate real strength in other subjects they do not wish to be constrained in those subjects by ones where they do not excel.</p><p>A standard complaint is quoted by Ehrman; “(learning languages) affects (all study) a lot!

This has to include harder subjects that would not be the first choice of the students.

Expecting students who have great difficulty in learning languages to be able to do so from those who cannot even explain linguistic concepts successfully is far too much to ask. This one reason why in the UK Ofsted (Office for Standards in Education) considers language teaching in secondary schools to be weak.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>There are similar problems with grammar between those who are bilingual and those who are not. People who are bilingual due to their background do not think in grammar. If <em>they</em> do not know why certain grammatical constructions are used when and why, how is an absolute beginner struggling with languages supposed to understand such grammar rules?<a href="/print/17825#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Webb, Lauren, ‘Ofsted reports poor language teaching in UK’, <em>Veritas</em>, <a href="http://www.veritaslanguagesolutions.com/ofsted-reports-poor-language-teaching-in-uk">http://www.veritaslanguagesolutions.com/ofsted-reports-poor-language-teaching-in-uk</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Reynolds, ‘Bilingualism, Multiculturalism and Second Language Learning’, 1990, p.164</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>This is once again down to the way languages are taught. The quality of teaching needs to be high so that those who struggle more are motivated to overcome this divide. This is also the case with grammar, both learner and teacher need to have patience and be willing to engage.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The critical age for learning a language must also be taken into consideration, it is believed by many experts in the field that it is easier for people to learn languages at a very early age, as it greatly improves ones accent and their ability to learn quickly. Thus the gap between those who progress and those who don’t will be greatly reduced if all students had to learn another language starting from an early primary school age.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Gardner, Attitudes and motivation in Second-Language learning, 1972, p.135</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>For those from countries where English is not the first language English is an obvious language to study, it is a language which is useful all over the world, not just in countries where English is the native language because so many people speak it as a second language. There is not the same obvious second language for native English speakers. It is undeniable that English is increasingly a global language; it is the language of technology and global communication. English is likely to be used in a conversation between for example a German Scientist and an Italian Politician.<a href="/print/17825#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It is therefore being realistic for English speakers to believe that any other language they learn will have less utility than their own.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17825#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> English Online Learners, ‘English the Global Language’, British Council, <a href="http://www.englishonline.org.cn/en/learners/english-for-work/business-bites/global-language">http://www.englishonline.org.cn/en/learners/english-for-work/business-bites/global-language#</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>While it is undeniable that at the moment English is the most used international language this is not a reason to be complacent. Just because English is currently dominant does not mean it will remain so. In the 18<sup>th</sup>, 19<sup>th</sup> and into the 20<sup>th</sup> Centuries French was the international language and before that Latin was in Europe. It is as likely that the dominance of the English language will decline as that it will continue to increase. Students should be taught other languages to take advantage of changes that may occur within their lifetimes.</p>        </div>
