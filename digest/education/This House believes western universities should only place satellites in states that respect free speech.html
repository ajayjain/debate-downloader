    <div class="print-content"><h3>A university of less-than-liberal arts?</h3><p>Should Yale University refuse to operate in Singapore where human rights and free expression face significant restrictions? Katie Engelhart weighs the arguments for and against.</p><p><strong>The case</strong></p><p>In March 2011, Yale University&nbsp;<a href="http://news.yale.edu/2011/03/31/nus-and-yale-create-singapore-s-first-liberal-arts-college">unveiled</a>&nbsp;plans for a new college to be built in collaboration with the National University of Singapore (NUS).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/">Yale-NUS College</a>&nbsp;is to be Singapore’s first liberal arts university and will&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/2">focus</a>&nbsp;on teaching the “major works of Western and Asian civilizations in conversation with one another”. The college will be administered by Yale faculty but housed on NUS’s campus and funded by the city-state.</p><p>In recent months, the new venture has attracted criticism. Opponents accuse Yale of compromising its values and progressive ethos by setting up shop in Singapore, where “[the] government&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/19/singapore-yale-curtail-rights-new-campus">has</a>&nbsp;long restricted the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly”.&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/world/asia/27iht-educlede27.html?pagewanted=all">confirms</a> that “Like all university students in Singapore, those at Yale-NUS will not be permitted to take part in political protests or form groups supporting particular parties on campus.”</p><p>Some of the university’s most vociferous critics reside close to home. In April 2012, Yale College faculty <a href="http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2012_05/lv_faculty.html">passed</a>&nbsp;a symbolic resolution expressing “concern” over the state of civil and political rights in Singapore. One Yale professor publicly&nbsp;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Yale-in-Singapore-Lost-in/127277/">accused</a>&nbsp;the university of having “followed the money”. Another&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-sleeper/as-yales-blunder-deepens-_b_1569495.html">published</a>&nbsp;a column in The Huffington Post alleging that Yale will receive a $300 million&nbsp;<a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/case/a-university-of-less-than-liberal-arts/" title="Click to Continue &gt; by DownloadNSave">payout</a>&nbsp;from Singapore for the deal. Yale University denies that it will profit from the venture.</p><p>An editorial in The Yale Daily News, an&nbsp;<a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/case/a-university-of-less-than-liberal-arts/" title="Click to Continue &gt; by DownloadNSave">undergraduate</a>&nbsp;student newspaper, charged: it is “disappointingly clear that freedom is an afterthought to Yale’s venture into Singapore.” Some of these critics call for the entire collaboration to be quashed.</p><p>Supporters, on the other hand,&nbsp;<a href="http://news.yale.edu/2012/08/28/reinventing-liberal-arts-ground">commend</a>&nbsp;the venture for its pedagogical potential as a means of “reinventing the liberal arts from the ground up”. And while Yale officials acknowledge that they must respect the rights-restricted environment of their host country, they insist that—from a human rights perspective—some cross-cultural exchange is better than none. Academic freedom (to&nbsp;<a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/case/a-university-of-less-than-liberal-arts/" title="Click to Continue &gt; by DownloadNSave">research</a>&nbsp;and publish freely) will reportedly be protected.</p><p><a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/case/a-university-of-less-than-liberal-arts/"><strong>Katie Engelhart's opinion</strong></a></p><p>Should a university refuse to operate in a foreign environment that does not guarantee the same basic level of human rights that its own citizens enjoy<em>?</em>&nbsp;This issue extends far beyond Yale. As some commentators have pointed out, a number of western universities operate satellite&nbsp;<a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/case/a-university-of-less-than-liberal-arts/" title="Click to Continue &gt; by DownloadNSave">colleges</a>&nbsp;in countries with less-than-satisfactory human rights records. My alma mater Cornell&nbsp;has a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cornell.edu/visiting/qatar/">campus</a>&nbsp;in <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154471.htm">Qatar</a>, which has largely escaped the kind of scrutiny applied to Yale-NUS. Moreover, the questions posed above can be applied beyond the walls of academia.&nbsp;<a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/2012/02/twitters-new-censorship-policy/">Recall</a>&nbsp;the backlash surrounding Twitter’s plan to censor tweets on a country-by-country basis to conform with varying free speech laws.</p><p>I am sympathetic to opponents’ claims, which are aptly summed up in an&nbsp;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Yale-in-Singapore-Lost-in/127277/">article</a> by Yale professor Christopher L. Miller in&nbsp;<a href="http://chronicle.com/section/Home/5">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a><em>.</em>&nbsp;As Miller rightly points out, this is a&nbsp;<a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/case/a-university-of-less-than-liberal-arts/" title="Click to Continue &gt; by DownloadNSave">question</a>&nbsp;of principle; discussion of whether or not Singapore will go so far as to curtail the rights of Yale-NUS students is secondary. Particularly moving is Miller’s acknowledgement that, as a gay man, his own lifestyle and identity would land him at the pointed end of Singaporean law.</p><p>And yet on balance, I support Yale University’s decision to launch Yale-NUS. Some engagement with Singaporean students and the city-state itself, however limited, is indeed better than none. Educational exchanges have long been conduits for cultural exchange. Isolation has not. And Miller’s lamentation that Yale did not instead open a campus in a city like Paris seems out of touch.</p><p>As Yale University’s president Richard Levin explained: “We undertook this partnership to advance in Asia both the development of liberal arts curriculum and pedagogy encouraging critical inquiry. These in themselves are objectives worthy of a great American institution.”</p><p>-&nbsp;Katie Engelhart</p><p><a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/casestudies/"><strong>Read this debate and others on Free Speech Debate</strong></a></p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>The growth of universities as beacons of free speech has been a fundamental part of their history in the West; notably during the renaissance, reformation and enlightenment. The democratisation of that process with the expansion of the university sector in recent decades is merely the latest stage in an ongoing process.</p>
<p>However, that entire process has been driven (along with the artistic, cultural and scientific changes they have inculcated) on the basis that universities allow for the free exchange of ideas and flourish in environments where that approach is standardised throughout society<a href="/print/44516#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>. Marxist scholars have gone further in calling for a critical pedagogy in which perspectives other than academic orthodoxy are normalised within universities.</p>
<p>Such institutions produce the best graduates because they have the best academics and the best academics will stay where they are free to publish whatever their research is and express their own views. For example in the 1990s 55.7% of those who had immigrated to the USA from the USSR described themselves as academics, scientists, professional or technical workers.<a href="/print/44516#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> Those academics in turn respect the intellectual tradition of dissent and critical scrutiny of which they are the inheritors. To take something else and slap the name &lsquo;Yale&rsquo;&ndash; or for that matter Oxford, Harvard or ETH Zurich &ndash; on it and pretend that nothing has changed devalues the qualification. Without the intellectual dissent and freedom of academic inquiry it is intellectually dishonest to call the degree the same thing.</p>

                    <p>Universities also survived the inquisition, the French revolutionary terror and the tyrannies of twentieth century Europe. The issue being discussed here is not in the same league as any of those. There is, as a result, clearly nothing innate that requires an appreciation of free speech for universities to operate. Furthermore universities do not locate or relocate en masse depending on the direction of the political wind.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>In much the same way that material investment in countries can be used as a bargaining chip to secure improvements in areas of legislation, so cultural investment can be used to secure rights associated with related fields of endeavour. Free speech is merely the most obvious. It is reasonable for a western university to insist that its graduates will need to have access to the fruits of a free press and democratic speculation of experts and the wider public<a href="/print/44516#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>.</p>
<p>The cases of the lecturer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Thye_Poh">Chia Thye Poh</a> who is arguably the world&rsquo;s longest serving prisoner of conscience or the political opposition leader, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Cheng_(Singaporean_dissidents)">Vincent Cheng</a> who was barred from addressing a talk organised the History Society of NUS at the national library<a href="/print/44516#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> both give examples of how Singaporean government actions impact directly on university life and academic freedoms. In the light of this, it seems the height of reasonableness for Western universities to say that they will only operate in areas that offer the same academic freedoms they would expect in their home country. If the Singaporean government wants that benefits that Yale graduates can bring, they should be prepared to accept such a change.</p>

                    <p>A bargaining chip, by definition needs to be part of a bargain. Using it to demand a change in the structure of the state as a whole is hardly reaching a bargain &ndash; it&rsquo;s dictating a fiat. An invitation from a country to a university is a big step in expressing an interest in how that institution works and the values it promotes. Using that as an opening to demonstrate the strength of those ideas is an opportunity that should not be dismissed.</p>

                    <p>Employers and others expect certain degrees to mean certain things; they are more than just an expensive badge. In the case of elite western universities part of what that means is a critical approach to the world and the willingness to challenge ideas, regardless of the authority that holds them. Part of their exclusivity derives from their admission standards, partly from the academic rigour of their scholars and partly from the simple fact that there are only a relatively small number of graduates.</p>
<p>In other areas universities are all too aware of selling their reputation &ndash; impartiality, avoiding plagiarism and so forth &ndash; the same should be true here. If a degree from a western university does not mean that it recognises issues such as creativity and free thinking then it devalues the degree itself.</p>
<p>As a result the very governments that are so keen to acquire the creative, critical skills offered by graduates of western-style education will end up undermining the very thing that they seek. This impacts not only the graduates from Asian campuses of western universities but also their peers at the home institution<a href="/print/44516#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>.</p>

                    <p>Employers measure degrees by the academic results they indicate. The level of political engagement of the individuals is not critical &ndash; or even relevant &ndash; to that measure. In a global market of tens of millions of students graduating every year<a href="/print/44516#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> an increase of a few thousand in those graduating from top universities will do little to dilute their iconic brands while taking advantage of communications technologies to justify their global reputation.

                    <p>There is certainly some evidence to suggest the view that trade with a country can benefit human rights as increased wealth provides many with more choice and better standards of living.<a href="/print/44516#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> Certainly that argument has been made by governments and multi-nationals based in the West. It is not unreasonable to suspect that this may relate to academic cooperation as well, as Richard Levin suggests in the introduction. However it seems likely that in this latter case, as in the former, that a gradualist approach is the sensible one to take. We build on existing strengths while agreeing to differ in certain areas. To extend the trade example, China, the US and the EU all manage to trade with each other despite differing approaches to the death penalty. They trust that through cooperation over time, changes can be achieved. This will happen slowly in some instances &ndash; as with the &lsquo;drip, drip&rsquo; affect in China - or quickly in others as has been the case in Burma<a href="/print/44516#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>.</p>
<p>On key difference to note with the shift towards establishing elite universities around the world rather than shipping the world&rsquo;s elite in to attend them in the UK and the US is that it opens opportunities to a much wider social group. For decades a small handful &ndash; children of the wealthy and political elite - have had the opportunity to have a Western education before returning home as well-educated tyrants and sycophants. Expanding the learning opportunities to the rest of the nation seems both just and reasonable.</p>

                    <p>There is gradualism and then there is inertia. Refusing to cooperate with governments where individuals can be banned from addressing a group of students would seem to be setting the bar relatively low. In this particular instance, the bar doesn&rsquo;t appear to have been set anywhere. The example given by opposition is of one between states, this is between state actors and organisations who rely on the free expression of ideas as part of their raison d&rsquo;etre.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>There are two parties involved in this interaction, the state and the university. To pretend that is an entirely one way process is to ignore reality. Contrary to the belief of many Senior Common Rooms, states do not exist for the convenience of universities. Indeed universities quite happily accept the political and economic stability provided by states at exactly the same time as criticising the methods they need to use to maintain it.</p>
<p>However, ultimately universities are service providers from the point of view of the state, training and skilling the workforce. The university provides its expertise in exchange for funding and student fees. Where, exactly, the opinions of the faculty enter into such an equation is not clear and appears to have been assumed by proposition. Of course individual academics and students have the right to their own political views but the idea that a university as an institution has rights distinct from, say, a supermarket chain is impossible to justify. If a supermarket announced that it should be free to ignore local laws and adopt those of its base state instead, that would clearly be rejected. Just as when a food chain invests in a country for, say, beef, the arrangement is predicated on the understanding that both parties benefit and each has a little room for negotiation.<a href="/print/44516#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> The same should apply here. If prop were to argue that Asian nations should relax there approach to cannabis so that it students could enjoy a more genuine &lsquo;Western student experience&rsquo; the statement would be the subject of ridicule, so should this be.</p>

                    <p>Singapore in this particular instance is securing far more than a &lsquo;service provider&rsquo; from a university whose foundation precedes that of the state by over a century. Yale is an internationally identifiable brand, as would any other major university be, and Singapore and NUS benefit from that association. Yale is in a strong position here to argue for things that stretch well beyond the lecture theatre.</p>

                    <p>Of all possible institutions, for a university to suggest that it is not open to defending its ideas rather than insisting that they be artificially imported seems counter-intuitive. As Asian and European intellectual traditions increasingly interact as a result of economic interaction there are going to be clashes between and attempts to integrate the Confucian and Socratic approaches<a href="/print/44516#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>. Part of that is the relationship between academia and the state. Western institutions seeking to establish themselves as a presence in Asia should at least be open to the idea that a different approach may have something to offer. After all a willingness to accept new ideas and attitudes is key to the ethic of any university &ndash; the assumption that such an exchange would only flow in one direction is astonishingly arrogant.</p>
<p><a href="/print/44516#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://www.economicsnetwork.ac.uk/showcase/chuah_international">This is true at every level, including simple things such as the approach taken by students to their studies. Inevitably, universities have responded to these in different ways in the two traditions.</a></p>
