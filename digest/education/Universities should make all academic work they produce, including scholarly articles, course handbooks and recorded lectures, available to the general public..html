    <h1 class="print-title">Universities should make all academic work they produce, including scholarly articles, course handbooks and recorded lectures, available to the general public.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Universities produce an immense amount of information. For their students academics write lecture notes, create course guides, and put together bibliographies. They may well also record their lectures and any events they take part in. But teaching is not all that academics do. They often have to write a certain number of journal articles per year and university funding is often in large part based upon the amount and quality of the research done by the institution. A large part of their output is therefore is large quantities of research often funded by the state. Importantly academic publishers pay nothing for the journal articles they publish. Yet the final journal articles when they are published individually online often cost more than $30, and considerably more than that for the whole journal or for it in physical form.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Academic books are similarly expensive, sometimes costing over $100.</p><p>High costs for access to academic work used to make sense as unlike publishing for the broad consumer market publishers would only sell a few hundred copies. Small print runs meant that each individual book was expensive to produce. Today however much of the cost can be taken out of the system through publishing online; there is no need for the physical manufacturing of books and journal articles as they can simply be put on the internet. This not only reduces the overall cost but makes the marginal cost of providing access almost nothing. &nbsp;</p><p>While it is perhaps still the norm for access to knowledge to be kept private to universities and journals to be behind paywalls this is now rapidly beginning to change. Open access has been growing rapidly despite opposition from publishers from around 20,000 articles in 2000 to 350,000 today.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Around 30% of peer reviewed journals are already open access and governments are working to increase this number. The Research Councils UK (the main pathway for government funding for research in the UK) will, from April 2013, only fund research if it will be available to the public.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> The European Union is to follow suit and aim “for 60% of European publicly-funded research articles to be available under open access by 2016.”<a href="/print/50503#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Courses are being opened up in the same way, universities found that they could not sell their course materials online, but many decided instead to put some of their online courseware online for free. This includes some of the most prestigious universities such as MIT, Yale, and Berkley.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p><p>In this instance by available to the general public we don’t just mean that they are available when a member of the public goes into the university and asks for the materials but that they are actively made available; such as being published on the internet.</p><p>Asking for all academic work seems to imply that essentially all work that everyone involved in the university undertakes should be available to the general public. However this may be going a bit far; making every essay by every student available would potentially make it difficult to set similar questions in the future by encouraging plagiarism. More questionable would be whether books should be included or excluded. For the proposition there are not many advantages to including books while creating the disadvantage that it would practically eliminate the incentive to publish books on academic issues. Another area that could conceivably be included would be whole online courses that allow for remote learning towards receiving a qualification; the arguments for and against this however while they overlap are different. For this debate I am therefore focusing on academic journals and course materials.</p><div><a href="/print/50503#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Monbiot, George, “Academic publishers make Murdoch look like a socialist”, <em>The Guardian</em>, 29 August 2011, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/50503#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Curry, Stephen, “The inexorable rise of open access scientific publishing”, <em>guardian.co.uk</em>, 22 October 2012, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/occams-corner/2012/oct/22/inexorable-rise-open-access-scientific-publishing">http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/occams-corner/2012/oct/22/inexorable-rise-open-access-scientific-publishing</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/50503#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Suber, Peter, “Ensuring open access for publicly funded research”, <em>BMJ</em>, 8 August 2012, 345:e5184, <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e5184#ref-2">http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e5184#ref-2</a></p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/50503#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> Kroes, Neelie, “Scientific data: open access to research results will boost Europe's innovation capacity”, <em>Europa.eu</em>, 17 July 2012. <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-790_en.htm?locale=en">http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-790_en.htm?locale=en</a></p></div><div id="ftn5"><p><a href="/print/50503#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> Walsh, Taylor, <em>Unlocking the Gates</em>, Princeton University Press, 2011, <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uudfxXEmyG0C">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uudfxXEmyG0C</a> pp.xvii-xix.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-curator">

                    <p>Higher education, as with other levels of education, should be open to all. Universities are universally respected as the highest form of educational institution available and it is a matter of principle that everyone should have access to this higher level of education. Unfortunately not everyone in the world has this access usually because they cannot afford it, but it may also be because they are not academically inclined. This does not however mean that it is right to simply cut them off from higher educational opportunities. Should those who do not attend university not have access to the same resources as those who do?</p>
<p>This can have an even greater impact globally than within an individual country. 90% of the world&rsquo;s population currently have no access to higher education. Providing access to all academic work gives them the opportunities that those in developed countries already have.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>Making these academic materials available to the general public does not mean they are useful to anyone. Many of the materials universities produce are not useful unless the reader has attended the relevant lectures. Rather than simply putting those lectures that are recorded and course handbooks online what is needed to open up education is systematically designed online courses that are available to all. Unfortunately what this provides will be a profusion of often overlapping and contradictory materials with little guidance for how to navigate through them for those who are not involved in the course in question.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The United States University system is famously expensive and as a result it is probably the system in a developed country that has least public funding yet $346.8billion was spent, mostly by the states, on higher education in 2008-9.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In Europe almost 85% of universities funding came from government sources.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Considering the huge amounts of money spent on universities by taxpayers they should be able to demand access to the academic work those institutions produce.</p>
<p>Even in countries where there are tuition fees that make up some of the funding for the university it is right that the public should have access to these materials as the tuition fees are being paid for the personal teaching time provided by the lecturers not for the academics&rsquo; publications. Moreover those who have paid for a university course would benefit by the materials still being available to access after they have finished university</p>

The Human Genome Project would have been an immense success either way but it is doubtful that its economic impact of $796billion would have been realised without open access.</p>
<p>The rest of the economy benefits too. It has been estimated that switching to open access would generate &pound;100million of economic activity in the United Kingdom as a result of reduced research costs for business and shorter development as a result of being able to access a much broader range of research.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>Open access makes little difference to research. If an academic needs to use an article they don&rsquo;t have access to they can pay for it and gain access quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The benefits to the economy may also be overstated; we don&rsquo;t know how much benefit it will create. But we do know it would be badly damaging to the academic publishing industry. We also know there are risks with putting everything out in the open as economies that are currently research leaders will be handing out their advances for free. There is an immense amount of stealing of intellectual property, up to $400 billion a year, so research is obviously considered to be economically worth something.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> With open access the proposal is instead to make everything available for free for others to take as and when they wish.</p>

                    <p>Having paid for access to universities and the materials they provide for research students have a right to expect that they will have all the necessary materials available. Unfortunately this is not always the case. University libraries are unable to afford all the university journals they wish to have access to or need for their courses. Therefore any student who wants to go into areas not anticipated by the course they are enrolled with will find that they do not have access to the materials they require. They then face the cost of getting individual access to an online journal article which can be up to $42, despite there being almost zero marginal cost to the publisher.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This even affects the biggest and best resourced university libraries.

                    <p>Most students most of the time stick to the core areas of their course and thus are not likely to encounter difficulties with finding the relevant information. For those who do require resources that the university library does not have access to they can use interlibrary loan for a small fee to cover the cost of sending the book or article between universities.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The universities in most countries can therefore effectively split the cost of access by specialising in certain subjects which limits the number of journals they need to buy while making the resources available to their students if they really need them.</p>

                    <p>Universities are providing a service just like almost any other business. They provide a service in terms of educating students who are enrolled with them and secondly they conduct research on a wide range of subjects. In both of these cases the university deserves to make a profit out of their work.</p>
<p>When acting as an educator universities are in an educational free market, this is the case even when the cost is provided by the state. All universities are aiming to attract as many students as possible and earn as much as possible from fees. If the university is successful it will be able to charge more as it will attract students from further afield.</p>
<p>While Universities may make a profit on research or even teaching this profit is for the benefit of society as a whole as the profits are usually simply reinvested in the University&rsquo;s education and infrastructure.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>Academic work is not about profit. For most researchers the aim is to satisfy curiosity or to increase the sum of knowledge. Others are motivated by a desire to do good, or possibly for recognition. None of these things require there to be profit for the university.</p>
<p>Moreover we should remember that the profit is not going to the individual who did the research, there is therefore no moral justification that the person has put effort in and so deserves to profit from it. The university does not even take the risk, which is born by the taxpayer who pays the majority of the research budget. Much of the profit from publishing this knowledge does not even go to the university. Instead academic publishers make huge profits through rentier capitalism. They have profit margins of 36% despite not doing the research, or taking any risk that goes into funding the research.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

When providing money for research projects the government often requires cost sharing so the university needs to find other sources of funding.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Third parties however are unlikely to be willing to help provide funding for research if they know that all the results of that research will be made open to anyone and everyone. These businesses are funding specific research to solve a particular problem with the intention of profiting from the result. Even if universities themselves don&rsquo;t want to profit from their research they cannot ignore the private funding as it is rapidly growing, up 250% in the U.S. from 1985-2005, while the government support is shrinking.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>If business wants certain research to use for profit then it is free to do so. However it should entirely fund that research rather than relying on academic institutions to do the research and the government to come up with part of the funding. This would then allow the government to focus its funding on basic research, the kind of research that pushes forward the boundaries of knowledge which may have many applications but is not specifically designed with these in mind. This kind of curiosity driven research can be very important for example research into retroviruses gave the grounding that meant that antiretrovirals to control AIDS were available within a decade of the disease appearing.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>If everything that University provides is open to all then there is less incentive to study at university. Anyone who is studying in order to learn about a subject rather than achieve a particular qualification will no longer need to attend the university in order to fulfil their aim. The actual benefit of university education is less in learning content per se than engaging with new ideas critically, something that is frequently more difficult in an online environment.</p>
<p>Moreover if only some countries or institutions were to implement such open access then it makes more sense for any students who are intending to study internationally to go elsewhere as they will still be able to use the resources made available by that university. Open access if not implemented universally is therefore damaging to universities attempts to attract lucrative international students who often pay high tuition fees.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The vast majority of people who go to University are not doing so simply because they are interested in a subject and want to find out more. Instead they are after the qualification and improved job prospects university provides. Even those few who are in large part studying out of curiosity and interest will likely be doing so at university because they like the student life and want the experience.</p>
<p>However having courses and materials out in the open can even help universities with recruitment. Providing open access boosts a university&rsquo;s reputation abroad which helps it in the international student market. Open access to academic work also helps give potential students a much better idea with what they will be studying which is very useful for students who are unsure where to choose. The benefits are obvious as shown by 35% of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&rsquo;s students choose the university after looking at its OpenCourseWare.<a href="/print/50503#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
