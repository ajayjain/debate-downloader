    <div class="print-content"><p>The United States declared independence in 1776 against what it saw as the overweening power of the British crown regarding taxes, regulations, and representation. Since that time, Americans have resisted anything that smacks of government enforced conformity. The United States at its founding was “secular”, and it did not even have a national anthem until 1931, when the Star Spangled Banner was adopted.</p><p>As a consequence, despite the fact that English is almost uniformly used as the language of culture, government, and commerce, the United States has no codified official language.</p><p>In recent years this has become something of an issue. Much of this change is linked to the spread of the Spanish language as millions of immigrants from Latin America have moved to the United States and an industry of Spanish television stations and services has grown up to cater to them.</p><p>In reaction there has been a push to place on the ballot referendums to declare English the official language in several states. These referendums have generally appeared fairly harmless to most voters, and have tended to pass overwhelmingly, with even liberal Massachusetts passing theirs in a vote which also banned bilingual education with 83% of the vote.</p><p>Proponents have focused on a perceived lack of integration, and the major target of ire has been English as a Second Language (ESL) education in Public Schools. It is argued that by allowing children of immigrants to take classes in their native language the government is actively encouraging immigration.</p><p>These amendments of course do not have to be packaged with bans on bilingual education (though they often have been). Where it is not the focus is on identity, and history, with opponents arguing that English is not threatened.</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

                    <p>From its very founding, English was the common language of the United States, and full participation in the national life was dependent on the ability to speak it.

                    <p>One of the goals of the government in providing education is to prepare students for success in the work place, and therefore the government has an obligation to spend its money in the most efficient way possible to accomplish this.</p><p><a href="http://www.proenglish.org/issues/offeng/index.html">&nbsp;This is relevant because Bilingual education is expensive, requiring the hiring of bilingual teachers, the organization of bilingual classes, and the acquisition of bilingual curriculum materials.</a><a href="/print/17859#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>These costs might be justified if they actually helped students. But the reality is that they do not. For one thing, they allow students to get by without learning English. One of the great obstacles to learning a new language is the fact that parents of students may well speak another language at home. If students suddenly use that language at school as well, they will spend the vast majority of their day speaking a language other than English, with the consequence that they may not pick it up at all, and find themselves at a large disadvantage when they attempt to join the workforce.</p><p>As a consequence, it seems likely that the money could be better used subsidizing tutoring for students learning English than running an entirely separate and parallel educational system.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17859#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Rossell, Christine, ‘Does Bilingual Education Work?

                    <p>In a time when the US has begun to overcome racial segregation, and legal discrimination in other fields, one of the great challenges it faces is self-segregation.</p><p>Linguistic diversity worsens these problems because it inevitably leads to self-segregation. All things being equal, and even if they are not, people like to be around people they can communicate with.</p><p>This was not a huge problem in years past when most immigrant groups were small enough to be easily swallowed, and too small to maintain their linguistic unity, but the Hispanic population in the United States has grown at such a rate, that it is possible to get by with Spanish in many major US cities. Restaurants, businesses and services all exist which cater to it, and there is an entire industry of Spanish language television available.</p><p>This in turn makes the risk of social balkanization much stronger. While a small minority of people may learn new languages because they want to, the vast majority learn them when they have to – and if individuals can get by without doing so, it’s likely that they will not. Rather than assimilation, you will have a divergence between the linguistic minority and the majority.</p>        </div>

                    <p>English-only policies are not about encouraging acceptance of diversity, and to the extent they are about bringing people together it is by forcing immigrants to abandon their culture.</p><p>From the very beginning of the English-only movement during the First World War, when <a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/english-only-laws-are-offensive-to-our-nations-cherished-diversity">anti-German sentiment led to attacks on German-speaking immigrants, the idea of English as a an official language has been brought up to stigmatize immigrants</a>.<a href="/print/17859#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The very debate over the implementation of the policy would do more to stigmatize immigrants than could be made up for by any benefits it could provide.</p><p>It may well be that forcing Immigrants to speak English and work in it would help them to assimilate but so would deporting them across the country where they would be forced to sink or swim. We don’t do that because it would be wrong.</p><p>Secondly, all of the government’s benefits are based on the assumption that individuals can learn English quickly if they are forced to do so.

                    <p>Bilingual education segregates students in its system from those outside it. This limits the opportunities for interaction.</p><p>This is harmful in a number of ways. For one thing, it limits their interaction with peers who will speak English. While it’s possible they may practice English with their friends in a bilingual school, it seems unlikely, as it would be easier to talk in the existing language.</p><p>Furthermore, it also limits the exposure of English-speaking students to immigrants who don’t speak English, allowing negative stereotypes to arise out of ignorance that then can influence governmental policy through the ballot box.</p><p>Finally, this segregation may extend to within bilingual schools themselves, since not everyone seeking bilingual education has the same non-English language. The result might well be that students would group socially into groups based on country of origin, and due to simple demographics this would place the Spanish-speaking students at a significant advantage as there are nearly 30 million of them in the country. This polarization in turn could lead to splits between minority language groups that could reduce their overall social capital.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It may well be that some people backing the push to make English the official language have questionable motives, but the movement should be evaluated based on its results.</p><p>Right now Hispanics are already stigmatized, whether on one hand as temporary labourers unable to speak English and therefore destined for the worst jobs, or as an invading horde planning to conquer the United States.</p><p>For better or worse, the self-segregation of the community reinforces many of these beliefs, while it also prevents their kids from learning English. If this policy helps to break this self-segregation up, and the children of Hispanic Immigrants become as American as the children of German immigrants became in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century then their opportunities will be greatly increased.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Almost no one in the United States knows English, but then chooses not to use it to make some sort of political statement. The language is far too omnipresent in the economy, culture, and everyday life to make such a choice attractive or even sane.</p><p>Nor do people generally choose not to learn English. The advantages and opportunities it opens up, and the stigmas and discrimination facing non-English speakers mean that learning English is one of the first things any immigrant is going to try and do.</p><p>In reality therefore we are going to be talking about people who can’t speak English, either because they have not learned it yet, or because they can’t learn it.
