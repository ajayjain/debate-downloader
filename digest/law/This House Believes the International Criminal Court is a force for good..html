    <h1 class="print-title">This House Believes the International Criminal Court is a force for good.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Especially since the end of World War II, there have been calls for a global system of justice and an effort to prevent massive atrocities from occurring. Tribunals to prosecute crimes committed in Yugoslavia and Rwanda brought up the question of whether a permanent court would be beneficial. The International Criminal Court (ICC) was born out of these efforts to recognize an international court on July 1, 2002 with the founding of the Rome Statute to prosecute crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes. The Rome Statute states that the court also has jurisdiction over crimes of aggression, but lacks a definition of what constitutes those crimes and thus will only have the ability to prosecute them when there is an amendment passed. The ICC differs from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in that the ICJ tries legal disputes between countries; the ICC is specific to individuals. The ICC is a permanent court that will try individuals if either a) the Security Council refers a case to the court, or b) if the state on whose territory the crime was committed/the state of the accused&#39;s nationality has ratified the Rome Statute. Thus, the ICC relies on the cooperation of member states to find and apprehend criminals. The Security Council&#39;s role in the court was a contentious issue during the conference held to draft the Rome Statute and remains one of the issues with the court today; currently, the Security Council can either refer cases or delay them for 12 months an unlimited number of times. The ICC prosecutor may investigate cases based upon information from reliable sources other than the Security Council such as non-governmental organizations, victims, etc.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Currently, 115 countries have ratified the Rome Statute and another 34 have signed but not ratified the treaty. Proponents argue that the ICC is a necessary step to fight heinous crimes and institute justice while deterring crime in an increasingly globalized world. Other nations who oppose the ICC, such as the United States, China, and Russia cite issues of sovereignty and abuse. Possible alternatives to the ICC include individual tribunals and reconciliation programs. This debate questions whether the ICC should be accepted by nations and consequently whether states should ratify the Rome Statute.</p>

                    <p>The ICC is uniquely beneficial because of its intention to be a permanent force that will always hold people accountable, instead of slowly reacting to crimes after-the-fact. It is intended to be universal and apply to every situation without mandating the creation of a new tribunal every time something happens, and may be even more effective than tribunals at responding to crimes. Even though tribunals such as the ones for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda may have worked, they were "necessarily limited in scope" and cannot be applied on a large scale, which is what is needed.<sup>1</sup> Additionally, those tribunals were relatively ineffective, as they took two years to set up, and relying on establishing new tribunals every single time wastes precious time. Doing so would also let smaller but still serious crimes slip under the radar, as they would not warrant the creation of a new tribunal, but may still count as a crime against humanity.<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup> Kirsch, Philippe.

                    <p>Individual tribunals are actually better at addressing the specific situation.</p><p>The idea of "universal jurisdiction" becomes dangerous when it is regarded as a blanket solution. For example, after the Spanish Civil War, post-Franco Spain decided to avoid trials for the sake of national reconciliation that enabled it to become a peaceful democracy. Setting a precedent of universal jurisdiction for punishment unnecessarily precludes better reactions more tailored to the specific scenario.<sup>1</sup> (See opposition argument #3 for elaboration).</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57056/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.

                    <p>A large issue with the ICC is that it subjects member states to definitions that can be interpreted in a number of ways. For example, University of Chicago law professor Jack Goldsmith explains that the ICC has jurisdiction over “a military strike that causes incidental civilian injury (or damage to civilian objects) ‘clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated.’ Such proportionality judgments are almost always contested.”<a href="/print/17576#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p><em>First</em>, nations have a first and foremost obligation to protect their own citizens, but states’ ability to fulfill this duty would be hindered by the threat of ICC prosecution. Certain nations face asymmetrical warfare – for example, the US routinely fights combatants who use innocent human shields, soldiers disguised as civilians, hostage-takers, etc. When put in context, the US has had to take certain actions that would constitute war crimes in order to fulfill its overarching obligation to its own people; strict compliance with the ICC’s standards would deny countries’ abilities to protect their own people.<a href="/print/17576#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a></p><p><em>Second</em>, the fear of prosecution by the ICC would discourage humanitarian missions, decreasing the protection of rights globally. A study noted that the United States, a nation that sends hundreds of thousands of troops on peacekeeping missions, could have been held responsible for war crimes or crimes of aggression for its interventions in places like Bosnia and Sudan.<a href="/print/17576#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a></p><p><a href="/print/17576#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> Goldsmith, Jack. “The Self-Defeating International Criminal Court.” <u>The University of Chicago Law Review, Vol. 70 No. 1</u>, Winter 2003, 89-104.</p><div><div id="edn2"><p><a href="/print/17576#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[ii]</a> Schmitt, Michael. “Asymmetrical Warfare and International Humanitarian Law.” <u>The Air Force Law Review</u>, 2008.</p></div><div id="edn3"><p><a href="/print/17576#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title="">[iii]</a> Redman, Lauren Fielder. “United States Implementation of the International Criminal Court: Toward the Federalism of Free Nations.” <u>Journal of Transnational Law and Policy</u>, Fall 2007.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>To date, the ICC has empirically only issued warrants against leaders that nations have almost universally agreed upon committed heinous crimes. The existence of the ICC would only deter actions that are so atrocious, they would be comparable to the ones committed by those the ICC is currently pursuing. Countries that refuse to prosecute its own individuals should submit to the court to ensure that there is a baseline standard for rights protection, even in times of war. Otherwise, these crimes go unexposed and unpunished – for example, there has been very little discussion about certain US actions because certain presidential administrations have been adamant about prioritizing national interest over global standards of rights. US attacks on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, US invasion of Panama in 1989, US choice of targets in Afghanistan in 2001, and other actions have been left unexamined because of the lack of a third party with the consent to regulate international action; the ICC could solve this.<a href="/print/17576#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p><a href="/print/17576#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> Forsythe, David P. “U.S. Action Empirically Goes Domestically Unchecked.” <u>The United States and International Criminal Justice, Vol. 24 No. 4</u>, November 2002, 985.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The issues the ICC deals with are inherently subjective, as there is clear disagreement about what counts as a war crime or what the exact definition of genocide is. This leaves dangerous room for the prosecutor to simply decide what he thinks counts as a crime under the statute. Under the Rome Statute, the prosecutor has the power to both initiate an investigation based on reasonable evidence (of which there are no clear standards for outlined in the Rome Statute) and refuse to follow up on an investigation in the name of "justice." There are no clear higher checks on the prosecutor, putting too much power in the hands of one single individual. Additionally, there is very limited judicial review, as the pre-trial chamber is composed of 1 or 3 judges, and the prosecutor is able to find a judge who is sympathetic to his views.<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup> Rubin, Alfred P.

                    <p>There are numerous checks that limit the power of the prosecutor and regulate the ICC's operations.</p><p>There are numerous checks outlined in the Rome Statute that limit the power of the prosecutor, eliminating any concerns of abuse. For example, Article 7 clearly defines what a crime against humanity is, and other types of crimes are extensively defined in the statute. Second, the ICC is allowed to step in only if the national government fails to prosecute criminals, meaning that it will never have to step in and exercise its power as long as countries are doing their jobs domestically, checking its jurisdiction. Third, there are multiple chambers that check each other; for example, the pre-trial chamber makes sure that the prosecutor has enough evidence before proceeding. Fourth, there are 18 judges from differing impartial backgrounds, ultimately making the ICC objective. Other checks can be found upon closer examination of the Rome Statute.<sup>1</sup> Moreover, empirically, the prosecutor has not excessively punished any leader, so claims of abuse have yet to show true in the real world. Trials have been dismissed on the grounds of not having sufficient evidence, etc., so the ICC does not have unlimited power.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm"> United Nations.

                    <p>The court has no obvious enforcement mechanism, as it ultimately relies on states to take action in finding and turning over criminals. Although it can issue search warrants and declare that governments are not doing enough to prosecute criminals, that does not translate into real-world change that gets closer to punishing criminals. There is no reason for nations to submit to a court with no enforcement mechanism while simultaneously exposing themselves to a variety of risks as outlined in other arguments.<sup>1</sup> For example, Chad is a party of the ICC but welcomed Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in July 2010. Although Chad was technically obligated to arrest him, there was no arrest made and Chad's president Idriss Deby welcomed Bashir with open arms, clearly demonstrating the ICC's lack of enforcement powers.<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup> Nanda, Ved P.

                    <p>The ICC has jurisdiction to defy unwilling governments and is still a step towards global enforcement of rights, even if it does not completely solve the problem.</p><p>The ICC can have jurisdiction over criminals whose states refuse to prosecute them (provided certain conditions are met), meaning that they can issue warrants for those who come from or lead countries that will not comply with the ICC. Moreover, the ICC centralizes prosecution efforts under one court, making possible prosecution much more efficient and likely and increasing whatever original chance there was of prosecuting the leader.</p><p>Even if the ICC does have trouble fully enforcing its decisions, it is still a step towards the idea of "collective enforcement," which entails states agreeing upon and following international norms by incorporating them into domestic law and promoting their enforcement.

                    <p>The ICC demonstrates that there is an existing legal court that will hold individuals accountable should they decide to commit grave crimes. The mere existence of the court and the possibility of prosecution (even if not 100%) is beneficial in terms of deterring future atrocities. No leader wants to lose power, and an ICC warrant limits the movement and liberties of leaders. This is empirically true&nbsp;– in Uganda, high-ranking officials of the Lord’s Resistance Army specifically cited potential prosecution by the ICC as a reason they put down their arms. LRA officials like Joseph Kony have to spend valuable time on evading the ICC that would otherwise be used to perpetuate crimes, showing that there are still marginal benefits even if leaders themselves are not always apprehended.<a href="/print/17576#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p><a href="/print/17576#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> Scheffer, David and John Hutson. “Strategy for U.S. Engagement with the International Criminal Court.” <u>Century Foundation</u>, 2008. <a href="http://tcf.org/events/pdfs/ev244/Scheffer.pdf" title="http://tcf.org/events/pdfs/ev244/Scheffer.pdf">http://tcf.org/events/pdfs/ev244/Scheffer.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span>.

                    <p>Deterrence only works if the court actually prosecutes people; however, its crippling inefficiency renders its deterrent effect nonexistent.</p><p>To date, the ICC has yet to actually punish anyone. The lack of hard power and enforcement mechanisms makes it impossible for the ICC to be effective. Tribunals like the ICTY were effective because of US support, military backing, and financial power; the ICC lacks this type of sway and is destined to fail. (See more in the opposition point #2).

                    <p>Pursuance by the ICC doesn't actually result in punishment of the leader; empirically, it has actually strengthened criminals' power after criticizing them.</p><p>Nations, such as African nations like Chad, have painted the actions of the ICC as signs of Western imperialism and domination. Sudan's Bashir, accused of genocide and other crimes against humanity, used the ICC's arrest warrant against him as a sign of heroism and created a rally-around-the-flag effect, further strengthening his regime. Moreover, the ICC's work encourages leaders to cling to their power rather than give it and face prosecution, making punishment even more difficult.

                    <p>In today's world, crimes are no longer confined to single nations and affect the world due to the effects of globalization. An international court is necessary as a global solution to problems that often involve multiple actors; a permanent international court accounts for all parties involved.<sup>1</sup> For example the Lord's Resistance Army has been mostly active in Uganda but has often hidden from the Ugandan military by crossing into Southern Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Because it is not limited to a specific territory, the ICC has truly global jurisdiction and therefore is most appropriate given the recent rise of international crimes. Joining the ICC would also encourage nations to recognize that crimes are no longer confined to specific borders and that the notion of territoriality provides a dangerously limited view of the scope of crimes today; ratifying the Rome Statute would force nations to recognize that domestic and international law inevitably interact.<sup>2</sup> The domestic-foreign distinction has allowed states to ignore or commit certain atrocities in the name of national interest.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/icc/ferencz4.html"> Ferencz, Benjamin B.
