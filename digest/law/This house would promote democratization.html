    <div class="print-content"><p>The role that the developed world should play on the international stage has been a constant battle throughout its history between those that favour isolationism and those that favour a more engaged overseas policy. From the early nineteenth-century European powers set out an Imperialist project to &#39;humanise&#39; the &#39;less advanced&#39; peripheral countries of Africa, Asia and South America<sup>1</sup>. By way of contrast, &#39;Splendid Isolation&#39; was the policy adopted by imperial Britain in the late nineteenth-century under the government of Disraeli and the Marquis of Salisbury whereby they did not intervene in the affairs of other countries unless it absolutely involved Great Britain; this inevitably meant a withdrawal from the practice of promoting the &#39;humanising&#39; political system, at least in Europe<sup>2</sup>. These two policies embody the different attitudes to foreign policy among world powers.</p>
<p>In the new millennium however, what democracy promotion means and implies is a very important issue with many far reaching consequences. Traditionally developed countries have supported democracy promotion through aid programs and development assistance. As key stakeholders in multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, IMF and World Trade Organization, developed countries are in a strong position (some say too strong a position) to attach democratic conditions to aid and trade deals, should it so wish. Propaganda and other such soft, persuasive methods are more popular as they are seen as being less intrusive. However, with the recent wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya the use of military force to promote democracy has entered into the debate as well.</p>
<p>The question is, should countries be pressured to conform to what is simply the current predominant mode of government in the Western world? Or is democracy an inherently superior system that we should strive to see implemented across the globe?</p>

                    <p>Democracy in developing countries is often not fully implemented or is manipulated for the benefit of those in power. Those opposed to democracy promotion often point out that "democracy" is sometimes used a ruse for power politics, and simply coats an authoritarian regime in a more acceptable guise. In countries with major tribal or sectarian divides democracy may involve the majority group oppressing the minority, as is being seen at the moment in 'democratic' Turkey<sup>1</sup>. And after ten years of democratic promotion and reform in Africa, it is still almost unheard of for incumbent regimes to lose power through the ballot box. Instead "managed democracies" ensure that the power of the state (e.g, to appoint election officials, draw electoral boundaries, and manipulate the media) is employed to achieve a favourable result. Nigeria, a former British colony, is a prime example of a country with links to democratic countries refusing to embrace it fully<sup>2</sup>. Settled democracies turn a blind eye to the reality as long as we get the credit for 'promoting' and 'supporting' the ideology. Promoting the façade of democracy is more useless as leaving a country to advance politically of its own accord.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/kurds1.html">Understanding</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span><a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/kurds1.html"> the Turkey-Kurd Conflict’ by Elissa Haney, <em>Info Please, </em>2<sup>nd</sup> March 1999</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3573249.stm">‘Corruption clouds Nigeria elections’ by Sola Odunfa, <em>BBC, </em>27<sup>th</sup> March 2004</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>While the issue of long-term support for emerging democracies is a different debate, it is to some extent irrelevant here. Any step towards democracy is a step in the right direction. When South Africa held its first democratic election in 1994<sup>1</sup> it was less than ideal, with claims over ballot fixing rife, but over time as the country adjusted to the demands of democracy the politics have improved. The country is now safeguarded by one of the world's most progressive constitutions<sup>2</sup>. Half-way states are a necessary stage en route to full democracy. To refuse to promote democracy because it cannot be wholly achieved immediately is short-sighted; with time and a realistic level of support, every country will eventually reach the desired goal.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_general_election,_1994">'South African general election 1994', Wikipedia </a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.southafrica.info/about/democracy/">South Africa Info</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>The primary justification for democracy promotion is the democratic peace theory. The theory of the democratic peace goes back to Immanuel Kant's essay 'Perpetual Peace', which he published in 1795<sup>1</sup>; perpetual peace refers to a state of affairs where peace is permanently established over a certain area, as the Roman and British Empires attempted to do during their respective periods of dominance in history. Kant's theory was that the majority of people would never go to war, unless in self-defence<sup>2</sup>. Democracies tend not to go to war as often as other countries because their military is more directly under civilian control. Authoritarian governments or those heavily underpinned by their respective armies, by contrast, have no such barriers to whimsical invasions of other countries (nor the use of the national army to suppress their own people in a bid to solidify power). Communist North Korea is just one example of a country whose foreign policy is extremely aggressive as a direct result of its political inclinations<sup>3</sup>. Therefore if all countries were democracies there would be no wars as there would be no aggressors. Given the peaceful nature of democratic states, it is clearly in the interest of the USA to promote democratic change worldwide.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm"> 'Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch' by Immanuel Kant</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.random-world.net/world2.html">'World Peace'</a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span></p><p><sup>3</sup> <a href="http://www.cfr.org/defensehomeland-security/north-koreas-escalating-aggression/p23492"> 'North Korea's Escalating Aggression' by Deborah Jerome, Council on Foreign Relations, 23rd November 2010</a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>The imposition of a foreign or alien political theory is often viewed in the recipient country as an unwarranted invasion, whether enforced militarily or not. The globalisation of Western culture is viewed by many as eroding traditional values and this often fosters resentment and can lead to widespread support of terrorism<sup>1</sup>. This does not have the effect of worldwide peace, and again a more indirect Western foreign policy may prevent strikes of retribution by disaffected traditionalists.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.israelnewsagency.com/al-quaedaterrorismus10012.html"> 'How Al Qaeda Justifies Terrorism and Genocide' by Joel Leyden, Israel News Agency</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Democracy is a universal value which knows no cultural boundaries. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status"<sup>1</sup>. It is a fallacy to suggest that we should excuse countries from this clause because their culture seems to preach otherwise. The principles of democracy are something that everyone is entitled to simply because they are right and fair. Democracy should not be reserved as a privilege for those who happen to be born in a culture that already supports it; we must endeavour to make all countries believe in the veracity of this declaration.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a1">Universal</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span><a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a1"> Declaration of Human Rights Article 2</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Some theorists suggest that democracy is a unique method of governance which reflects uniquely western and European values. Afghanistan is a prime example of this<sup>1</sup>. The international community footed the bill for the 2009 presidential elections, worth hundreds of millions of dollars; however, according to the Afghanistan Independent Election Commission (IEC), only about one-third of registered voters visited the polls, approximately 5 million of the roughly 15 million Afghans who registered<sup>2</sup>. A 2010 national survey conducted by the Asia Foundation shows that when faced with social or economic problems, or in need of dispute resolution or services, the vast majority of Afghan respondents approach a non-government entity, either the village shura or jirga, or the malik or mullah<sup>3</sup>. Culturally a more unitary system of governance suits the needs of the country better; to force Western democratic values on other countries through expansive democracy promotion is ultimately to interfere with their right to self-determination and self-government.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/06/27/a_grassroots_democracy_for_afghanistan">'A grassroots democracy for Afghanistan' by Hamdullah Mohib, Foreign Policy, 27th June 2011 </a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.iec.org.af/results_10/pdf/turnout_summary_4all.pdf"> 'Afghanistan Wlosi Jerga Turnout Summary' </a> <span class="print-footnote">[13]</span></p><p><sup>3</sup> <a href="http://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/Afghanistanin2010survey.pdf"> 'Afghanistan in 2010: A Survey of the People' by Ruth Rene, The Asia Foundation, 2010</a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Democracy is good for the worldwide economy, as its values of openness and accountability promote the rule of law and good governance in the people's interest. The threat that the electorate will not re-elect them at the next election forces governments to adopt social and economic policies which will make their citizens richer and more secure. In practice this means creating open markets friendly to inward investment and eager for trade, while reining in corruption, military spending and aggressive foreign policies. China is a good example here. Of course it is by no means democratic, but in order to continue its economic boom it has over the last ten years had to open up its business practices to the world. Integration into the world economy (for example, joining the WTO) has led to greater transparency<sup>1</sup>. Because encouraging such policies is clearly in the economic interests of all current democracies, they should actively seek to promote democracy abroad as the best way to achieve wealth.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article117">'China: The Transition to Capitalism' by G Buster, International Viewpoint, December 2003 </a> <span class="print-footnote">[15]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>The economic benefits of democracy are dubious, despite the attractiveness of the theoretical links between free elections and prosperity. Many would argue that the causation runs the other way, arguing that as an economy develops the rising middle-classes seek to protect their property and business investments by pushing for accountable government which will abide by the rule of law: thus democracy does not need to be promoted politically, it should emerge naturally from economic growth. <strong>See china again – politics coming from economics, not the other way round. </strong>While integration into the global trading community might make countries less inclined to violence for fear of the economic damage they might do to themselves, there are plenty of examples of relatively prosperous countries using their wealth to fund military expansion and often war. Britain and Germany in the years before 1914 spring to mind here, as does Iraq in 1990. None of this suggests that democracies would be wise to prioritise democratization in its foreign policy.</p>        </div>

                    <p>"Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person"<sup>1</sup>, "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression"<sup>2</sup> and "Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives"<sup>3</sup> are three of the most fundamental tenets of democratic society. The vote ensures that public expression can take place peacefully, instead of violently. Free speech provides a legitimate avenue through which to address the government and ease tensions in society that could potentially turn violent. For these reasons, democracies tend not to suppress their people using violence, as in the case of the Tiananmen Square incident in Communist China<sup>4</sup> or with the "Tulip Revolution" in authoritarian Kyrgystan<sup>5</sup>. In fact, democracies tend to have constitutions, which ensure the government cannot violently suppress peaceful dissent, and must always honour the beliefs of the majority of its people. Everyone should have a right to live without fear of suppression and with the ability to voice their opinions and beliefs. Because such values are written deep within the heart of the democracies, our governments should seek to export them wherever possible abroad. If Western democracies are to live up to their calling as "shining beacons" for all mankind, it should seek to promote democratization as the best means of improving human well-being around the world.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a1">Universal Declaration of Human Rights </a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a1">Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 19</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span></p><p><sup>3</sup><a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a1">Universal</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span><a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a1"> Declaration of Human Rights Article 21</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span></p><p><sup>4</sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989"> 'Tiananmen Square protests of 1989', Wikipedia</a> <span class="print-footnote">[16]</span></p><p><sup>5</sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_Revolution"> 'Tulip Revolution', Wikipedia</a> <span class="print-footnote">[17]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Those who are against democracy promotion frame the discussion differently. While democracy does bring liberalization, this can provide a platform for extremist political or religious views which were suppressed under more authoritarian regimes. Also, imposing a democracy risks allowing leaders whose political campaigns are subsidised or supported by terrorists into power, as appears to have happened with Hamas in the Palestinian territories<sup>1</sup>. Consequently it is sometimes in the national interests of democracies to support regimes who share a commitment to the war against terror (e.g. Pakistan or Ethiopia), even if these are less than fully democratic, rather than running the risk of 'liberating' a country which may well turn on them.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/1654510.stm"> 'Who are Hamas?', BBC</a> <span class="print-footnote">[18]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Those that reject democracy promotion often do so in the same breath as rejecting Western imperialism. William Robinson "United States foreign policy [in Venezuela] has absolutely nothing to do with promoting democracy; what it is doing is inherently imperialist"<sup>1</sup>. In the US Robinson outlines that there is "a massive foreign-policy operation to undermine the Venezuelan revolution, to overthrow the government of Hugo Chávez, and to reinstall the Venezuelan elite to power” which is clearly not motivated by genuine concern for the people, given that Chavez’s approval rating in Venezuela is 71%.<sup>2</sup> The US has a history of self-interested intervention in South America over the last century. Governments using military force to change other governments is in itself violent and risks devaluing the democracy it seeks to achieve by making it look like an alien imposition and a form of neo-imperialism.</p><div><p><a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-protest/venezuala_2730.jsp"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="print-footnote">[19]</span> <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-protest/venezuala_2730.jsp">‘The United States, Venezuela and ‘democracy promotion’ by Jonah Gindin, <em>Open Democracy, </em>3<sup>rd</sup> August 2005</a> <span class="print-footnote">[19]</span></p></div><p><sup>2</sup>Ibid</p>        </div>

                    <p>Democracy promotion risks Western military and diplomatic forces being embroiled in conflicts all over the globe, at immeasurable cost. This is not just measured economically: 4447 US service personnel have lost their lives in Iraq and 1680 have died in Afghanistan<sup>1</sup>. The number of civilian deaths in Iraq also stands at 111, 380<sup>2</sup>. However, the economic cost must be taken into account as Western democracies do not have unlimited budgets; estimations suggest that current US intervention in Libya costs a staggering $4mn a day<sup>3</sup>. This is particularly controversial in the context of a global economic crisis where hundreds of thousands are losing their jobs. In essence, democracy promotion risks multiple Vietnam-like quagmires on a global scale. Doing the messy work of nation building once one has disposed of authoritarian leaders can severely deplete national resources. 50, 000 of the 65,000 US troops in Iraq will remain in the country until at least the end of 2011<sup>4</sup>, despite the fact that Saddam Hussein was captured in 2003<sup>5</sup>. The motives may be honourable, but this level of intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries is unsustainable.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://antiwar.com/casualties/">'The Human Cost of Occupation' by Margaret Griffiths, Anti-war.com </a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/"> 'Iraq Body Count'</a> <span class="print-footnote">[21]</span></p><p><sup>3</sup> <a href="http://economicsnewspaper.com/world-economics/u-s-war-in-libya-has-cost-4-million-per-day-9798.html"> 'Us: War in Libya Has Cost $4 million per day', Economics Newspaper</a> <span class="print-footnote">[22]</span></p><p><sup>4</sup> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10839342"> 'Obama confirms plan for US troop withdrawal from Iraq', BBC, 3rd August 2010</a> <span class="print-footnote">[23]</span></p><p><sup>5</sup> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/14/newsid_3985000/3985287.stm"> 'On This Day: 2003, Saddam Hussein Captured', BBC, 14th December 2003</a> <span class="print-footnote">[24]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Democratisation is a gradual and continuous process, which needs to take into account a country's socio-economic and cultural context. We cannot put a price on human rights and freedom. Corrupt governments may be unwilling to embrace democracy, but we have a duty to the people of those countries to offer them the chance to form their own governments. We cannot endow ourselves with the power to withhold human rights from these people. They are integral to effective work on poverty alleviation and conflict prevention and resolution, in addition to being valuable bulwarks against terrorism. Each country and society should be free to choose and develop its own model of democracy, in a locally driven process, but those models must be consistent with universal human rights principles and we must be prepared to support this no matter what.</p>        </div>
