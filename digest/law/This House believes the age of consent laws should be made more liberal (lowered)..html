    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes the age of consent laws should be made more liberal (lowered).</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The age of consent refers to the age at which a person’s assent to have sex is recognised as valid in the eyes of the law. Men (and sometimes women, depending upon local law) who engage in sexual activity with young men or women below this age are therefore guilty of a criminal offence. This is true even if it was the young person who wanted to have sex and agreed to it in total understanding of what they were doing – the agreement of the person below the age of consent is simply invalid in the eyes of the law. Yet in many countries this offence (often called ‘statutory rape’, as in the USA) is one that is very severely punished, sometimes with a sentence of up to life imprisonment.<a href="/print/17895#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Ages of consent also vary greatly depending on sexuality, in most countries people have to be older to consent to homosexual sex than to heterosexual sex. It is the combination of these factors that make age of consent laws highly controversial.</p><p>Age of consent laws are highly complex because of their many variations, and therefore all too often create difficulty for students in age of consent debates. To avoid confusion it is best to:</p><p>(A) Firstly think about the ‘basic’ age of consent rule: For heterosexuals -no sex with anyone below 16 in England, 16 in most parts of Australia, 14 in Canada, 14 in Italy and varying from state to state between 14 and 18 in the U.S.A.<a href="/print/17895#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>(B) Secondly think about the ‘plus’ element – many places in addition to the ‘basic’ rule, also make it an offence for you to have sex with persons below a certain age (usually 18 or 21) if that person is in a relationship of ‘trust or dependency’ with you. This would include relationships between children in foster care and those responsible for their welfare, and those between teacher and student. Such places include England, Australia and Canada.<a href="/print/17895#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><p>(C) Thirdly think about the ‘minus’ element – in subtraction from the above two rules, states may make it not an offence if: (i) you reasonably thought the person was above the ‘basic’ age; or (ii) you reasonably thought you were married to the person<a href="/print/17895#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> ; or (iii) Both partners are in similar age (usually 2-5 years).<a href="/print/17895#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> In most jurisdictions if the adolescent is really, really young (i.e. 13 in England) then even these ‘minus’ elements will not be allowed as a defence.</p><p>There are therefore an almost infinite number of ways in which age of consent laws can be reformed. It is less important to know the age details of each rule in each country (16 years? 13 years? 14? 15?). It is instead very important to think about the ‘basic’, ‘plus’, and ‘minus’ ideas in age of consent laws (such as, should it be a defence if someone had sex with a really, really young girl but honestly believed she was above the legal age of consent?).</p><p>This article considers the arguments whether, in principle, age of consent rules should be made more liberal (lower or no ‘basic’ age and more generous ‘minus’ elements) or made stricter (same or higher ‘basic’ age and with less or no allowance for ‘minus’ elements).</p><div><a href="/print/17895#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Norman-Eady, Sandra, ‘Statutory Rape Laws by State’, OLR Research Report, 14 April 2003 <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2003/olrdata/jud/rpt/2003-r-0376.htm" title="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2003/olrdata/jud/rpt/2003-r-0376.htm">http://www.cga.ct.gov/2003/olrdata/jud/rpt/2003-r-0376.htm</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17895#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> ‘Worldwide ages of Consent’, AVERT: averting HIV &amp; AIDS, <a href="http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm" title="http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm">http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17895#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> ‘Q&amp;A: Age of Consent’, BBC News Online, 29 November 2000, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1045383.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1045383.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1045383.stm</a></p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17895#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> ‘Worldwide ages of Consent’, AVERT: averting HIV &amp; AIDS, <a href="http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm" title="http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm">http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm</a></p></div><div id="ftn5"><p><a href="/print/17895#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> Canadian Department of Justice, ‘Age of Consent to Sexual Activity’, justice.gc.ca, <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/dept-min/clp/faq.html" title="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/dept-min/clp/faq.html">http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/dept-min/clp/faq.html</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-editors">

                    <p>The freedom of sexual expression (and exploration) is not only a matter of choice which is fundamental to the individual &ndash; it is also particularly important to young people as they proceed through the stage of adolescence into young adulthood. Age of consent laws place artificial limits on this freedom. Sex is entirely natural and should be celebrated in the context of loving relationships, not criminalised and put under the prying eye of an authoritarian state. Violence, coercion and exploitation in sexual relationships should still be punished, but not consensual activity. Such restrictions go against the human rights to privacy and of freedom of expression.</p><p>The concept that young people do not know what they are doing is flawed, because every person who has gone through sexual development has learnt by doing. There is no process of suddenly coming into full knowledge without acting and exploration. Such exploration would be more safely done in an environment that doesn&#39;t criminalize it. Such criminalization can actaully lead to the very harm that the law ostensibly seeks to avoid, coercion and exploitation, for it is people who are naturally more inclined to coercion and exploitation that will disregard the law anyway. This feeds the lambs to the wolves.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The idea that young people should not be having sex is a leftover relic from the past: its justifications are anachronistic and have little place in modern times. Age of consent laws were the product of a ‘purity campaign’ in Britain in the 1800s, when it was believed that sex was a ‘male privilege’, that it led to the sexual ruin of young women, that it meant the loss of their virtue, which was a fate worse than death, and that it contributed to women’s second class citizenship.<a href="/print/17895#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In the UK the age of 16 was chosen and set in 1885, more than 100 years ago, and has remained ever since.<a href="/print/17895#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Today these ideas would offend both men and women.</p><div><a href="/print/17895#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Harman, Lillian, ‘Understanding the Age of Consent in the Context of the 1800’s’, Liberty No. 235, pp.3-4 from Age Of Consent, <a href="http://www.ageofconsent.com/comments/numberten.htm" title="http://www.ageofconsent.com/comments/numberten.htm">http://www.ageofconsent.com/comments/numberten.htm</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17895#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Bullough, Vern L, ‘The Age of Consent’, Journal of Psychology &amp; Human Sexuality Volume 16, Issue 2-3, 2005</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Liberals tend to assume that many young boys and girls would want to have sex if not for age of consent laws. In reality many boys and girls themselves actually do not want to have sex or sexual contact, but lack the social and emotional confidence to say ‘no’. Age of consent laws protect such children, by preventing others from putting them in such a difficult position and help them against peer pressure.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Age of consent laws are in fact dangerous because they drive underground the very people who should be, and are in most need of, receiving contraceptives, advice on safe sex, and access to health and other educational services. This is true both of the ‘statutory rapist’ as well as the under-16 consenting ‘victim’, who may worry about having assisted in the commission of a crime. Both parties then become real victims as they are put at greater risk of contracting STDs or unwanted pregnancies.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It seems important to note that the age of consent could be maintained – or raised- while allowing people who need advice on or access to contraceptives, or other services to access them. The idea would be that school students are still taught about sex, contraceptives and consequences, and doctors are to give free, impartial and –most importantly- confidential advice, and contraception to be readily available to all.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Even without resorting to a moralistic view of the criminal law (i.e. that its function is to stem moral disintegration and to uphold the ‘shared morality’ of society), there is adequate justification for age of consent laws. Society has a vital interest in ensuring that its naturally weaker members are protected from harm, and doing so is precisely the function of the persuasive and coercive powers of the criminal law. It is therefore legitimate for the law to aim to prevent sexual harm to children by criminalising sex with them. Indeed, age of consent sex laws are not the only laws dependent on age. In many countries it is also an offence, for example, to sell tobacco to children, or to employ children below a certain age in the entertainment industry, whether or not the child ‘consents’. Society must recognise the reality that the apparent expression of ‘consent’ by a child is often different from consent expressed an adult. In the case of the former, therefore, it is not always true that saying ‘yes’ is a true expression of human autonomy.</p><p>The argument that these laws may cause injustice to someone who truly thought his partner was above the legal age is also a poor one – many countries already provide a defence for such situations</p>        </div>

                    <p>Even if we can accept that children need protection from sex, is it right to use the full force of the criminal law – which includes the threat of criminal prosecution and the prospect of a criminal sentence – to do it? It is contrary to both justice and common sense for people who have merely had consensual sex with a teen who happens to be under-16 to be arrested, tried, branded with a criminal label (‘statutory rapist’, ‘sex offender’), thrown in prison, and thereby treated on the same footing as real (sometimes violent) rapists, arsonists and kidnappers.</p><p>The debate surrounding the age of consent raises the broader point of the role of the criminal law. The function of the criminal law is to preserve public order and decency, not to intervene in the lives of citizens, especially those who have mutually consented to taking part in a harmless activity in private. To accept otherwise would be to disregard the crucial notion of human autonomy and the free will of the individual, which are expressed, regardless of one’s age, each time a person presents his or her consent. This is why it is so important that the law recognises the sanctity of consent.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is undeniable that young children form a special and vulnerable group in society. Nowhere is this truer than in the context of sex – so much so that we often need to protect them by placing limitations on what they do sexually. Below a certain minimum age, children are at risk of not having the physiological, biological and, most importantly, emotional development to cope with sex, and with the many possible consequences of having sex, which include teen pregnancy, illegal or legal abortion, childbirth, parental and societal disapproval, unsupported parenthood, legal consequences and increased risk of cervical cancer.<a href="/print/17895#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Unfortunately everyone matures a different age. That does not mean that choosing an average, approximate age for consensual sex, such as 16, is arbitrary or wrong. There is no great harm in asking “early developers” to wait for a year or two before they begin to have sex. Especially young people are not always as mature as they believe they are.</p><p><a href="/print/17895#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> BBC News, ‘Cervical cancer link to early sex’, 21 December 2009, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8420690.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8420690.stm</a>,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Lowering the age of consent (or worse, getting rid of it entirely) legalises, legitimises and brings above ground the many problems that we are fighting underground. It will provide an opportunity for paedophile networks to expand, by allowing them to target even younger children – now lawfully. The problem of paedophilia is already a rapidly growing one, made worse by its expansion into ‘related’ avenues such as child pornography. In addition to the obvious problem of paedophilia, the problem of the sexual predation of young children also encompasses the problem of youth prostitution (since prostitution is itself already legal in many countries), and the international traffic in boys and girls.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Liberalising age of consent laws will not encourage paedophilia or make sexual exploitation any easier. That is simply a false nightmare scenario propagated by scaremongers. Many countries have lowered the basic age of consent while strengthening their ‘plus elements’. For example, by making ‘sexual grooming’ an offence (to stop rings of internet paedophiles); by making it an offence to have sex with a young child if you are above a certain age or if the age differential between the partners is above a certain limit (to target adult paedophiles while allowing teens their sexual freedom); and by making it an offence to have sex with someone who is in a relationship of trust of dependency with you (to stop sexual exploitation).</p>        </div>
