    <h1 class="print-title">This House would detain people on grounds of mental health</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Detention on the grounds of mental health aims to provide treatment and safety for those who are deemed unable to make an informed decision about their situation due to their mental state. The current process in the UK means that two doctors or a doctor and a social worker have to declare that it would be in the interest of the patient and society for the patient to be &#39;sectioned&#39; (meaning detained in hospital). This usually lasts for 72 hours, but can be extended by the doctor for up to 28 days (full details in scrapbook). A similar process is carried out in countries such as Australia, the USA (although the specifics vary between States) and the Netherlands. In other countries such as Germany, detention is only carried out if a guardian wishes it. Yet historically, such a method of detention has been abused by governments such as Soviet Russia using these mental health laws to detain political prisoners<sup>1</sup>. Many mental health awareness groups oppose this policy. This debate aims to discuss the positive and negative aspects and effects of detention on the grounds of mental illness, with particular reference to DSPD (dangerous severe personality disorder).</p>

                    <p>As a society we should put effort into helping those suffering from mental illness and detention is one way of being sure that they are receiving and maintain treatment. This also means that doctors are able to keep an eye on patients so that if the patient is no longer a risk, they can be let out. If patients are detained then doctors will have a better idea of their patient's usual behaviour and therefore be better at reading their symptoms.</p>        </div>

                    <p>People with mental illnesses are no more dangerous than other sectors of the population. Most people with mental health problems commit no crimes at all. There are other, far more accurate, predictors of criminal behaviour which nobody would consider to be sufficient to justify detention. The vast majority of crimes are committed by young men; 51% of violent crime and well over two-thirds of homicides are committed by people under the influence of alcohol<sup>1</sup>. Yet, rightly, the law does not permit the pre-emptive detention of young men, or of alcoholics. Why should people who have mental illnesses be treated differently?</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.ias.org.uk/resources/factsheets/crime.pdf"> Institute of Alcohol Studies. (2010, July 29).

                    <p>If people have an infectious disease that could be dangerous to others, they are put in quarantine. If we think that people are a danger to their own personal safety they are put on 'suicide watch'. In both these cases the subject has done nothing wrong, yet they are often detained in order to protect the public. Detention on the grounds of mental illness can be seen to fit into this category, it is unfortunate but necessary for the public good.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The public is at risk from people with known dangerous mental health problems. Two people are killed every month by Care in the Community patients in the UK (Care in the community described in Scrapbook). Jonathan Zito was stabbed to death by Christopher Clunis in 1992; Jason Mitchell beheaded his father and strangled two pensioners in 1994; Stephen Laudat killed his grandfather in 1994, believing him to be the gang leader Ronnie Kray; John Rous stabbed care worker Jonathan Newby to death in 1995; Michael Stone killed Lin and Megan Russell in a field near their home in 1996. All of these killers had diagnosed mental illnesses but could not be detained under UK law, yet if they had been detained many lives would have been saved. Currently, people with mental health problems who have not committed an offence may only be detained for the purposes of treatment, and may avoid treatment if they can argue that they will receive no benefit from it. There is no known effective treatment for Dangerous Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD). This means that people with DSPD fall through a gap between the criminal justice system and the healthcare system– they cannot be treated, so they never get less dangerous, but they cannot be detained, so the public cannot be protected from them. Furthermore it seems it is not unreasonable to detain people who you have good grounds to suspect could be dangerous as we already detain potentially dangerous people who do not have mental health problems anyway, if authorities believe they may be terrorists. <sup>1</sup></p><p>1.<a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/help/uk-pre-charge-detention.php">Library of Congress.

                    <p>DSPD is not a psychiatric diagnosis, but a legal category therefore it is not surprising that it cannot be treated. It is a convenient label, however, for people whom the government fears and would like to have an excuse to detain, and who are unlikely to generate strong public sympathy. Rather than demonising and detaining people, the government should be providing mental health services which work in partnership with the people they are supposed to be helping.</p>        </div>

                    <p>People who are mentally ill are significantly more of a danger to themselves than to others with only 5% of homicides being committed by people with mental illness.<sup>1</sup> Detention is one way of preventing people suffering from mental illness to harm themselves or anyone else, and this must be in the best interest of the patient. Some people who are mentally unwell may attempt to commit suicide or get caught up in a cycle of self deprecating thoughts. However, patients in detention can be monitored; therefore similarly to the issue of Argument One, it seems important to detain patients in order to save them from themselves.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/320/7233/522.1.full"> Ferriman, Annabel, 'The stigma of schizophrenia', BMJ, 19 February 2000, 320:522, Retrieved 1 September 2011 from BMJ.com: </a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Detention can never truly be in the patient's interest. Detention has been known to have damaging effects on mental health<sup>1</sup> and thus is perhaps the worst thing that could be done for the individual. The fact that DSPD is not a treatable condition means that people described as having it will, once detained, effectively be abandoned– they will not be able to be offered alternative treatment which might improve their condition and make their release more likely. Unlike other detained psychiatric patients, their detention has no clear goal and it is difficult to see how anyone could argue for their release on the grounds of improvement.</p><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncah.com.au/news-events/mental-health-nurse-sacked-over-detention-comments/765/">Nursing Careers Allied Health.

                    <p>There is a strong stigma attached to mental illness, with a widespread public perception that people with mental health problems are "dangerous nutters" or other detrimental and unfounded assumptions<sup>1</sup>. Australian research has shown that the most problematic type of news coverage about mental illness results from information collected at court or from the police.</p><p>Many of these stories focus on violence and relate to specific and relatively rare circumstances. Audiences, however, are likely to make generalisations about people with a mental illness as a result<sup>2</sup>. A German study found that students who read negative articles about mental</p><p>illness express more negative attitudes toward people with a mental illness<sup>3</sup>, this is all in spite the fact that 1 in 6 people will experience mental health problems (mentalhealth.org.uk), almost always without exhibiting violent or dangerous behaviour. Detaining people with such problems will help to feed this false perception, and will be detrimental to efforts to improve the public understanding of mental illness.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.mindframe-media.info/site/index.cfm?display=105841"> Mindframe.

                    <p>It is absolutely unacceptable to restrict the basic human right of an individual's liberty by detaining people indefinitely against their will when they have committed no crime. This is made worse when the detention will not do anything to help them with their condition (as would be the case with DSPD). We should be treating illness rather than locking them away. Assessing the risk that someone may be dangerous is an extremely difficult process, and has to be balanced against the harms they would be subjected to within indefinite detention – for example, loss of employment and family contact, loss of dignity and self-esteem, institutionalisation <sup>1</sup>. Detention in this way is merely prioritising the general public’s concern over the individual liberty of those suffering from mental illness, and it appears unjust that someone has the right to enforce that the individuals with mental health issues are less important.&nbsp;</p><p>1.<a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/EF017AA9-8B23-48DF-9326-129729CD7459/0/FICHES_Detention_and_Mental_Health_EN.pdf">European Court of Human Rights.

The process of sectioning ensures this by having two separate doctors diagnose the patient as both mentally ill and a threat to themselves or others; these diagnoses are then presented to an independent AMP (approved medical practitioner) who makes the decision about whether or not the individual can be detained. If a doctor or AMP believes this should be extended to 28 days, then the process is repeated again independently.
