    <div class="print-content"><p>Capital punishment is the sentence of death, or practice of execution, handed down as punishment for a criminal offence. It can only be used by a state, after a proper legal trial. The United Nations in 2008 adopted a resolution (62/149) calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, however fifty-eight countries, including the United States and China, still exercise the death penalty. As such, the topic remains highly controversial. Abolitionist groups and international organizations argue that it is cruel and inhumane, while proponents claim that it is an effective and necessary deterrent for the most heinous of crimes.</p>

                    <p>The state has no right to take away the life of its citizens. By executing convicts, the government is effectively condoning murder, and devaluing human life in the process. Such acts violate the right to life as declared in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights<sup>1</sup> and the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment<sup>2</sup>.<br>On top of this, the state forces executioners to actively participate in the taking of a life, which can be unduly traumatizing and leave permanent psychological scars. Thus, a humane state cannot be one that exercises the death penalty.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty">Amnesty International. "Abolish the Death Penalty."

                    <p>A just state regularly abrogates people's rights when they intrude upon the rights of others. By sentencing people to prison, for instance, the state takes away rights to movement, association, and property rights from convicted criminals. The right to life should be no different. When you commit certain heinous crimes, you forgo your right to life. This does not devalue life, but rather affirms the value of the innocent life taken by the criminal. Certain crimes are so heinous that the only proportionate sentence is execution.<br>As for the executioners themselves, there are methods of execution that involve multiple executioners which might reduce the associated psychological burdens. At any rate, no one is forced to become an executioner, and people who choose to take on that role do so with full awareness of the risks involved.</p>        </div>

The cost of death row presents an additional financial burden associated with the death penalty.<br>Savings from abolishing the death penalty in Kansas, for example, are estimated at $500,000 for every case in which the death penalty is not sought<sup>1</sup>.<br>In California, death row costs taxpayers $114 million a year beyond the cost of imprisoning convicts for life<sup>2</sup>.<br>This money could instead be better spent on measures that are of much greater benefit to the criminal justice system- greater policing, education, and other crime-preventing measures that are far more cost-effective.<br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/us/18deter.html?pagewanted=1">Liptak, Adam.

                    <p>The death penalty can also help provide closure for the victim's family and friends, who will no longer have to fear the return of this criminal into society. They will not have to worry about parole or the chance of escape, and will thus be able to achieve a greater degree of closure.<br>Mary Heidcamp, a Chicago woman whose mother's killer faced the death penalty before the State Governor commuted the sentences to life in prison, stated 'we were looking forward to the death penalty.

For example, in 1993, Alex Hernandez was sentenced to death for the kidnapping, rape and murder of a 10-year old girl in Chicago; he was released a number of years later due to his lawyers proving both a paucity of evidence and the confession of her actual killer<sup>1</sup>. As a result, very few innocent people receive the death penalty, and the legality of capital punishment does not increase wrongful or prejudicial convictions<sup>2</sup>.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/01/06/030106fa_fact">Turow, Scot.

                    <p>Juries are imperfect<sup>1</sup>, and increasing the stakes of the verdict can pervert justice in a couple of ways.<br>First, implementation of the death penalty is often impacted by jury members' social, gender-based or racial biases<sup>2</sup>, disproportionately impacting certain victimized groups in society and adding a certain arbitrariness to the justice system. A 2005 study found that the death penalty was three to four times more common amongst those who killed whites than those who killed African Americans or Latinos, while those who kill women are three and a half times more likely to be executed than those who kill men<sup>2</sup>.<br>Regional differences in attitudes towards the death penalty can also introduce elements of randomness into sentencing. For instance, in Illinois, a person is five times more likely to get a death sentence for first-degree murder in a rural area than in Cook County<sup>2</sup>.<br>Finally, the fear of wrongful execution can also pervert justice by biasing juries towards returning an innocent verdict when they would otherwise be deemed guilty<sup>3</sup>. When they are told that the consequence of a guilty verdict is death, they are likely to find some kind of reasonable doubt to avoid being responsible for the death of that criminal. This means that more criminals who would've otherwise been convicted do not get charged. In this sense the death penalty can pervert the goals of justice and prolong the difficult process for victims' families.<br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/13279051"> "Saving Lives and Money."

                    <p>The fact that juries are prone to several biases is not a flaw inherent or unique to capital punishment.<br>If there are racial or prejudicial issues in sentencing, these are likely to present themselves just as often in cases where the punishment is life in prison. It is equally problematic for people to die or spend decades in jails for crimes they did not commit. These errors suggest that the judicial process may need some reform, not that the death penalty should be abolished. Implementation errors that result in discrimination can and should be corrected.<br>Moreover, there is little evidence that these biases are even present in most death penalty cases<sup>1</sup>. A study funded by the National Institute of Justice in the US found that differences in sentencing for white and non-white victims disappeared when the heinousness of the crimes were factored into the study<sup>1</sup>. Thus, factors relating to the crime, not the race, of the accused accounted for some of the purported racial disparities that were found.<br>Finally, jurors must be "death- qualified" in such cases, meaning that they are comfortable sentencing someone to death should the fact indicate their guilt<sup>2</sup>. Thus, it is unlikely that many jurors will abstain from a guilty verdict because they are uncomfortable with the death penalty.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Testimony/The-Death-Penalty-Deters-Crime-and-Saves- Lives">Muhlhausen, David.

                    <p>The state has a responsibility to protect the lives of innocent citizens, and enacting the death penalty may save lives by reducing the rate of violent crime.<br>The reasoning here is simple- fear of execution can play a powerful motivating role in convincing potential murderers not to carry out their acts. While the prospect of life in prison may be frightening, surely death is a more daunting prospect. Thus, the risk of execution can change the cost-benefit calculus in the mind of murderers-to be so that the act is no longer worthwhile for them<sup>1</sup>.<br>Numerous studies support the deterrent effect of the death penalty. A 1985 study by Stephen K. Layson at the University of North Carolina showed that a single execution deters 18 murders. Another influential study, which looked at over 3,054 counties over two decades, further found support for the claim that murder rates tend to fall as executions rise<sup>2</sup>.<br>On top of this, there are ways to make the death penalty an even more effective deterrent than it is today. For instance, reducing the wait time on death row prior to execution can dramatically increase its deterrent effect in the United States<sup>1</sup>.<br>In short, the death penalty can- and does- save the lives of innocent people.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Testimony/The-Death-Penalty-Deters-Crime-and-Saves- Lives">Muhlhausen, David.

                    <p>There are many reasons to doubt the deterrent effect of the death penalty. For one thing, many criminals may actually find the prospect of the death penalty less daunting (and thus, less effective as a deterrent) than spending the rest of their lives suffering in jail. Death by execution is generally fairly quick, while a lifetime in prison can be seen as a much more intensive punishment.<br>Moreover, even if criminals preferred life in prison to the death penalty, it's not clear that a harsher punishment would effectively deter murders. Heinous crimes often occur in the heat of the moment, with little consideration for their legal repercussions<sup>1</sup>.<br>Further, for a deterrent to be effective, it would have to be immediate and certain. This is not the case with the death penalty cases, which often involve prolonged appeals and sometimes end in acquittals<sup>2</sup>.<br>Finally, the empirical evidence regarding the deterrence effect of the death penalty is at best mixed. Many of the studies that purport to show the deterrence effect are flawed, because the impact of capital punishment cannot be disentangled from other factors such as broader social trends, economic factors and demographic changes in a region<sup>2</sup>.<br>Other studies have even suggested a correlation between the death penalty and higher crime rates. States such as Texas and Oklahoma, which have very high execution rates, also have higher crime rates than most states that do not have the death penalty<sup>2</sup>.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty">Amnesty International.

There are crimes that are more visceral, but there are none that are more deadly. Such a heinous crime can only be punished, in a just and fair manner, with the death penalty.<br>As Time put it, 'there is a zero-sum symmetry to capital punishment that is simple and satisfying enough to feel like human instinct: the worst possible crime deserves no less than the worst possible<br>punishment'<sup>1</sup>.Human life is sacred; there must be a deterrent mechanism in place that ensures that those violating that fundamental precept are punished.

                    <p>The death penalty can help ease the problem of overcrowded prisons in many countries, where keeping people for life in prison contributes to expensive and at times unconstitutional overcrowding<sup>1</sup>.<br>In 2011, California prison overcrowding was so problematic that a district court panel ordered authorities to release or transfer more than 33,000 inmates. This decision was held up by the U.S. Supreme Court, which argued that the conditions in the overcrowded prisons are so overwhelming that they constitute cruel and unusual punishment<sup>2</sup>. Similarly, in the United Kingdom two thirds of prisons in England and Wales have been deemed overcrowded<sup>3</sup>.<br>As such, the death penalty may be preferable to life in prison since it helps alleviate a pressing problem in the criminal justice system.
