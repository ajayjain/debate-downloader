    <h1 class="print-title">This House would disclose previous convictions in court</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Under the status quo in most English-speaking jurisdictions, a defendant&rsquo;s previous convictions cannot be brought up in court until <em>after</em> the jury has given its verdict. This includes Scotland<a href="/print/24096#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Britain. This is because these countries believe that each case should be evaluated on its own merits, and that &lsquo;knowledge of previous offences would prejudice the outcome of a trial&rsquo;<a href="/print/24096#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. However, other countries such as France allow previous convictions to be disclosed before a verdict is reached<a href="/print/24096#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. Exceptions are made in Britain in cases where the case under trial is &lsquo;strikingly similar&rsquo; to a past offence, in which case it is believed that the value of the evidence &lsquo;outweighs any prejudicial effect&rsquo;<a href="/print/24096#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. Previous convictions may also be disclosed if the defendant &lsquo;falsely claims to be of good character&rsquo;<a href="/print/24096#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>. Though previous convictions are not currently disclosed before the verdict of guilty or not guilty, judges may consider previous convictions when they decide the sentence for defendants deemed guilty<a href="/print/24096#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>. There is a great interest in making sure that criminals are adequately punished for their crimes &ndash; particularly where recidivism shows that previous punishment has had little effect &ndash; in the interest of justice and public safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When choosing a mechanism for this debate, you may wish to think about the scope of argument and breadth of debate you want to have. The first option is to defend a criminal justice system which allows previous convictions to be revealed in a case of similarity to past convictions, where the defendant falsely claims good character, or where the defendant attacks the character of a prosecution witness, as is the status quo in Britain<a href="/print/24096#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>. This takes on a smaller burden for the proposition and highlights particular points where past convictions could certainly be pertinent to the case and its relevance is pinpointed. The other option is to defend the model used by France where previous convictions are routinely disclosed<a href="/print/24096#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a>. This requires the proposition to argue that the majority of cases would actively benefit from these disclosures by citing high recidivism rates after an initial offence and more general issues such as greater transparency within the courtroom. This is a wider debate with more potential for principles, rather than practical, arguments.</p>

                    <p>It is unfair that those who repeatedly re-offend should be treated in the same manner as those who have committed one offence; a singular offence could mark a mistake or accident in the defendant&rsquo;s choices, but repeated criminal acts mark a habit and a lack of regret for past crimes. Failing to take past convictions into account can lead to many dangerous offenders being underestimated by the jury, and so released. This is particularly pertinent in cases of child molestation, where child molesters have a particularly high rate of re-offending &ndash; expected to be even &lsquo;larger than the reported 50 per cent&rsquo; - but &lsquo;only a small proportion of sexual offences against children result in a conviction&rsquo;. This conviction rate, however, does rise for &lsquo;those with a history of prior sexual offences&rsquo;<a href="/print/24096#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the current conditions, this system is unfairly weighted against the innocent victims of repeated crime. A higher conviction rate, informed by the knowledge of previous offences, helps to reach justice for these victims and their families, as well as promoting justice and the safety of the general public who find it frustrating that so many dangerous offenders are released without appropriate conviction<a href="/print/24096#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Moreover, jurors themselves lose confidence in the justice system when they find out that they have just acquitted a defendant who has committed a similar crime before. One notable example of this was series of trials of Kirk Reid, who committed many sexual assaults against women including several instances of rape and who was &lsquo;wrongfully acquitted&rsquo; of his first offence in 1996. Not only did his victim lose all sense of hope in the justice system &ndash; she had faced her attacked and been discredited &ndash; but one of the jurors at the trial who believed that he was guilty went on to criticise the justice system itself<a href="/print/24096#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. The current system seriously risks acquitting criminals who have already committed similar crimes; it is time to rebalance the justice system to acknowledge the needs of the victims who suffer through wrongful acquittal of their attackers.</p>

                    <p>While recidivism is obviously a problem, this motion fails to take into account any situation where an individual has previously committed a crime but is innocent of the crime going to trial. Given that conviction rates soar when previous convictions are disclosed<a href="/print/24096#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, this motion doesn&rsquo;t rebalance the justice system to cater for the victims, but risks seriously prejudicing those who are innocent of the crime going to trial. A wrongful conviction is just as bad as a wrongful acquittal; the prejudicial effects on the jury&rsquo;s ability to make a verdict<a href="/print/24096#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> undermines the objectivity of the justice system, and seriously risks the possibility of a fair trial.</p>

                    <p>It is nonsensical to withhold evidence from a jury that might be necessary for them to reach an accurate verdict. Just because their verdict might be more prone to conviction rather than acquittal does not necessarily mean that this is an unfair or even inaccurate conclusion; given that violent offenders are likely to re-offend<a href="/print/24096#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, it may illuminate the truth rather than confuse it. Jurors should be allowed to weigh the relevance of previous convictions and compare them with the accusations of the trail at hand. A criminal justice system which currently relies on the ability of the jury to make a decision<a href="/print/24096#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> cannot legitimately choose to withhold evidence from them without innately biasing the trial itself. As the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper states, &lsquo;we want less evidence to be withheld from the courts, on the principle that relevant evidence should be admissible . . . magistrates, judges and juries have the common sense to evaluate relevant evidence and should be trusted to do so&rsquo;<a href="/print/24096#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. If we cannot trust juries to decide which evidence is relevant to the verdict and which is not, then the entire use of juries in the criminal justice system should be reconsidered.</p>

                    <p>The verdict of an individual trial should not be predicated on trials which have already been carried out and concluded. The evidence which is being &lsquo;withheld&rsquo; here is in fact irrelevant to the case at hand. While these countries recognise that juries have great value as a representative of the people<a href="/print/24096#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, it is also important to recognise that people are vulnerable to bias &ndash; as shown by the huge increase in convictions when previous offences are disclosed<a href="/print/24096#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. The benefits of disclosing past convictions is outweighed by the benefits of the jury remaining impartial as far as possible, as this is the best way to reach a fair and just verdict.</p>

                    <p>Jurors are frequently affected by media coverage of particular cases, which makes it almost impossible for them to remain impartial in the idealistic way which opposition naively believes possible. This creates a situation where the jury may be more affected by information which they have found out elsewhere &ndash; for example on the news or in newspapers &ndash; than the information which is presented to them in court. There have been some cases where jurors search the internet to find the backgrounds to their cases, despite the fact that this is not allowed<a href="/print/24096#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. This evidently reflects that jurors feel that they have not been adequately informed and so seek facts elsewhere. Given that this need has been reflected by the jurors themselves, the court should give jurors all possible information and bring previous convictions into the open to ensure that they can base their verdict on reliable fact presented in court rather than resorting to sensationalist media.</p>

                    <p>If anything, this is an argument to prevent the media from publishing and details of a case or its defendant before the trial has been carried out, or from being more proactive and disqualifying jurors who &lsquo;research&rsquo; their case before it comes to court. We should not endorse this kind of behaviour, which jurors know is not allowed, by legitimising it within court and announcing previous convictions. The harm of bias, particularly among those who would go out of their way to read about the personal history of a defendant, could be incredibly dangerous to the principle of a fair trial.</p>

                    <p>This motion could allow innocent defendants to mount a stronger case. This is because, if allowed, the previous convictions of prosecution witnesses would be admitted as evidence. In this case, if a prosecution witness falsely claims good character in opposition to the defendant, any falsity could be more easily seen and weighed by the jury. This solves a problem under that status quo where &lsquo;the threat of introducing his [the defendant&rsquo;s] previous convictions will frequently inhibit him from introducing character evidence about the prosecution witness&rsquo;<a href="/print/24096#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>; fear that the defendant&rsquo;s convictions may weigh against them where the prosecution witness remains untouchable creates a discrepancy in the justice system. However, if convictions on both sides were to be revealed anyway, then neither can falsely claim the character of the other and attempt to convince the jury of false information on this front.</p>
