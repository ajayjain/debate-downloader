    <h1 class="print-title">This house believes in a right to self-defense</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Self-defense involves defending oneself, one&#39;s property or the wellbeing of another from physical harm. The use of the right of self-defense as a legal justification for the use of force in times of danger is available in many jurisdictions, but the interpretation varies widely. The self-defense laws of modern states find their origin in the Roman Law principle of dominium whereby any attack on the members of the family or the property it owned was a personal attack on the pater familias (head of household), and thus could be defended as such. This right is recognized to varying extents in all states, and by the United Nations. The level of force one may use in self-defense, however, varies between countries, and usually centers around what constitutes &quot;reasonable force&quot;, which is a fairly nebulous term in specific application, but relatively straightforward in a broad sense. Some critics of self-defense law argue that it is outmoded, belonging to an earlier, more barbarous time, while its supporters insist that it remains a necessity in a still dangerous, modern world. Debates on self-defense revolve around the central question of whether in fact an individual has the right to defend himself his property, and others against physical attack by means of force, or whether exerting force against another, even defensively, is itself a crime.</p>

                    <p>Even when committing, or having committed, a crime an individual still has human rights that are inviolable under law and owed the protection of the state. Of course people should be punished for the crimes they commit, but this must be done through the due process of the justice system. Certainly no individual should have his rights stripped from him by another citizen, even if he himself is trying to do just that<sup>1</sup>. Assault is still assault, and murder still murder, even when it is committed in self-defense<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, condoning self-defense sends the message that criminals are subhuman, inferior even to property of "good" citizens, who assault and kill for its sake. Consideration must be given to the incentives driving criminals' activity, as many of them are pushed to break the law by the extremity of necessity, often robbing so as to be able to feed their families and themselves. To allow individuals not deputized by the law to dispense violent retaliation for crimes committed against them compromises the state's role as the ultimate arbiter of justice within a jurisdiction. For the sake of society, citizens must accept that sometimes the police will not be present to stop a crime immediately, and that it must defer to its authority to seek justice on their behalf in the aftermath if necessary. Citizens should not usurp the authority of the law in order to enact their own justice, or to take up the cause of vigilantism.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Kaufman, Whitley. 2009.

                    <p>Clearly the right of an individual to defend his life, liberty, and property from a deliberate transgressor overrides the rights of that transgressor. Often the police are not present during the commission of a crime, which gives the individual the right to intercede on his own behalf when the state fails. Criminals, in violating the rights of other citizens, break the social contract and are thus their rights are not owed the same respect when they are in the midst of committing a crime. While criminals may be owed a trial and due process after the fact, while a crime is being committed it is a citizen's right to see justice be done and to defend himself and what is his. Furthermore, self-defense is justified by intent. Individuals defending themselves do not engage criminals in order to harm them, but to defend themselves. In this distinction self-defense is necessarily justified.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The state's primary duty is to protect its citizens, and to maintain order in society. To maintain its legitimacy the state must guard the lives, liberty, and property of its citizens, who allow it to curtail their rights in exchange for its protection. When crime is committed, it is a failure of the state. But crime in the best-run state is a reality. To make up for the inadequacies and inevitable shortcomings of the state, which cannot be everywhere, individuals need the ability to make up for the shortfall of protection offered by the state. This is why self-defense is necessary<sup>1</sup>. If the state denies the right to self-defense, while providing an inadequate security service, it allows a societal injustice to go uncorrected. Furthermore, the injustice inflicted by the state is uneven, as people in areas where there are fewer police and higher rates of crime people will of necessity have to resort to self-defense more often. This is the case, for example, in inner cities where policing is limited and poverty rates high<sup>2</sup>. The need for self-defense is clear, since people are left to fend for themselves. Thus when the state fails people in poorer areas by providing them with inadequate services, it punishes them for trying to redress the failure.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Kaufman, Whitley. 2009.

                    <p>Criminals generally consider the potential for success when contemplating a crime. When they fear that potential victims will resist them violently, with even deadly force, they will take greater precautions by arming themselves more heavily, and incapacitating victims more violently so as to limit the possibility of retaliation. When self-defense is not legally accepted criminals feel less inclined to "shoot to kill". Citizens who are able, and even armed, to fight back are more dangerous, causing criminals to feel a greater need to incapacitate their victims so as to defend themselves from potential retaliation. This is particularly true if a criminal is desperate, or if his irrationality is circumscribed by addiction or other circumstance. Clearly, it is better for both victim and perpetrator that self-defense not be condoned.</p>        </div>

When one's life or health is in danger, the calculus is clearly shifted toward the side of caution. The outcome of allowing self-defense is not more dangerous criminals, but rather fewer total criminals.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Acknowledging the right to self-defense will result in some people using excessive force under the auspices of the right. Minor initial attacks can simply becomes a pretext for an excessively violent response<sup>1</sup>. This is particularly true in cases where the "defender" is using his right to defense to harm individuals toward which he is bigoted. There have been several such cases where individuals have used defense of property as a pretext for killing individuals from minority groups, as frequently occurred, for example, in the American South in the 1960s<sup>2</sup> When people are killing or maiming under the auspices of a right of defense, it becomes very difficult to assess whether he was acting within that right or not. A grave societal injustice is perpetrated when an individual effectively has the power to kill another human being for violating his property. There is a good reason that the death penalty is outlawed in most developed countries. It is because the death of every human being, criminal or otherwise, is a permanent extinguishing of a unique subjective experience. When the state condones self-defense, it inadvertently condones murder. Furthermore, when the state does not acknowledge a right to self-defense, people can still defend themselves from attack, but will have to accept whatever punishment might arise from their retaliatory action. This will necessarily diminish the level of brutality perpetrated in self-defense, as individuals will fear the consequences of over-zealous action toward criminals.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Green, Stuart. 1999.

                    <p>Laws already exist that deny people the right to use excessive force<sup>1</sup>. The right to self-defense is contingent upon necessity, so unjust invocation of the right, in order to validate violent behavior is not acceptable. Potential for abuse of a right, however, is not reason enough to abolish it. Rather, police and jurors must be more discerning in their evaluation of citizens' behavior in the aftermath of crimes<sup>2</sup>. Self-defense is rarely used as an excuse for excessive bloodletting. Rather, it is usually a just response to a violation of one's rights.</p><p>1.&nbsp;Green, Stuart. 1999.

                    <p>People must, if the state wants people to retain faith in it and its ability to uphold the principles of justice, see justice as being done. Justice is not seen when people who defend themselves are punished for the "crime" of fighting back against those who would willfully violate their rights. When the state punishes people for the "crime" of defending themselves, it appears to be taking the side of the wrongdoer. It is true that everyone has rights, even criminals, but what is seen when people are punished for defending themselves is a placing of the rights of criminal over those of the real victims, who happened not to take the abuse of their assailants lying down. The state sends a grotesque message that people should either meekly acquiesce to the demands of criminals should they threaten them or the people and things they care about, or fight back and be punished for it. That is an unconscionable choice that the state cannot legitimately expect people to make. When the state passes laws that appear unjust, it invites acts of protest, such as jury nullification. By challenging the right to self-defense, the state only serves to delegitimize itself and its laws in the eyes of its citizens.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Sometimes the state must make unpopular choices in order to defend the rights of its citizens, even those of citizens who commit crimes. Condoning self-defense means valuing the life of one person over another, and sometimes even valuing property over a human life <sup>1</sup>. The state must send the message that all people have the right to life, and that assault and killing are still crimes, even when committed in self-defense. Furthermore, some people could construe the state's acknowledgement of the right to self-defense as an endorsement of vigilantism. The state should rather focus on improving policing, so that crime does not occur.</p><p>1. Fletcher, George. 1990. Crime of Self-Defense: Bernhard Goetz and the Law on Trial.

                    <p>When an individual is under immediate threat he has every right to defend himself from an aggressor. Just as when a wild animal threatens someone's life he has the right to do whatever he can to survive, so too does the individual have the fundamental right to defend himself from another human's aggressive acts. This is a natural law, one that predates the existence of the social contract or the state. The right to self-defense extends also to the defense of other people, as it is no less a right for someone to preserve his own existence by any means necessary, but also that of others, particularly those dependent upon him, or otherwise unable to defend themselves. Furthermore, self-defense must extend to the protection of property, since it is in many ways part of an individual<sup>1</sup>. A violation of one's property is a violation of one's self. When burglars and marauders choose to violate these fundamental rights they make the conscious decision to violate other individuals. It is just and proper that citizens be permitted to fight back to protect what is theirs by right.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Carpenter, Catherine. 2003.

                    <p>The right to self-defense must be limited by the recognition of the human rights of criminals. Law places far too much emphasis on the rights of the "defender" in situations regarding self-defense, forgetting that even law-breakers have human rights<sup>1</sup>. This can result in the placing of the value of property over that of the life of an individual, which is fundamentally contrary to the concept of human rights, which must recognize human life as the cardinal value that supersedes all others. When an individual harms or kills another human being, even in self-defense, he himself has violated that human being's rights, and must face the consequences of that crime, not be let off due to an outmoded legal concept.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Fletcher, George. 1990.

                    <p>Fewer people will be injured or die trying to resist criminals if self-defense is illegal<sup>1</sup>. This is due to the fact that at present there is a cultural narrative created by the condoning of self-defense that says it is someone's right to resist criminal acts against them. In this is an implicit statement that not doing so is a sign of weakness and capitulation to crime. The dominant narrative thus instigates people into trying to fight back against assailants, even if they lack the ability to do so effectively. In jurisdictions where citizens are not legally allowed to arm themselves, they will likely lack the capacity to fight back in any meaningful way, meaning their efforts to do so would be largely ineffective while exposing themselves to substantial risk of harm. In jurisdictions where it is legal to arm oneself, criminals will simply take greater precaution in their own armament, making them more dangerous and more likely to use force. This leads to additional people being needlessly harmed. By making self-defense illegal, people do not feel the same impetus to stand up to criminals. They will be able to acknowledge that they do not have the power to fight back, and will not do so out of any feeling of moral obligation to act, leaving law enforcement to the police, who have taken the risk inherent in defending the citizenry upon themselves willingly. Clearly, without the right to self-defense fewer people will be needlessly harmed or killed in fruitless efforts at resistance.<sup>1</sup></p><p>1. Fletcher, George. 1990.

                    <p>If self-defense is not permitted it is very unlikely that criminals suddenly will not harm people. There are many bad people in society who would gladly violate the rights of others for their own benefit. Giving them license to do so and taking the power to fight back from their victims only empowers criminals. A narrative of resistance to crime and of unwillingness to sit idly by while injustice is perpetrated is a positive aspect of society. It is better for citizens to feel themselves to be empowered individuals than defenseless sheep.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Would-be criminals, when considering the commission of a crime, make an analysis of the likelihood of success and risk to themselves from their potential victims and from the state. The incentive to commit crime when it is illegal for people to defend themselves necessarily increases substantially<sup>1</sup>. Even if the criminals assume some people will defend themselves anyway, they also know that people will likely hold back rather than fight. Denying the right to self-defense leaves innocents at the mercy of criminals who would violate their rights. On the other hand, the acknowledgement of the right to self-defense deters crime, as people will be unwilling to risk their own safety in order to commit crimes.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Green, Stuart. 1999.

                    <p>People will naturally try to defend themselves, their family and their property when attacked. It is right that the state should recognize that this is the case and that this will sometimes involve applying force against an intruder. The current situation of allowing "reasonable force" is a common sense solution to the problem that allows for flexibility depending upon what the attacker is doing, it is right that this should be decided in the courts on a case by case basis rather than the government trying to work out a set of laws to determine what constitutes self-defense and what does not. Even if a right to self-defense was not recognized it would still be taken into account at trial. Juries are asked, when viewing a trial, to consider what a "reasonable man" would do in a given situation. Most jurors will surely acknowledge the right to self-defense in light of a threat to oneself, to one's loved ones, and to one's property. Even if the state were to officially invalidate self-defense, juries and citizens would still consider it as a mitigating, or entirely absolving circumstance<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Nourse, V. 2001.
