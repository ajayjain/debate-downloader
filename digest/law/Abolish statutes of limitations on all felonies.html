    <h1 class="print-title">Abolish statutes of limitations on all felonies</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>A statute of limitations is a law that prevents the prosecution of a crime once a specified amount of time has passed.&nbsp; For instance, if a rape was committed in 2020 in a jurisdiction that limited prosecutions for rape- by statute- to ten years after the crime (or possibly ten years after charges were first filed against a suspect), no charges could be filed after 2030.&nbsp; Limitations statutes vary by jurisdiction and tend to scale up based on the seriousness of the crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, accusations of child molestation and sexual assault by religious ministers have led to a number of proposals that law systems with statutes of limitations lift them and allow prosecutions to proceed irrespective of how long ago in the past an alleged crime occurred.</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

                    <p>The efforts of prosecutors and investigators should be focused on current crimes.&nbsp; Unsolved serious that are relatively recent; just a few years or months old represent a clear threat to the community. Murderers may still be at large; the proceeds of property crimes may not have been sold on. The information that professional criminals possess about the operations and efficacy of organised crime networks becomes obsolete (often dangerously so) very quickly. If we divert an excess of police and prosecutorial resources into investigating “cold cases” and historical offences, we will diminish our capacity to fight the most current problems.&nbsp; The more we spend on them, the less we can spend on education (both general and vocation teaching and drug-use prevention), regular police patrols, and other methods to prevent crime from happening in the first place.</p><p>If people have not committed another crime in the duration of the statute of limitations, it is likely that they have reformed, or that they have found a method of subsistence and a means of earning money that does not require them to commit crimes.&nbsp; We should not be overeager to put people in our already over-crowded and arguably criminogenic prison systems.<a href="/print/17758#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p>People can change over time, and we should not be held accountable forever for mistakes we made during times of desperation, or as naive children or teenagers.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17758#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> Pirius, Rebecca.&nbsp; “Criminal Statutes of Limitations.”</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>If statutes of limitations were abolished, it does not mean that police and prosecutors would be required to pursue and every single unsolved crime in their records.&nbsp; Citizens should trust the executive to make sensible decisions about which crimes should most quickly be brought to justice in order to ensure the safety of the community. Ensuring that communities remain safe and that established liberal rights are protected from criminal exploitation is, after all, the primary purpose of democratic states. There are a number of techniques that allow prosecutors to resolve crimes that fall outside of the scope of their original statute of limitations, and a wide range of benefits that result from such action.</p><p>Useful applications of an indefinite right to prosecute crimes include threatening to try mafia underlings for historical offences, in order to obtain information on their bosses; apprehending a suspected repeat offender where there is insufficient evidence to bring a conviction on a more recent crime; and situations in small jurisdictions where there are cold cases for serious crimes and no serious crimes committed lately.&nbsp; Abolishing statutes gives prosecutors another tool that can be used to protect society against crime.</p><p>If people have truly reformed, they can be sentenced leniently or the prosecutor can choose not to bring the case.&nbsp; However very few people are able to break away from a personal history defined by criminal behaviour and an economic reliance on criminal activity third party support. Over inclusive limitations on criminal prosecutions impair the utility and efficiency of the criminal justice system by preventing the authorities from intervening in the lives of individuals who might be helped to overcome drug addictions or personality disorders in a penal context. Similarly, statutes of limitations may inadvertently protect and conceal domestic abusers who are neither reformed nor repentant, but who have stopped offending because they no longer have easy access to vulnerable individuals.</p>        </div>
