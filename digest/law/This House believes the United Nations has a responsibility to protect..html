    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes the United Nations has a responsibility to protect.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Throughout the 1990s, humanitarian disasters and perceived United Nations&#39; failures in Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Kosovo led to considerable discussion of the need for military intervention to stop atrocities among civilian populations, even though this would involve overriding traditional notions of state sovereignty. In 2000 a Canadian government initiative led to the creation of an International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS), which produced a report in 2001 calling for the recognition of a Responsibility to Protect citizens on the part of both national governments and the global community<a href="/print/17699#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. This drew on existing thinking in the 1948 International Convention against Genocide, in which the United Nations and its members committed themselves to take acts to prevent and punish genocide<a href="/print/17699#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. The ICISS Report went further, however, in arguing that a vital part of sovereignty was the responsibility of the state to protect its people, and that if a government was either deliberately targeting part of its population, or failing through inaction to protect them from serious harm, then it could not claim a sovereign right of non-interference to deflect mitigating protective action by the international community.&nbsp; In effect, R2P sought to remove &lsquo;the license to kill&rsquo; from the understanding and practice of state sovereignty. The Commission then argued that if human rights were truly universal, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) against gross violations did not stop at state borders, but that the international communities were obliged to intervene to uphold these rights in particular cases of large scale loss of life or ethnic cleansing. The notion of state and international responsibility to protect was later adopted by the UN Secretary-General&#39;s High Level Panel, which argued in 2004 that the UN should take on a responsibility to protect when five criteria of legitimacy are met.<a href="/print/17699#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> The five criteria were as follow; the harm was sufficient to constitute a &lsquo;just cause&rsquo;, the primary purpose of the military action was to halt or avert this threat (a &lsquo;right intention&rsquo;), the military option was a &lsquo;last resort&rsquo;, the means used were &lsquo;proportional&rsquo; to the objective and finally, that the operation had a &lsquo;reasonable prospect&rsquo; of success<a href="/print/17699#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. If those criteria could be met, they argued, the United Nations collectively, should act.</p>

                    <p>Citizens should be protected by individual governments, however if governments are either partaking in or failing to prevent genocide and mass atrocities, then another global actor needs to take action. The United Nations should take on this responsibility to protect people when their governments are unable or unwilling to do so, in order to prevent mass killings, genocide and other atrocities<a href="/print/17699#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. If we believe human rights have any meaning at all, then they must be universal and therefore our obligation to protect citizens from such horrors must apply regardless of state boundaries. Moving from a situation where the UN placed the rights of states above those of their people, to one where individual rights are given the greater priority is surely morally essential.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17699#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect, “Implementing the Responsibility to Protect”, <a href="http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/about-rtop#sg_report">http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/about-rtop#sg_report</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There is a procedural contradiction in the Proposition's position. If there is a universal responsibility to protect, why must this only be exercised through the United Nations, dependent upon Security Council recognition of a crisis and support for action? The United States believes that in some cases it would be right for individual states, or coalitions of the willing to take action to protect innocent life elsewhere in the world, even if the Security Council refused to deliver on its promises. Under the proposition, NATO's intervention in Kosovo in 1998/99 was wrong, and so was Vietnam's in Cambodia against the Khmer Rouge, Tanzania's in Uganda to stop Idi Amin's bloodshed, etc. - none of these had Security Council support.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Governments and leaders who are considering attacks on their own people, or who are wavering in their commitment to defend them from harm, will be aware that ignoring their own obligations could bring swift action from the international community. Only once their ability to hide behind claims to absolute sovereignty has been removed will human rights have to be taken seriously by dictators and extremist regimes. Thus by adopting a strong UN position on the Responsibility to Protect, we can hope to make states take their own responsibilities more seriously and make the need for any actual intervention rare. For example, Omar Al-Bashir of the Sudan has committed horrible atrocities against his own people. He is complicit in committing genocide against Darfur populations, yet remains in power. There is a warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court, but they have little ability to act upon their threats<a href="/print/17699#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. &nbsp;A strong commitment to the responsibility to protect would ensure leaders like Bashir think twice before permitting such atrocities to take place, through fear for their own grip on power. &nbsp;</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17699#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> New York Times (2011), “Omar Hassan al-Bashir”, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/omar_hassan_al_bashir/index.html">http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/omar_hassan_al_bashir/index.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>An apparently strong UN obligation to intervene in order to protect innocents will not necessarily provide a positive, deterrent effect. Rather, it could merely serve as an incentive for dictators and generals to commit their atrocities quicker. For example, when the United Nations first considered intervention in Libya, Colonel Qaddafi responded by strengthening the crackdown on protestors and preparing for an all-out assault on the Eastern town of Benghazi<a href="/print/17699#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. The intent to protect civilians in this case served only to increase the will of the leader to harm them. Furthermore, many of the nasty or failing regimes who might be fearful of intervention have a Security Council patron whom they can rely upon to prevent any action being taken against them. If the UN has an obligation to act to prevent atrocities such as genocide, then vetoes will be used to prevent the Security Council recognizing that such a situation exists in the first place. Though it has recently joined UN resolutions on Sudan, China blocked moves to impose sanctions on Sudan before 2007, largely due to favorable economic ties with the state<a href="/print/17699#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Finally, this proposal may make atrocities more likely, by encouraging rebel groups to provoke ill-disciplined government forces into committing gross human rights violations, such as massacres, in the hope that such a response will draw in international forces on their own side.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17699#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Buck, T. &amp; Clover, C.

                    <p>A blanket commitment could lead the United Nations and the word into great dangers. It must be considered whether intervention with force is always practical. For example, in the past China's government has committed horrific human rights abuses, such as the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution and the Tiananmen Square massacre. These surely show a state unable or unwilling to protect its citizens and would have invited intervention under this proposal. Or perhaps you feel these are purely historical examples - but what if the Chinese regime in future used horrific force to put down future risings by Uighur or Tibetan ethnic minorities? Or what about present Russian behavior in Chechnya? Would the UN really deliver on an intervention in members of the security council? Where do they draw the line? How do they decide which countries have revoked sovereignty with their actions? How many people have to die? One of the concerns with the NATO invasion in Libya is that it sets a dangerous precedent<a href="/print/17699#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.

                    <p>It is not difficult to set up basic guidelines as to determining when a situation has gone too far.

Questions like ‘how many have to die?’ are therefore not asking the right questions because the loss of life could be relatively small (it also assumes that only killing matters) if all the criteria are fulfilled.

                    <p>We can no longer argue that sovereignty must be considered absolute. Sovereignty was created as the means by which states justified the control of their territory to prevent foreign aggression. Since the creation of the United Nations, sovereignty is no longer as necessary to protect states, as most wars are not about territorial acquisition. Now it is primarily a barrier to the international community intervening when the state is abusing its own population. A better principle is if governments today are unable or unwilling to perform the duty to protect their people from harm (including state-imposed harm), then their claims to sovereignty lose their moral force and intervention becomes justified<a href="/print/17699#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. For example, Qaddafi of Libya was likening his citizens to cockroaches and rats, threatening to kill them house-by-house whilst speaking of his intent to indiscriminately attack the population of Benghazi<a href="/print/17699#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. As such, there was significant concern that violence would have devastating impacts on Libyan civilians. The United Nations, in response, authorized NATO action<a href="/print/17699#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. Through unleashing state military assets to attack his own population, Qaddafi made it clear that he was not a fit leader.

                    <p>That creates a slippery slope. When does the UN draw the line that a government has revoked its sovereignty? How many people have to die? How can it be justified that only if x number of people die, then we will intervene? Additionally, as soon as the UN gets involved in a civil war or dictatorship and has deemed the government no longer sovereign, then who is in charge? Is the UN going to set up a new government and country in the aftermath?

                    <p>It is immoral to let people die when something can be done about it. It inherently values the lives of victims of genocide and civil war less than other lives. &nbsp;The world and the United Nations have for too long stood by and watched atrocities unfold. Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur are all horrible examples where genocide and other appalling violations of human rights were inflicted upon civilian populations while the UN failed to act<a href="/print/17699#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Clearly in all the past cases where action might have saved lives and delivered hundreds of thousands of people from evil, no action was taken by the Security Council. Therefore those who argue that future challenges should be considered purely on a case-by-case basis must accept that this is likely to mean yet more refusals to act decisively and so more needless suffering. We must place an obligation to act on the Security Council so that they are predisposed to respond seriously and swiftly in future. If there is a known atrocity going on in the international community, the Security Council should no longer be allowed to ignore it based on their individual ties. For example China could not defend the Sudan even though they have close financial ties when intervention for human rights abuses is the norm<a href="/print/17699#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. The world responded to the holocaust saying ‘never again’, yet similar ethnic cleansing has happened over and over again, and in defense of human rights the UN needs to adopt a no tolerance policy. Countries who are not prepared for this obligation should step down from the Security Council.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17699#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Prevent Genocide, “Past Genocides”, <a href="http://www.preventgenocide.org/edu/pastgenocides/">http://www.preventgenocide.org/edu/pastgenocides/</a> <span class="print-footnote">[17]</span></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17699#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Aljazeera (2011), “China Bolsters Economic Ties with Sudan”, <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2011/06/201162952034878959.html">http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2011/06/201162952034878959.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The United Nations does have a problem raising sufficient money, troops and resources to meet its present needs for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. This is precisely because all such operations are dealt with on a case-by-case basis - the approach so beloved of the opposition for dealing with any challenge. Without a clear global commitment to the Responsibility to Protect, the UN will always be scrabbling scrambling around to meet its needs in dealing with individual crises. Once there is clear agreement on the kind of situation which will in future prompt intervention, the UN can begin to plan ahead to build up resources, create contingency funds, and seek pledges of military units from member states, to be activated swiftly as needed. This could most easily be done regionally through the regional security organizations such as NATO and the African Union that it was originally intended would provide this kind of security.
