    <h1 class="print-title">This House would strike out three-strikes laws</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Crafted in response to rising crime rates and high rates of recidivism, mandatory sentencing laws targeting repeat offenders began to appear during the early 1990s. In order to ensure that serious offenders were sentenced to longer periods of time, these statutes severely limited the degree of latitude which judges were allowed to exercise in sentencing.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most controversial such policy was adopted by the state of California in 1994. That year&rsquo;s Proposition 184 introduced what has become known as the &ldquo;three-strikes&rdquo; rule. Intended to target habitual offenders, Prop 184 mandates that any offender who is found guilty of a third felony after being convicted of two separate serious or violent felonies must receive a minimum sentence of 25-years-to-life.</p>
<p>Though half the states and the federal government have enacted their own versions of &ldquo;three-strikes&rdquo; for repeat offenders, the legitimacy of three-strikes laws remains an open question. Crime rates have declined to historic lows in California, but academics disagree over the degree to which three-strikes is responsible for the decrease in serious crime.&nbsp; In addition, the constitutionality of three-strikes laws were challenged in the 2003 Supreme Court case <em>Ewing v. California</em>, though eventually upheld in a narrow 5-4 decision. With incarceration rates on the rise and state budgets tightening each year, these statutes remain a pressing concern both as a matter of principle and of practicality.</p>

                    <p>Mandatory sentencing laws prevent judges from taking into consideration aggravating and mitigating circumstances when imposing punishment. This is because by nature, fixed penalties must ignore whether mandatory sentences have “beneficial or deleterious effects on the victims and on the family and associates of the defendant” <sup>1</sup>.&nbsp; At times, this results in greater injury to society than a more lenient alternative. Instead sentencing should be much more flexible to take into account all the different circumstances of a case and the nature of the crime.&nbsp;</p><p>1.Stith 1998</p>        </div>

                    <p>By mandating extraordinarily long sentences, three strike laws contribute to the problem of overcrowding in prisons. While inmates who have received life sentences under such statutes are permanently removed from society, studies “show that overcrowded and poorly regulated prisons tend to have higher rates of rape andsexual violence” <sup>1</sup>. Those inmates who have received lighter sentences are, furthermore, less likely to receive access to proper rehabilitative programs, to such an extent that “studies have demonstrated a correlation between overcrowding and increased recidivism.” <sup>1</sup></p><p>1.

In particular, <strong>“</strong>California’s three strike legislation reduces felony arrests rates among the class of criminals with two strikes by 15-20% per year with some estimates as high as 30%... the two strike provision of the law deters on the order of... 12,712 crimes per year” <sup>1</sup>.</p><p>1.Helland 2006.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Three strikes laws ensure that punishments are not dependent on the whim of a particular judge, but are imposed with uniform harshness on all offenders. By increasing the general duration of sentences received by recidivists and ensuring that justice is served in equal measure on each, the criminal justice system is able<strong>“</strong>to enhance deterrence through the use of longer and more certain sentences... no longer [are] judges allowed to sentence offenders as they deemed appropriate... by increasing the certainty of punishment they... increase deterrence” <sup>1</sup>.</p><p>1.Levinson, David.

                    <p>Increasing the severity of a punishment does little to increase deterrence.&nbsp; Though minimum sentencing laws result in the imposition of far harsher punishments than would be handed down otherwise, they are an ineffective means of increasing deterrence. While some potential offenders might be dissuaded by the threat of a third strike, the prevalence of this effect is minimized by the simple fact that criminals do not expect to be caught. Indeed, “the empirical support for the deterrent effect of certainty is far stronger than that for severity... Increasing the perceived risk of apprehension, that is increasing the certainty of arrest through the visible deployment of more police officers, will reduce the incidence of crime” <sup>1</sup> far more effectively than even the most draconian of sentencing statutes.</p><p><sup>1</sup>Bergstrom, Mark H.

                    <p>Three strikes laws mandate that courts impose upon offenders a lengthy minimum sentence upon conviction of a third offense. In California, the first two strikes must be considered serious or violent, but the mandatory minimum sentence of 25-years may be imposed upon conviction of any third felony offense.&nbsp; In <em>Ewing v. California </em>(2003), a four-time felon received the mandatory minimum sentence upon conviction of stealing three golf clubs with a combined total value of less than $1,200.&nbsp; Regardless of how severe a view one takes of recidivism, such a punishment is clearly excessive and grossly disproportionate to the current offense.&nbsp; Allowing mandatory minimum sentences to be applied in cases like this undermines the integrity of the criminal justice system.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Recidivists should receive increasingly severe sentences in order to protect the general public It is not imprisonment that undermines the integrity of the criminal justice system, but the failure of the system to keep the public safe.&nbsp; Research has found that habitual adult offenders commit a large percentage of crimes, and that a majority of inmates who are released from prison are likely to reoffend within a short period of time <sup>1</sup>.

                    <p>Whether one perceives punishment as a means of obtaining retribution or social harmony, justice requires that recidivists be treated with particular severity. Not only have they demonstrated a complete lack of regard for the social order through their repeated flouting of the law, but they present a greater threat than any other offenders to future stability. Indeed, as explained in the 1966 Supreme Court case Spencer v. Texas, “a defendant's prior crimes should lead to enhanced punishment for any subsequent offenses. Recidivist statutes embody four traditional rationales for imposing penal sanctions. A man's prior crimes are thought to aggravate his guilt for subsequent crimes, and thus greater than usual retribution is warranted. Similarly, the policies of insulating society from persons whose past conduct indicates their propensity to criminal behaviour, of providing deterrence from future crime, and of rehabilitating criminals, are all theoretically served by enhanced punishment according to recidivist statutes.”</p>        </div>

Sentencing enhancements imposed on the basis of prior convictions are therefore a violation of the Fifth Amendment prohibition of double jeopardy, as “sentencing enhancements are a form of punishment, and an individual who receives a recidivism enhancement based on a prior conviction suffers two punishments for the same offense” <sup>1</sup>. Those who have already served prison terms have been punished in full measure for their previous crimes, and ought to be treated accordingly.</p><p><sup>1</sup>Hessick, Carissa B., and F.

                    <p>Three strikes laws bolster economic productivity in the long run. Crime, violent and otherwise, undermines economic growth both directly and indirectly. Beyond the material consequences of theft, property destruction and bodily harm, it casts entire communities into fear and misery. In addition, the cost of crime is magnified more than ten-fold when the actual losses incurred by the victim are added to the intangible losses, such as pain and suffering, lost income, poor mental health, and diminished quality of life.&nbsp; Some of these costs are incurred by the victim, but often they are borne by the government and society at large&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp; Given that three-strike offenders are prolific criminals, incarcerating this small population for long periods of time will generate savings that far exceed the costs of incarceration. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>1.Miller, Cohen, and Wiersema, 1996</p>        </div>

                    <p>While crime is damaging to society punishment is extremely costly. Three strikes laws require that states spend vast quantities of resources to keep convicts imprisoned for often unnecessarily-long durations. Hence, “repealing these laws and reinstating greater judicial discretion would allow non-violent offenders to be sentenced to shorter terms or to serve in community corrections programs (such as parole or probation) in lieu of prison or jail” <sup>1</sup>. Insofar as federal, state and local governments in 2008 “spent nearly $75 billion on corrections, with the large majority on incarceration” <sup>1</sup>, they cannot afford to waste resources on the unnecessary incarceration of thousands.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Schmitt, John, Kris Warner, and Sarika Gupta.
