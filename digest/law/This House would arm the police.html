    <div class="print-content"><p>Most police officers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, and New Zealand (as well as in some other, smaller countries) are routinely unarmed, whereas in the rest of the world, policemen are routinely armed. In the UK, some officers, such as those involved in diplomat protection work or airport/border security and anti-terrorism work do more routinely carry firearms, and armed response officers ( subject to certain authorisation protocols), can be quickly deployed as the need arises.&nbsp; In other countries such as the United States, police weapons are frequently cited in relation to issues about police ‘militarization’ and concerning the abuse of police power—often the victimization of certain ethnic communities—and so there are sometimes calls for a reduction in police reliance on firepower and/or the adoption of other ‘less-lethal’ force technologies.&nbsp; Yet, in a rapidly changing society, where terrorism and armed crime (and, not least, police protection) remain pressing issues, it is questioned whether having unarmed police is anything more than naïve idealism.</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-curator">

                    <p>Arming the police can lead to a spiral of violence.&nbsp;In places where the police are not routinely armed, a portion of criminals will not arm themselves (since, for example, armed robbery often carries a higher sentence than robbery). Once the police are armed, criminals who do not match their capability operate under a strong disadvantage. Therefore, when the police become routinely armed, the criminal world fully arms itself in response.<a href="/print/17756#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a><br>The mere fact of increased weapons possession (by both police and criminals) will in itself result in higher use, since in circumstances where arms may not be currently used (e.g. a police chase), either side carrying weapons will mean that they consider shooting an option which they did not formerly possess. A study comparing police dispute resolution in Norway and Sweden (the former unarmed, the latter armed)<a href="/print/17756#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> tended to confirm that where police have guns, they are much more likely to use them – the Swedish police shot significantly more suspects.&nbsp; Thus gun availability effectively reduces the options currently available to police along the ‘continuum of force’. &nbsp;For example, if the police are armed, they are less likely to use less harmful alternatives such as tasers, “stun guns”, CS spray, and negotiation, even though the lowered lethality of a technology generally seems to imply it will be used more frequently.<a href="/print/17756#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17756#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Talking Point, ‘Should British police carry guns?’, <em>BBC News</em>, 12 February 2001, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/1156341.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/1156341.stm</a> accessed 20 September 2011</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17756#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Knutson , J and Strype J. 2003 Police use of Firearms in Norway and Sweden Policing and Society Vol. 13(4) pp. 429-439.</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17756#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Porter Henry, ‘Should the police ever shoot to kill?’ <em>Liberty Central</em>, 13 May 2009, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/henryporter/2009/may/13/keith-richards-shoot-to-kill">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/henryporter/2009/may/13/keith-richards-shoot-to-kill</a>, accessed 20 September 2011</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The old-fashioned notions of friendly neighborhood unarmed policing reflect the aspirations of a different age. As armed violence has increased sharply in parts of the developed world, the police need to redefine their role so that it is a more appropriate response to contemporary problems. In the UK, for example, gun crime almost doubled in the decade to 2008,<a href="/print/17756#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> while the rise in London gun crime has tripled, the police need to be able to respond to this.<a href="/print/17756#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> &nbsp;There is also danger in being a state with unarmed police when others states have armed police forces.

                    <p>The police should not be reacting in such a way that they exacerbate those problems. By routinely arming its police officers, the state effectively legitimizes the weapon as a symbol of authority. Whether or not this is pragmatic, it is an implied affirmation of the criminal sub-culture, which will accordingly be strengthened.</p><p>The argument about a rapid increase in gun crime in the UK depends upon a very limited and selective use of crime data.&nbsp; Recorded gun crime did indeed rise by close to 105% between 1998 (when handguns were banned in the UK after the Dunblane tragedy) and 2003, but a large proportion of that increase is attributable to air weapon misuse and non-firing replica weapons.<a href="/print/17756#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp; Since then the increase has largely stabilised and even fallen. A temporary trend, now brought under control, is not necessarily a strong argument for changing, for ever, the nature and character of British policing.</p><p>By this policy—especially in the absence of a Constitutional right for citizens to bear arms—the role of the police is essentially defined in opposition to at least part of the citizenry. This can be contrasted to the more common expectation that police and citizens operate under essentially common rules, for shared values and that policing is undertaken in a spirit of the minimum use of force and by ‘public consent’.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17756#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Squires, P. 2008&nbsp; <em>Gun Crime: a Review of Evidence and Policy</em>, Centre for Crime and Justice Studies <a href="http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/guncrime.html">http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/guncrime.html</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There is a global increase in gun ownership, even in countries which did not traditionally think of themselves as having a large criminal gun culture.&nbsp; Presently 1.8 million legally held guns are accounted for in the UK.<a href="/print/17756#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This increases the risks to frontline police officers of being the victims of gun crime. Police officers should have a right to protect themselves. Fewer officers may die on duty if they were better able to protect themselves. Arming the police is essentially a matter of self-defence rather than being actively involved in regular firearms incidents. This is shown by the fact that most routinely armed police never fire their weapon on active duty in their whole career.<a href="/print/17756#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> If being a police officer is a safer job, then there will be a larger applicant pool to choose from, and thus better, more qualified police forces.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17756#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Legal Community Against Violence, ‘Large Capacity Ammunition Magazines’, 2011, <a href="http://www.lcav.org/content/large_capacity_ammunition_magazines.pdf">http://www.lcav.org/content/large_capacity_ammunition_magazines.pdf</a>, accessed 20 September 2011</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17756#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> BBC News, ‘Q&amp;A: Armed police in the UK’, 8 June 2010, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10260298">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10260298</a>, accessed 20 September 2011</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>When a police officer carries a weapon, she faces the risk of having that weapon turned on her by a criminal. It is also more obvious to a criminal that they need to shoot first against an armed officer whereas against an unarmed one they may be more open to listening and less likely to try and pre-empt being shot. So arming the police can sometimes make the police more vulnerable, rather than more protected.</p><p>If, as the opposing argument suggests, legally owned guns are part of the risk profile facing the police, measures ought to be taken to reduce the risk and restrict levels of gun ownership.&nbsp; The police have had a National (legal) Firearms Database since 2006 allowing them to assess whether someone they will be dealing with is a gun owner or whether the premises they are attending contains licensed firearms. Criminal misuse of illegal firearms is a different matter although, as has been argued, protection and safety are not the same as ‘armed’ and more armed police will probably mean more shootings and, equally probably, more mistakes and armed confrontations.<a href="/print/17756#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17756#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> P.

The police would no longer be viewed as ‘upholding the peace’ but rather enforcing through threat.</p><p>Even worse than the distancing effect, lethal weaponry is also a potent symbol of brutality.

Recruitment may well be adversely affected if the police are armed; many current officers opposed to this measure may leave, and others like them will not apply to join the force in the future.
