    <h1 class="print-title">This House would as the United States ban assault weapons</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Following the horrific killing of 26 elementary school children and teachers in Newtown, Connecticut, by Adam Lanza using a Bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle, that resulted in all his victims being hit more than once<a href="/print/45255#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, Dianne Feinstein has said that she will introduce a bill in the Senate to ban assault weapons. The United States has had an assault weapons ban before; from 1994 to 2004. The ban however lapsed in 2004 as it was set in motion for only ten years unless it was renewed, which Congress decided not to do. Feinstein says that the new bill will “take my bill from '94 to 2004 and perfect it.”<a href="/print/45255#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Detailed below is a summary of the 1994 assault weapons ban in the United States, which states "Title XI, Subtitle A of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 imposed a 10-year ban on the “manufacture, transfer, and possession” of certain semiautomatic firearms designated as assault weapons (AWs). The ban is directed at semiautomatic firearms that have features that appear useful in military and criminal context and rifles but unnecessary in shooting sports or self-defence (examples include flash hiders, folding rifle stocks, and threaded barrels for attaching silencers). The law bans 18 models and variations by name, as well as revolving cylinder shotguns. It also has a “features test” provision banning other semiautomatics having two or more military-style features…</p><p>The ban also prohibits most ammunition feeding devices holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition (referred to as large capacity magazines, or LCMs). Aloln LCM is arguably the most functionally important feature of most AWs, many of which have magazines holding 30 or more rounds. The LCM ban’s reach is broader than that of the AW ban because many non-banned semiautomatics accept LCMs. Approximately 18% of civilian-owned firearms and 21% of civilian-owned handguns were equipped with LCMs as of 1994.”<a href="/print/45255#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><p>The previous ban exempted assault weapons and large capacity magazines manufactured before the law’s 1994 introduction. Leaving the loophole that older guns could still be imported with the result that 4.7 million pre-ban LCMs were imported into the USA from 1995 through 2000.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> This is a loophole Feinstein claims would be eliminated in the new bill as "it will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession.&nbsp; Not retroactively but prospectively. And it will ban the same for big clips, drums or strips of more than 10 bullets."<a href="/print/45255#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> However as the ban won’t be retroactive it will not take assault weapons off the streets entirely if it was to be passed; its most significant result could potentially be as a stepping stone if it were to show some value in the regulation of firearms.</p><p>Any attempt to renew the ban would be controversial, even after two large scale shootings, one in Aurora and the other in Newtown. The National Rifle Association is a powerful lobbying group that would fight any attempt to ban assault weapons. Indeed progress has in recent decades been going in favour of reaffirming the right to hold arms not to limit it. In District of Columbia v. Heller the Supreme court ruled that the right to possess a firearm was unconnected with service in a militia and so overturned a ban in the District of Columbia on handguns<a href="/print/45255#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> and in 2010 it was ruled in McDonald v Chicago that the second amendment is incorporated under the fourteenth amendment so the right to bear arms is protected from infringement by local and state government as well as federal government.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></p><p>n.b. while this debate is assuming that retroactively banning assault weapons will not be on the table if it was this would make proposition’s case much easier as it is rather a large loophole and many of the arguments would be much more powerful with a more complete ban.</p><p><a href="/print/45255#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Date, Jack, ‘Adam Lanza Shot Victims at Close Range with Semi-Automatic Rifle’, <em>ABCNews</em>, 15 December 2012, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/connecticut-shooter-adam-lanza-mothers-guns/story?id=17984499#.UM9b72_r18E">http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/connecticut-shooter-adam-lanza-mothers-guns/story?id=17984499#.UM9b72_r18E</a></p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/45255#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Simpson, Connor, ‘Dianne Feinstein Wants to Ban Assault Weapons’, <em>the Atlantic Wire</em>, 16 December 2012, <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/12/dianne-feinstein-wants-ban-assault-weapons/60033/">http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/12/dianne-feinstein-wants-ban-assault-weapons/60033/</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/45255#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Koper, Christopher S., et al., ‘An Updated Assessment of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban: Impacts on Gun Markets and Gun Violence, 1994-2003’, <em>Report to the National Institute of Justice, United States Department of Justice</em>, June 2004, <a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/research/aw_final2004.pdf">http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/research/aw_final2004.pdf</a> p.1</p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/45255#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> ibid</p></div><div id="ftn5"><p><a href="/print/45255#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> Simpson, Connor, ‘Dianne Feinstein Wants to Ban Assault Weapons’, <em>the Atlantic Wire</em>, 16 December 2012, <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/12/dianne-feinstein-wants-ban-assault-weapons/60033/">http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/12/dianne-feinstein-wants-ban-assault-weapons/60033/</a></p></div><div id="ftn6"><p><a href="/print/45255#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="">[6]</a> Shukla, Raj Zal, ‘This House would ban handguns in Washington D.C.’, <em>Debatabase</em>, 2012,&nbsp; <a href="http://idebate.org/debatabase/debates/law/house-would-ban-handguns-washington-dc">http://idebate.org/debatabase/debates/law/house-would-ban-handguns-washington-dc</a></p></div><div id="ftn7"><p><a href="/print/45255#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" title="">[7]</a> ‘McDonald et al. v.

                    <p>Put simply assault weapons are designed for assault, therefore their proliferation should be prohibited in law. To put things into the general context of gun crime within the United States every year 17,000 people are killed, 70 percent of them with guns and nearly 20,000 people commit suicide by shooting themselves<a href="/print/45255#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Murder by gunfire particularly affects children, in total well over a million Americans have died in this manner and 80 people continue to be shot in the states every day. So some form of gun control is necessary and a ban on assault weapons is a good starting point.</p>
<p>Out of 62 mass murders since 1982 almost half the weapons used, 67 out of 142, were semi-automatic handguns and more than 30 were assault weapons.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The period of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban from 1994-2004 with the exception of 1999, the year of the Columbine massacre (which notably involved a semi-automatic produced before the ban), was also a peaceful period in terms of numbers of mass shootings.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> While assault weapons are responsible for a relatively small amount of total gun deaths in the USA that is not a good reason for not banning them; any life saved is worthwhile. Taking the low estimate of 1% of deaths from assault weapons that still means 90-100 people a year while the high 7%<a href="/print/45255#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> means 630-700 lives that could be saved.</p>
<p>Australia shows the advantages on implementing restrictions on guns (in Australia&rsquo;s case much stricter than anything being contemplated in this debate so the effect would not be as pronounced). In the wake of a mass shooting in Port Arthur in 1996 strict gun laws were implemented. An evaluation by the Australian National University found laws saved $500 million and halved the number of people killed by guns saving 200 lives every year.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p>

                    <p>It is exactly correct that deaths as a result of assault weapons are a tiny portion of the total firearms deaths. There is also no way to know if those who were killed by these weapons would have been saved or whether their assailant would not simply have killed them with a handgun instead. Therefore to ban only certain types of guns does not address the issue satisfactorily because it does not take into consideration that any gun can kill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hard truth is disturbed people with easy access to guns kill people, and when there&#39;s an assault weapon involved it&#39;s clear that disturbed people with easy access to military weapons can kill lots of people.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Brian Miller. BBC interview. September 13th, 2004 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3652226.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3652226.stm</a> - </strong>&quot;My brother was an FBI agent working on a cold-case homicide squad at Washington DC Metropolitan Police Headquarters on 22 November 1994. That morning a man - actually looking for a different office - walked into DC Police Headquarters, went upstairs, opened the door and opened fire with his assault pistol which was a Mac-10.</p>
<p>He was able to do this because the Mac-10 is small enough to hide underneath the jacket he was wearing but powerful enough to fire off dozens of bullets in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>When the smoke cleared and the room could be entered, which was actually a couple of hours later because of the danger involved, my brother Mike&#39;s partner - another FBI agent, a female FBI agent, was dead, a DC police sergeant was dead, a third FBI agent was grievously wounded and the shooter had been killed in the gunfight as well.</p>
<p>I felt that [these weapons should be banned], I think, before this all happened but having experienced this in a more direct fashion, I certainly feel it more strongly now.</p>
<p>These are guns that are beyond what is acceptable in my view and frankly in the view of the vast majority of Americans in terms of what&#39;s acceptable in a civil society.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Assault weapons ban works: Plug holes and let law live USA Today, 7 September 2004 <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2004-09-07-assaultweapons-ourview_x.htm">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2004-09-07-assaultweapons-ourview_x.htm</a></strong> - Fewer assault weapons at crime scenes. Since enactment of the law, the number of assault weapons traced to crime scenes has dropped 45%, according to Crime Gun Solutions LLC, a consulting firm.</p>
<p>Fewer gun fatalities. Deaths caused by guns dropped from 38,505 in 1994 to 29,573 in 2001, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While crime experts say the drop resulted from several factors, such as fewer gang shootings involving crack cocaine, they cite the assault weapons ban and other gun controls passed in 1993 and 1994 as among the causes.</p>

Wohlferd. &quot;Much Ado About Not very much: The Expiration of the Assault Weapons Ban as an act of Legislative Responsibility.&quot; May 19th, 2005 </strong><a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/ecm_dlv1/groups/public/@nyu_law_website__journals__journal_of_legislation_and_public_policy/documents/documents/ecm_pro_060716.pdf">https://www.law.nyu.edu/ecm_dlv1/groups/public/@nyu_law_website__journals__journal_of_legislation_and_public_policy/documents/documents/ecm_pro_060716.pdf</a><strong> - </strong>&quot;A. Marginal Reduction in Lethality The term &#39;assault weapon&#39; is itself intimidating, conjuring images of the powerful, rapid-fire weapons used by the military or in&#39;&quot; LEGISLATION AND PUBLIC POLICY [Vol. 8:471 action films.35 These images increase fear in the public consciousness, but do not reflect the reality of assault weapons as defined by the federal government.36 In fact, the weapons banned under the AWB are not actually automatic weapons&mdash;they cannot fire more than one round per pull of the trigger.37 Guns that fire more than one round per trigger-pull have been heavily regulated since the 1930s, and nothing in the AWB affected these firearms.38 Although they are dubbed &#39;military- like,&#39; they are not military weapons used by conventional militaries.39 Assault weapons, as defined by the AWB,40 are functionally the same as other semiautomatic guns. They fire no faster than other semiautomatic firearms not prohibited by the AWB.41 Moreover, gun control advocates&rsquo; contention that semiautomatic weapons fire at an extraordinary rate is untenable; a U.S. Navy Seal study shows they fire roughly one-tenth of a second faster than bolt-action weapons.42 Furthermore, when a weapon is actually aimed, the rate of fire is only about one shot per second on target.43 Thus, the fear of hundreds of rounds being fired in a matter of seconds is unfounded. The AWB did prohibit large capacity clips,44 and in that sense did reduce the firing rate of guns. However, the delay in firing caused by smaller ammunition clips is marginal due to the split second it takes for the shooter to press the release button and lock in a &ldquo;new fully-loaded clip.&#39;45</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ammunition used in assault weapons is not uniquely lethal compared to the ammunition used in other weapons permitted by the federal government.46 The two major factors that determine the destructive force of a round are its weight and velocity, 47 and rounds fired by assault weapons have less weight and a lower velocity than rounds used in many hunting rifles.48 Because assault weapons are not automatic weapons, they do not spray ammunition at nearly the destructive force of an ordinary shotgun firing buckshot.49 Therefore, looking purely at the firing rate and power of the firearms included under the AWB, the nineteen banned weapons are less dangerous than many weapons left untouched by the ban.</p>
<p>The second prong of the AWB prohibited firearms with at least two of the listed characteristics, such as a folding stock, a pistol grip, a threaded muzzle, a bayonet mount, or a grenade launcher.50 However, these criteria have little connection to the dangerousness of the weapon&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Rachel Alexander, Columnist and Legal Analyst. &quot;Will Lapse of the Assault Weapons Ban Lead to More Columbines?&quot;. The American Partisan. October 29, 2004</strong> <a href="http://www.american-partisan.com/cols/2004/alexander/qtr4/1029.htm">http://www.american-partisan.com/cols/2004/alexander/qtr4/1029.htm</a> - &quot;The weapons used in the 1999 Columbine shooting included a Hi-Point Carbine and a TEC-DC9 assault pistol, both bought illegally by Columbine killers Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, who were not old enough to legally buy the weapons. If the killers had been old enough, they could have bought both guns legally; the ban would not have stopped them. The Hi-Point Carbine wasn&rsquo;t even in existence at the time of the 1994 ban. Its use during crimes has progressively increased from when it was first manufactured in 1996, to 505 times in 2000. The Hi-Point Carbine shot standad 9mm rounds; it was much less powerful than major caliber pistols and revolvers. Older models of the TEC-DC9 were still circulating after the ban, but its manufacturers had gone out of business by the time of the Columbine shooting. After it was banned, its manufacturer revised it slightly and renamed it the AB-10 (&ldquo;After Ban&rdquo;). Its usage during crimes also increased during the ban, from 8 times during 1995 when it first appeared to 746 times in 2000.</p>
<p>The two Columbine killers had two other weapons, sawed-off shotguns, which have been illegal for purchase or manufacture since the National Firearms Act of 1934, and homemade bombs. None of these would have been affected by the Assault Weapons ban since they were already illegal.&quot;</p>

                    <p>As New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg argues &quot;We&#39;ve got to really question whether military-style weapons with big magazines belong on the streets of America in this day and age.&rdquo;<a href="/print/45255#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Police chiefs such as Ralph Godbee of Detroit argue &quot;We&#39;re talking about weapons that are made for war&hellip; you can shoot 50 to 60 rounds within a minute.&rdquo;<a href="/print/45255#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> In a self defense scenario the person defending themselves need to have enough ammunition to provide deterrence, however they would have to be unwise to take on several assailants so there should be little need to have more than 10 rounds in the magazine. Law enforcement expert Leonard J. Supenski has testified &ldquo;because of potential harm to others in the household, passersby, and bystanders, too much firepower is a hazard&rdquo; as in self defense, the defenders will often fire until they have expended all the bullets in their magazine.

<p>Even those who are against an assault weapons ban such as David Kopel concede that for the most part these are not useful weapons for hunting. These weapons are &ldquo;intended to wound rather than to kill&rdquo; so would certainly not be useful in taking down a deer. Moreover he also concedes &ldquo;a hunter will carry only a few rounds&rdquo; so the large capacity magazine is also useless for sport.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>

                    <p>The Second Amendment was not designed for only self defense and hunting. The idea that the common man should be reasonably able to protect themselves from tyranny, foreign invasion, and insurrection is a reasonable and just cause. But even if we were to accept that self defense and hunting are the only legitimate reasons for owning a gun then why should the state get to decide what weapons someone should use when hunting or defending themselves? That a gun may not be the best choice for these activities does not mean that it should not be a possible choice.</p>

Assault weapons are exceedingly dangerous if used in self defense, because the bullets many of the weapons fire are designed to pass through humans and will pass through structures, and therefore pose a heightened risk of hitting innocent bystanders. As Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police has explained: &quot;An AK-47 fires a military round. In a conventional home with dry-wall walls, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it went through six of them.&quot; No one would want a bullet fired in self defense to penetrate a home&#39;s walls, where it could strike bystanders in neighboring homes.</p>
<p>High capacity magazines containing more than 10 rounds, which were also banned as part of the Federal Assault Weapons Act, are also not useful for self defense, as law enforcement expert Leonard J. Supenski has testified:</p>
<p>&quot;The typical self-defense scenario in a home does not require more ammunition than is available in a standard 6-shot revolver or 6-10 round semiautomatic pistol. In fact, because of potential harm to others in the household, passersby, and bystanders, too much firepower is a hazard. Indeed, in most self-defense scenarios, the tendency is for defenders to keep firing until all bullets have been expended.&quot;</p>
<p>Assault weapons were designed for military use. They have no legitimate use as self defense weapons.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Assault Weapons Bans: A Solution in Search of a Problem.&quot; Gun Owners of America. August 1994 <a href="http://www.gunowners.org/fs9403.htm">http://www.gunowners.org/fs9403.htm</a> - </strong>&quot;Police Say Large Capacity Guns Better for Self-Defense</p>
<p>January 8, 1990, Col. Supenski testified as an expert witness in a case brought by Marylanders Against Handgun Abuse[...]Supenski stated that his objection to a particular .38 caliber revolver was based upon the need to remove the cylinder to reload the firearm:</p>
<p>&#39;[It is difficult] to rapidly reload this weapon.... You&#39;ve got six shots and that is it. . . . The homeowner always has to contemplate the possibility of reloading, and one of the reasons for that is the law requires you to retreat. Retreat to the point in your home where you no longer can retreat, and then you can stand your ground.</p>
<p>Eighty percent of those [knock and rob entries of occupied homes] involve more than [one] individual. So the possibility of needing to reload rapidly and quickly is always present.&#39;</p>
<p>FIE&#39;s attorney suggested during cross-examination that if reloading was so essential, &#39;the best weapon to have would be an assault rifle with a 30-round magazine.&#39; Not wanting to be on record as justifying the ownership of AK-47&#39;s, Supenski replied that &#39;no, the best weapon to have if you must have a weapon, is a shotgun.&#39;</p>
<p>The man officially in charge of crime prevention in Baltimore County, after discussing how you or I must be prepared to face a gang of hoods bursting into our living rooms at any moment, seems to think that private firearms ownership is an &#39;if you must&#39; option--nice to have but not a necessity.</p>
<p>Baltimore County residents now know that their police administrators believe six shots is too few and 15 shots is too many for civilians to have available to protect their loved ones. But when the police are allowed to choose their own guns, magazine capacity is a big selling point. &#39;More&#39; almost always equals &#39;better.&#39;</p>
<p>...Gun Owners of America Executive Director, Larry Pratt, knows all too well what goes through a citizen&#39;s mind during a time of danger. Pratt often reminds politicians that he learned the importance of individual gun ownership during the 1968 riots in Washington, D.C. As a man with a wife and young family, he had every reason to fear for their safety in a situation well beyond the capabilities of the local police.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Many who are pro guns argue that it would be illegitimate for assault weapons to be banned while the police have them. Police forces, however, are going to be much more likely, and able to give them up when a ban is in place. The police don&rsquo;t want to be involved in an arms race with criminals to have the biggest guns; just look at the British police force where there is little gun crime and few shootings of police officers it is not felt that there is the need to have police armed with more than a taser or even truncheon.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Put simply a ban on assault weapons can help reverse the arms race between police and criminals.</p>
<p>Civil liberties would also be enhanced as law enforcement agencies would not need to devote so many resources into monitoring assault weapons purchases and those who have done the purchasing. Instead they would be able to simply target all assault weapons purchases as needing immediate attention.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>Finally we must remember that this ban enhances the highest liberty at all; life. Today as Justice Breyer says &ldquo;gun possession presents a greater risk of taking innocent lives&rdquo; than not having a gun.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>

<p>It is also unlikely that the police and the FBI would recognise the linkage between fewer guns in the civilian population and reducing the firepower of the police. Similarly the FBI is unlikely to monitor civilians less simply because there is one less reason.

It&#39;s part of the campaign to crack down on the flow of drugs to the United States. This summer, things have changed, and Mexico&#39;s military is inspecting vehicles traveling on the southbound lanes, checking for shipments of weapons.</p>
<p>This reversal is testament to the dangers Mexico faces, bordering the United States, a country unable to secure its own borders, where assault and paramilitary weapons are sold to anyone with ready cash.</p>
<p>&#39;We are concerned about the number of weapons coming into Mexico and Central America illegally from the United States,&#39; Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said last month when he was attending a conference in Cuernavaca, south of Mexico City. &#39;There is more that we can do, and we are looking to do, to try and stem the flow of illegal weapons into Mexico.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Mexican officials are frantic over the escalation of violence -- more than a thousand people have been slain throughout the country in the first six months of this year in drug-related violence as drug cartels establish new leaders to replace the ones who have been arrested and extradited to the United States.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Supreme court rulings have been overturned before. This is an area where the bill of rights is clearly outdated and out of touch; today&rsquo;s militia is clearly the standing army and so this should just be interpreted as only granting members of the army the right to carry arms. The maintenance of &ldquo;the security of a free state&rdquo; clearly is not something that today is done through the citizenry having access to guns, whether assault weapons or not. Moreover it is difficult to see why if there is a right to bear arms that is unconnected with the security of the state these arms should be these particular assault weapons rather than types of weapon that we are not looking to ban. Would a rifle not be as useful in the event of invasion as a semi-automatic? The Bill of Rights was written at the end of the eighteenth century when the weapons were muzzle loading muskets it was not conceived with powerful, accurate, modern weapons that are capable of mass murder without reloading.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Argument One:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Assault Weapons Bans. A Solution in Search of a Problem.&quot; Gun Owners of America. August 1994 <a href="http://www.gunowners.org/fs9403.htm">http://www.gunowners.org/fs9403.htm</a> - </strong>&quot;Military-Type Firearms Are Protected by 2nd Amendment.</p>
<p>Assault weapons legislation not only disarms honest hunters and sportsmen while not further troubling the thug and his already illegal and far more deadly sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun, but it also cuts out the heart of the Second Amendment to our Constitution.</p>
<p>The Second Amendment was enacted not to protect hunters and sportsmen, but to ensure that the government never had a monopoly of force it could use to oppress the citizenry. Events not too long ago in Panama, China and the Soviet Union should remind us once again that when a government has a monopoly on the means of effective defense -- like semi-automatic firearms -- there is no check upon its appetites.</p>
<p>Even in this country, government officials can go too far. Consider a small sampling of abuses that have occurred in this decade alone:</p>
<p>In 1992, government agents murdered a mother and son in the mountains of Idaho. The father, Randy Weaver, and a friend had used a deer rifle even more powerful than a standard military rifle to shoot back at the agents. (Before he was killed, the son had also used a semi-automatic military type rifle to return the agents&#39; fire.) Weaver and his friend killed one agent, although a jury later acquitted both of these men, deeming they had used justifiable force in self-defense. (46)</p>
<p>New York City and Chicago have begun confiscating firearms of law-abiding citizens, report newspapers in each city. In New York City, officials are using registration lists to identify gun owners, while in Chicago, police are making random searches in apartment complexes. (47)</p>
<p>Noted constitutional scholar Stephen Halbrook has documented that &quot;[t]he British attempt to seize or destroy the arms and ammunition at Lexington triggered the revolutionary shot heard around the world.&quot; (48) Some of those arms were among the finest available at the time and helped win America her independence from tyranny. The British could not understand why the colonists wanted to keep their military-style flintlock muskets since the British Army was there to &quot;protect&quot; them. Today, the same question is asked about the paramilitary assault rifles owned by hundreds of thousands of Americans.</p>
<p>The issue has remained fundamentally the same over the years. The Founding Fathers in their wisdom tried to guarantee that no future tyrant, be he domestic or foreign, could impose his will upon a helpless population.</p>
<p>Those who argue that the authors of the Second Amendment did not intend to protect the right of ordinary American citizens to own military-style weapons must contend with the fact that the same Congress which passed the Second Amendment also passed the Militia Act of 1792. This law required every free male between the ages of 18 and 44 to own the same type of rifle that was used by soldiers in the Revolutionary War and to own ammunition as well.&quot;</p>

                    <p>It is incoherent to attempt to ban assault weapons while allowing other weapons to remain on the streets. As professor Jacobs from New York University argues &ldquo;Pistols are dangerous because they are easily carried and concealed; shotguns because they spray metal projectiles over a wide area; certain hunting rifles because they fire large calibre bullets, and certain &quot;sniper rifles&quot; because they are accurate over great distances. Assault rifles are not remarkable by any of these criteria.&rdquo;<a href="/print/45255#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Indeed the previous ban simply used a list of guns that were banned rather than a specific definition that could then be applied universally showing the difficulty of classifying these weapons.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> It should also be remembered that this will not affect assault weapons that are already legal in the United States so this would not even be banning all assault weapons so would leave millions in private hands, while it might be argued there is some slight difference between an assault weapon and another gun there is certainly no difference betweena a new and an old assault weapon.</p>

                    <p>The point of an assault weapons ban is not to completely ban guns but to ban guns that can fire large numbers of bullets rapidly and have no purpose other than to shoot people. The ban targets those weapons that are not useful for self defence or hunting. The opposition argument is essentially that because some guns are legal all guns should be legal; the line has to be drawn somewhere and there is little reason why the line at assault weapons is less logical than a line that allows some grenade launchers and shotguns while banning others?<a href="/print/45255#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Since this line is clearly arbitrary then we should move to the only non-arbitrary line, a full ban, a move towards which this ban is a step towards.</p>

In fact, they already have. On California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s desk lies a bill to ban .50 caliber rifles, a target rifle fancied by well-to-do hobbyists. Gun controllers have ginned up a myth of .50-caliber rifles as the new weapon of choice for terrorists, just as assault weapons were supposedly preferred by criminals. In fact, there is only one reported case of a .50-caliber rifle ever having been used in a crime in the United States. Golf clubs are more frequently used as crime weapons than .50 caliber rifles&hellip;</p>
<p>Gun crimes committed with &#39;assault weapons&#39; won&#39;t increase. Semiautomatic rifles never did catch on in a big way with career criminals, because they are too difficult to carry concealed. As a National Institute of Justice study noted in July, using a broad definition of the term, assault weapons were used in fewer than eight percent of gun crimes even before the ban. The firearm of choice for armed criminals has always been the high-quality handgun.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Assault Weapons Bans: A Solution in Search of a Problem.&quot; Gun Owners of America. August, 1994 <a href="http://www.gunowners.org/fs9403.htm">http://www.gunowners.org/fs9403.htm</a> - </strong>&quot;Assault Weapons Not the Choice of Criminals. When the gun control side has it pointed out to them that their sweeping &quot;assault weapons&quot; bans will disarm large numbers of voters, they usually come back with a more limited bill which affects a certain number of scary-looking firearms that they claim are the choice of criminals. Actually, police departments nationwide agree that criminals do not prefer these weapons:</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police View: Over 100,000 police officers delivered a message to Congress in 1990 stating that only 2% to 3% of crimes are committed using a so-called &quot;assault weapon.&quot; (16)</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Florida study: In Florida, only 3.5% of the guns recovered by the police were guns that could loosely be defined as &quot;assault weapons.&quot; (17)</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; California study: The California Department of Justice suppressed an official report showing that &quot;assault weapons&quot; comprised only 3.7% of the guns used in crime. (18) While the report was eventually leaked to the media, it received little press coverage.</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia task force: A special task force on assault weapons found that only 2.8 percent of the homicides involved &quot;assault-type weapons&quot; during 1992. (19)</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connecticut: The Department of Public Safety reports that only 1.79% of all confiscated firearms were &quot;assault type weapons.&quot; (20)</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Jersey: The New York Times reported that, &quot;Although New Jersey&#39;s pioneering ban on military-style assault rifles was sold to the state as a crime-fighting measure, its impact on violence in the state . . . has been negligible, both sides agree.&quot; (21) Moreover, New Jersey police statistics show that only .026 of 1 percent of all crimes involve &quot;assault rifles.&quot; (22)</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nationwide: The Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in 1993 that violent criminals only carry or use a &quot;military-type gun&quot; in about one percent of the crimes nationwide. (23)&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Killing Machines: The Case for Banning Assault Weapons, September 2003, <a href="http://www.joebrower.com/RKBA/RKBA_FILES/BAD_GUYS/CSGV-killing_machines-awb_report.pdf">http://www.joebrower.com/RKBA/RKBA_FILES/BAD_GUYS/CSGV-killing_machines-awb_report.pdf</a> - </strong>&quot;Law enforcement agencies regularly recover assault weapons during searches conducted while investigating other crimes. One in five police officers killed in the line of duty during 1998-2001 were slain with assault weapons, which may explain why the International Association of Chiefs of Police supports a federal ban.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Assault Weapons: &ldquo;Mass Produced Mayhem&rdquo;, Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence October 2008 <a href="http://www.bradycenter.org/xshare/pdf/reports/mass-produced-mayhem.pdf">http://www.bradycenter.org/xshare/pdf/reports/mass-produced-mayhem.pdf</a></strong> - Law enforcement has reported that assault weapons are the &ldquo;weapons of choice&rdquo; for drug traffickers, gangs, terrorists, and paramilitary extremist groups.&nbsp; As Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton said: There is a reason that these weapons are so appealing to criminals. They are designed to be easily concealed and kill as many people as possible as&nbsp; quickly&nbsp; as&nbsp; possible.&nbsp; Congress must&nbsp; act&nbsp; and&nbsp; act&nbsp; now&nbsp; to&nbsp; protect&nbsp; the American public and our police officers from these deadly weapons. This is about public safety and law enforcement.</p>

                    <p>It has already been demonstrated that most crime already takes place using other guns or even without firearms at all so it is illogical to think that this ban would make any difference to crime. For a start as the ban would not be retroactive large numbers of assault weapons would remain legally in the United States. It would create a black market in the weapons which would enrich organised crime which would simply mean that those who are intending to use those guns for ill have access to them while those who want them for self defense don&rsquo;t.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> As a response to Obama&rsquo;s reelection some gun owners are already purchasing more guns and bullets, in some cases with the intention of selling them on the black market should a ban come into force.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> It is clear therefore that the ban would do little to reduce the number of assault weapons in the United States and would likely even do little to impact on their availability.</p>

                    <p>Of course a ban will not completely eliminate these weapons but it would reduce the supply and make it much easier for the police to seize the weapons so taking them off the streets. It would also be a step in the right direction in attempting to change public perceptions and amend the American attitude. It is understated just how relaxed American laws are in comparison to the rest of the world, even states such as Switzerland and Israel that are often highlighted by the NRA as being model states that allow gun ownership with few resulting shootings are much more restrictive than the USA.<a href="/print/45255#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>There is no reason to think that a black market is somehow going to result in more of these weapons being available so the fact that it will exist after a ban is not a reason not to go ahead with the ban. It is not ideal that a ban is not retroactive so leaving a large number of such guns in private hands but this number will slowly diminish over time rather than continuing to rise as it would under the status quo.</p>

<p><strong>Deborah Sontag. &quot;Assault weapons ban comes to end: A dud?&quot;. International Herald Tribune. April 25, 2005 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/world/americas/24iht-gun.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/world/americas/24iht-gun.html</a> - </strong>&quot;When the ban took effect in 1994, it exempted more than 1.5 million assault weapons in private hands. Over the next 10 years, at least 1.17 million more assault weapons were produced - legitimately - by manufacturers that availed themselves of loopholes in the law, according to an analysis of firearms production data by the Violence Policy Center.</p>
<p>Throughout the decade-long ban, for instance, the gun manufacturer DPMS/Panther Arms of Minnesota continued selling assault rifles to civilians by the tens of thousands. In compliance with the ban, the firearms manufacturer &quot;sporterized&quot; the military-style weapons, sawing off bayonet lugs, securing stocks so they were not collapsible and adding muzzle brakes. But the changes did not alter the guns&#39; essence; they were still semiautomatic rifles with pistol grips.</p>
<p>After the ban expired in September, DPMS reintroduced its full-featured weapons to the civilian market and enjoyed a slight spike in sales. But that increase was short-lived, and predictably so, said Randy Luth, the company&#39;s owner. &#39;I never thought the sunset of the ban would be that big a deal,&#39; he said.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Counter: </strong></p>
<p><strong>The use of assault weapons is down 17%, according to a 2004 report to the National Institute of Justice</strong> <a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/research/aw_exec2004.pdf">http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/research/aw_exec2004.pdf</a> - &quot;Following implementation of the ban, the share of gun crimes involving AWs declined by 17% to 72% across the localities examined for this study (Baltimore, Miami, Milwaukee, Boston, St. Louis, and Anchorage), based on data covering all or portions of the 1995-2003 post-ban period. This is consistent with patterns found in national data on guns recovered by police and reported to ATF.&quot;</p>
