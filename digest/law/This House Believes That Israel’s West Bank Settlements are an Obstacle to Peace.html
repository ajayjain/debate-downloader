    <h1 class="print-title">This House Believes That Israel’s West Bank Settlements are an Obstacle to Peace</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>While the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has many components, the struggle for land is at its centre, and therefore the legitimacy or lack thereof of Israeli Settlements in the West Bank has become symbolic of the conflict.</p><p>To the Palestinians, the Israeli settlements represent the slow erosion of their national claims occurring in front of their eyes. Even if some smaller settlements are removed in a final Peace Agreement, many Palestinians are sceptical that the larger ones will ever be removed. A number of Israeli politicians share that view, and while the original argument for the creation of settlements in the late 1970s was one of security, many Israeli far-right politicians such as Avigador Lieberman now admit that the goal of further construction is to alter the “facts on the ground.”</p><p>Equally importantly however, the settlement issue is increasingly seen as a measure of the ability and willingness of the United States government to buck Israel publicly. President Obama has been lambasted by Republicans for his stand calling for a halt to settlement construction – President George HW Bush, who actually cancelled a major loan to Israel over the issue faced a rebellion within his own party, and believed that the backlash helped to cost him re-election in 1992.</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>The Settlements, constructed on land that is neither recognizably Israel’s nor which Israel has even claimed to annex are illegal, encroaching on the territory of a future Palestinian state.</p><p>It is absurd for the international community to demand the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, and yet allow Israel to establish its population on that land in settlements that view themselves and are viewed by Israel as Israeli territory.<a href="/print/17831#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Furthermore, their continued expansion is something that each and every Palestinian can see every day. As a result, the continued expansion both:<br>1. Destroys Palestinian confidence in the ability and willingness of the International community to enforce its own promises, especially after repeated American and European promises to stop their construction.</p><p>2.&nbsp; Convinces Palestinian opinion that the negotiating process is an Israeli game to buy time until they have changed the facts on the ground.</p><p>As a consequence of these two factors, the continued expansion of settlements has an impact in driving Palestinians towards violent resistance even beyond the direct impact of the settlement construction by undermining their faith in International Law, and by adding a sense of urgency to their grievances.</p><div><a href="/print/17831#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> MacIntyre, Donald, ‘The Big Question: What are Israeli settlements, and why are they coming under pressure?’, <em>the Independent</em>, 29 May 2009, http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-big-question-what-are-israeli-settlements-and-why-are-they-coming-under-pressure-1692515.html</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The settlements are a sideshow that provide a convenient excuse for the Palestinians and their foreign friends to ignore the real (and difficult to solve) issues such as Jerusalem and what sort of sovereignty a Palestinian state would have.</p><p>For one thing, international law is very unclear on who owns the West Bank. Jordan gave up all claim to it in 1988, but its unclear as to whether their annexation in 1949 was legitimate in the first place.<a href="/print/17831#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Only Pakistan and Great Britain ever legally recognized Jordanian sovereignty over the West Bank. Secondly, the current border of the West Bank are arbitrary, the results of the military conflict of 1948-49 for which they represent the cease-fire line. As a consequence, even if one accepts the principle that there should be a Palestinian state in the West Bank, it does not follow that the final international border should follow the regions border exactly. It might for instance to make sense, as Israelis like Avigador Lieberman have suggested, to trade Arab villages in Israel proper for settlement areas on the West Bank.<a href="/print/17831#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>The Settlement issue mainly serves the purpose of putting Israel in the wrong, so as to distract from the need on the part of the Palestinians to define what sort of state they are willing to accept. The problem is not territory per se, but what happens to that territory and it’s on that issue that previous efforts to reach peace deals have faltered.</p><div><a href="/print/17831#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> ‘Jordan Renounced Claims to West Bank, 1988’, <em>Palestine Facts</em>, <a href="http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1967to1991_jordan_renounce_claims.php" title="http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1967to1991_jordan_renounce_claims.php">http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1967to1991_jordan_renounce_claims.php</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17831#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Carlstrom, Gregg, ‘Lieberman sees common ground with Livni’, <em>Al Jazeera</em>, 25 January 2011, <a href="http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east/2011/01/25/lieberman-sees-common-ground-livni" title="http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east/2011/01/25/lieberman-sees-common-ground-livni">http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east/2011/01/25/lieberman-sees-common-...</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Whether deliberate or not, the settlements are changing the “facts on the ground” by changing the political calculus for future Israeli governments.</p><p>While most Israeli politicians accept the need to abandon some smaller settlements, the vast majority are unlikely to be evacuated. It was politically divisive to the point of breaking the Likud party in two when Ariel Sharon, a man with more credit than anyone else on the Israeli right pulled out of Gaza in 2005, and there were only a little over 7000 Israeli settlers there. By contrast there are now more than 300,000 settlers in the West Bank, and this number is rising fast.<a href="/print/17831#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> There were less than 200,000 in 2000.<a href="/print/17831#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>Of these settlers, many are religious and vote for the Haridam (Orthodox) parties like the National Religious Party .<a href="/print/17831#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Because the party has served in governments of both the Left and the Right in recent years, in practice they and the ultra-nationalist Israel Beitinu tend to hold the balance of power in the Israeli Knesset.</p><p>Therefore every time Israel expands settlements, they are reducing their room to manoeuvre in future Peace Negotiations, and forcing themselves to take a harder stance. This means that Peace will either become less likely (because Israel will set more extreme terms) or that Israel will face more internal divisions in order to offer it. In either case, as the settlements expand</p><div><a href="/print/17831#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Levinson, Chaim, ‘IDF: More than 300, 000 settlers live in West Bank’, <em>Haaretz.com</em>, 27 July 2009, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-more-than-300-000-settlers-live-in-west-bank-1.280778" title="http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-more-than-300-000-settlers-live-in-west-bank-1.280778">http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-more-than-300-000-settlers...</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17831#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Wikipedia, ‘Population statistics for Israeli West Bank settlements’, <em>en.wikipedia.org</em>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_statistics_for_Israeli_West_Bank_settlements">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_statistics_for_Israeli_West_Bank_settlements</a>, accessed 20 January 2012</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17831#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Etkes, Dror, ‘The Ultra-Orthodox Jews in the West Bank’, <em>Peace Now</em>, October 2005, <a href="http://peacenow.org.il/eng/content/ultra-orthodox-jews-west-bank" title="http://peacenow.org.il/eng/content/ultra-orthodox-jews-west-bank">http://peacenow.org.il/eng/content/ultra-orthodox-jews-west-bank</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>First, it is unclear if this is even true. A 2010 poll showed support for dismantling settlements in exchange for Peace at an all-time high in Israel.<a href="/print/17831#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Secondly, even if it is true that settlements complicate the internal Israeli political picture, the impact on the Peace Process is limited to the extent to which one accepts that the West Bank borders are sacrosanct. Beyond that, the difference in political cost between uprooting 180,000 and 300,000 settlers is marginal at best – both are likely impossible concessions for any Israeli government to make except under enormous international pressure in which case the numerical difference is of limited importance.</p><p>Far more important is accepting that the assumption that the West Bank boundaries are sacrosanct has done far more harm than good. It gives neither side room to compromise on the issues of vital importance to them. For Israel, providing defence in depth for Tel Aviv which is only sixteen miles from Jerusalem, for the Palestinians, ensuring that their national home is economically viable.</p><p>Far better would be to use the existent of the settlements to pressure both sides to accept that some portion of the West Bank will remain with Israel in any settlement, while in exchange, some portion of Israel proper approximately equal in size will be transferred to a future Palestinian entity. Once both sides accept this premise, the number of options for an agreement and for compensations on the issues of dispute increase astronomically.</p><p>It is perhaps for this reason that support for this exchange has moved from the fringes to the mainstream of Israel Political thinking with even Tzipi Livni of the Center-Left Kadima now open to it.<a href="/print/17831#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17831#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Richman, Alvin, ‘Israeli Public’s Support for Dismantling Most Settlements Has Risen to a Five-Year High’, <em>World Public Opinion.org</em>, 15 April 2010, <a href="http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brmiddleeastnafricara/659.php" title="http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brmiddleeastnafricara/659.php">http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brmiddleeastnafricara/65...</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17831#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Carlstrom, Gregg, ‘Lieberman sees common ground with Livni’, Al Jazeera, 25 January 2011, <a href="http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east/2011/01/25/lieberman-sees-common-ground-livni" title="http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east/2011/01/25/lieberman-sees-common-ground-livni">http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east/2011/01/25/lieberman-sees-common-...</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>As important as the existence of the settlements themselves is their continued growth. The very fact that Israel has continued to ostensibly negotiate for the independence of a Palestinian state in the West Bank on one hand while rapidly expanding the population and the size of Israeli settlements can be interpreted as a sign of bad faith.</p><p>For one thing, it raises questions of the seriousness with which Israel is attempting to reach an agreement. Even if the programs of Settlement expansion are intended as a temporary policy in lieu of a settlement, the very fact that Israel’s plan B is arguably as popular as peace, and being pursued with far more vigour could lead many Palestinians to conclude that Israel is attempting to run out the clock.</p><p>The consequences of this are inauspicious for the Peace Process. As Palestinian faith in the prospect of peaceful negotiations falters, groups like Hamas are likely to find an increasingly receptive audience for their view that only force will compel Israel to negotiate seriously.
