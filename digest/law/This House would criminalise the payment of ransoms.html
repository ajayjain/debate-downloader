    <div class="print-content"><p>The crime of &quot;kidnap&quot; involves the capture and imprisonment of an individual with a subsequent demand for payment to secure their release. As such, it is a &#39;serious violation of the most elementary right of mankind: the right to a dignified existence&#39;<sup>1</sup> Payment is usually demanded from relatives, but sometimes rich individuals are kidnapped in order to make them provide access to their bank details. Occasionally a ransom is demanded from the victim&#39;s government. Cases of ransom are particularly common in Central and South America, as well as in post-conflict situations such as those in the Middle East. The motive behind ransom is always financial in some respect (hence the difference to hostage-taking) but ideological motives may also affect the desire for money and the nature of the victim. In South America, much of the motivation for kidnapping is to finance hostilities in the region<sup>1</sup>Cases of ransom are rarer in Europe and the US, but are often very high profile when they occur. In recent years pirates operating from lawless Somalia have captured whole ships with their crews, demanding large ransoms before both the vessels and the sailors are released.</p>

                    <p>Criminalising the payment of ransom would result in one of two outcomes for the payee in question. If they refuse to pay, they would be playing Russian roulette with their loved one - possibly resulting in their death. And if they chose to pay, then they would likely fact conviction, perhaps coupled with the loss of a loved one if the deal turns sour. Writ-large, these harms are just as significant for society, and should be avoided as such. In Colombia, where a large campaign led to citizens signing documents prohibiting any ransom being met, the kidnapping rate merely doubled in its aftermath<sup>1</sup>. Families cannot be expected to trust inadequate police forces when they are certain they will get their relatives back if they pay up.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1410316.stm"> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1410316.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1410316.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1410316.stm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span> </a></p>        </div>

                    <p>Victims of ransom demands do have other options besides paying, or risking their loved ones. Police forces are commonly trained in hostage and ransom situations, and may be able to offer advice and support which greatly increases the likelihood of a peaceful resolution. Furthermore, there is no guarantee at all that a payment would result in a release by the kidnappers. They may add additional demands, or raise the price. They may also fear that the prisoner could identify them, and kill them after collecting the payment. Criminalising payment encourages victims to engage with law enforcement services and should thus be supported.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Ransom payments are means to ends, and when utilized by criminal organizations, those ends are similarly criminal. Stop paying ransoms, and the funds for criminal activities will dry up. When the African Union banned the practice in 2009, Algeria argued one of its primary motivations was preventing the likes of Al Qaeda 'using ransoms it receives in neighbouring countries to finance attacks on security forces inside Algeria'<sup>1</sup>. In the Philippines, police officials have called for criminalization due to fears that ransom payments have allowed Abu Sayyef, a militia linked with Al Qaeda, to survive and finance deadly bomb attacks<sup>2</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/04/idUSL4512141"> http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/04/idUSL4512141</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.gmanews.tv/story/105795/RP-cop-wants-paying-ransom-to-Abu-Sayyaf-declared-a-crime"> <a href="http://www.gmanews.tv/story/105795/RP-cop-wants-paying-ransom-to-Abu-Sayyaf-declared-a-crime" title="http://www.gmanews.tv/story/105795/RP-cop-wants-paying-ransom-to-Abu-Sayyaf-declared-a-crime">http://www.gmanews.tv/story/105795/RP-cop-wants-paying-ransom-to-Abu-Say...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span> </a></p>        </div>

                    <p>Even if ransom payments are used to finance other crimes, why are payees therefore responsible for those crimes? The ransom is not paid so that these crimes can be committed, but rather in order to ensure those held captive are returned unharmed. Families and captives themselves should not have to sacrifice their loved ones or themselves in order to prevent some prospective future crime from occurring. It is the responsibility of the police force to do that, victims of kidnappings should be able to use their own money to protect themselves, however selfish their motivations.</p>        </div>

                    <p>In situations where police forces are inadequate, it is even worse to incentivise ransom further by giving kidnappers virtual certainty of payment (as is the status quo in many areas). It is this combination which underlies the epidemic nature of ransom in some parts of the world. At least if payments were criminalised, potential kidnappers would know that a pay-off would be less likely, and thus some would decide it was not worth the risk. This would allow police forces to concentrate resources on the remaining cases where kidnappers are more determined.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Kidnappers would not be deterred for police forces would be in no position to concentrate resources once ransom payments are criminalised. If this law is to be anything other than dead-letter, they would have to take rigorous steps to monitor and investigate victims of ransom demands to ensure they did not make payments. This would be a highly damaging distraction in a situation where the full focus and resources of the police are needed elsewhere. Further, the knowledge that they would be under scrutiny would likely deter many victims of ransom demands from contacting the police in the first place. This may make sometimes situations even more dangerous for victims of ransom.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Ransom payments should be criminalized and payees arrested if they are found to have paid a ransom. The police should retain a monopoly on all negotiations, both to ensure kidnappings are not materially rewarded and to improve their own efforts to stop the practice. While not all kidnappings may end peacefully, if the police are aware of them all, it may only take a few leads in a few cases to break a kidnapping ring and reduce the threat to society as a whole. Furthermore, the involvement of police will drag out hostage negotiations, making the overall industry less profitable to kidnappers for whom time is money. The African Union in 2009 adopted such a resolution, 'condemning the payment of ransoms to terrorist groups to secure the freedom of hostages'<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/04/idUSL4512141"> http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/04/idUSL4512141</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>The criminalization of ransom payments both leaves the payee in a no-win situation and overestimates the effect of such a policy on kidnappers. Firstly, the very first demand of kidnappers is that the ransom payee does not contact the police, often at risk of the life of the kidnap victim. Once more, it seems cruel to demand that individuals take this significant risk. Secondly, ransom cases often occur precisely because there is a low chance of detection, or due to the untrustworthiness of local police and security forces. It may be preferable for ransom victims to contact the police, but this is best achieved not by coercion, but by making the police a genuine and trustworthy asset in such cases. In Colombia, which has experienced a decline in kidnapping figures from its heights in the mid-2000s, the success is attributed to a proactive policy using the military, rather than a reliance on a reactive police force<sup>1</sup>. The belief that criminalizing ransom payments will have any positive effect is myopic at best.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.ikvpaxchristi.nl/files/Documenten/LA Colombia/English Colombia/Eng brochure_Opmaak 1.pdf">http://www.ikvpaxchristi.nl/files/Documenten/LA Colombia/English Colombia/Eng brochure_Opmaak 1.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Bluntly, the payment of ransom is exactly what the criminal in question wants. It aids them financially, and brings a swift conclusion to a risky situation. Both of these factors greatly decrease the chances of their detection and capture. Given the threat posed by such serious criminals it is more than reasonable for the state to prohibit an action such as ransom payment, which so greatly rewards criminal behaviour. The potential rewards of kidnapping has also led to the practice spreading across borders. In 1999, 92% of all kidnappings took place in just ten countries; by 2007, the practice had spread to six more countries<sup>1</sup>. So long as ransoms continue to be paid, the practice will not stop spreading.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.ikvpaxchristi.nl/files/Documenten/LA Colombia/English Colombia/Eng brochure_Opmaak 1.pdf">http://www.ikvpaxchristi.nl/files/Documenten/LA Colombia/English Colombia/Eng brochure_Opmaak 1.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Ransom payments do reward criminal behaviour but they are the lesser evil. Paying a ransom ensures both that the captives are released without harm and prevents the criminals from committing a more serious crime. Furthermore, the criminal behaviour is not the 'fault' of the ransom payee, therefore the payee cannot be blamed either for the kidnapping or any later crimes. Police remain responsible for preventing crimes occurring in the first place, regardless of the resources of the criminals. The spread of kidnapping as a practice therefore reflect the quality of the police forces in those countries, and cannot be blamed on ransom payees.</p>        </div>

                    <p>A just law cannot demand behaviour from citizens which is supererogatory or unreasonable. We must take individuals as they are in these situations - vulnerable emotional and frightened, rather than as abstracted and depersonalised rational agents. As such the idea of demanding that an individual jeopardise the life of a loved one in the name of some weak societal good seems repugnant. In the wake of an order signed by United States President Barack Obama in 2010 which made ransom payments by U.S. ship owners illegal, the International Chamber of Shipping argued it was 'unhelpful' and that 'the U.S. does not appreciate the potentially life-threatening impact of the order on the lives of those being held captive'<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://neptunemaritimesecurity.posterous.com/obama-piracy-order-unhelpful-ship-owner-group"> <a href="http://neptunemaritimesecurity.posterous.com/obama-piracy-order-unhelpful-ship-owner-group" title="http://neptunemaritimesecurity.posterous.com/obama-piracy-order-unhelpful-ship-owner-group">http://neptunemaritimesecurity.posterous.com/obama-piracy-order-unhelpfu...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span> </a></p>        </div>

                    <p>One can maintain a great deal of sympathy for the plight of the ransom payee, whilst still expecting them to adhere to some basic societal standards. For example, we may sympathise with the victims of violence, or the families of murder victims - but we rightly place great constraints on what they can individually do to re-dress these personal harms. One of those societal standards is the expectation that one should not fund, even indirectly, criminal activities though ransom payments.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The payment of ransom has very real and serious practical harms for society. In addition to aiding the non-detection of such criminals, the payment greatly increases their ability to conduct such acts in future. As many cases of ransom take place within networks of organised crime - the funding from these payments can greatly increase the capability for further acts of ransom (and other crimes) in the future. In states like Mexico, where up to forty per cent of the national population feel unsafe due to profligate kidnapping, more has to be done to discourage or capture kidnappers<sup>1</sup> This provides solid ground for criminalising acts which propagate such activity. Society is not merely harmed by fears for one's own safety, financial fears still exist over the extent of the Somalian piracy epidemic. Despite more than $80 million being paid to pirates in 2008 alone, ransom prices continue to rise<sup>2</sup><sup>,3</sup>&nbsp;.With ships and cargoes continually willing to pay, the costs may eventually be passed onto consumers.</p><p><a href="http://www.ikvpaxchristi.nl/files/Documenten/LA Colombia/English Colombia/Eng brochure_Opmaak 1.pdf">1.&nbsp;http://www.ikvpaxchristi.nl/files/Documenten/LA Colombia/English Colombia/Eng brochure_Opmaak 1.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p><p>2.&nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8061535.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8061535.stm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p><p>3.&nbsp;Harper, 2009</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Kidnappings would not cease if ransoms stopped being paid. Kidnappings are also carried out as a means of stoking fears within a population; in which case, the murder of a kidnapped victim will achieve that purpose just as easily. Furthermore, the harm to society is arguably less if all ransoms were paid and victims returned. If the proposition's model were to be adopted, the number of victims killed would rise and citizens would be far more worried about the risk of kidnapping as a result.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The payment of ransom may also be exactly what the payee wants too. It avoids the potential for violent confrontation, as well as the trauma of a protracted siege or negotiated situation. They may also reasonably imagine that keeping on the good side of the captor will increase the safety of the kidnap victim. Paul and Rachel Chandler, a British couple on a round-the-world sailing trip when captured, were released after 388 days when a ransom was paid by their friends and family<sup>1</sup>. Despite the length of time in captivity, the dedication of their family to raise the ransom ensured their captors treated them well. Given that they too are a victim of a serious crime, it hardly seems just to prosecute them and their family for attempting to peacefully extricate themselves from the situation.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/piracy/8133613/Paul-and-Rachel-Chandler-decision-to-pay-ransom-will-put-other-pleasure-sailors-at-risk.html"> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/piracy/8133613/Paul-and-Rachel-Chandler-decision-to-pay-ransom-will-put-other-pleasure-sailors-at-risk.html" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/piracy/8133613/Paul-and-Rachel-Chandler-decision-to-pay-ransom-will-put-other-pleasure-sailors-at-risk.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/piracy/8133613/Paul-and-Rachel...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span> </a></p>        </div>

                    <p>Ransom payments are effective in specific cases, but what is in the interest of individual captives are not necessarily in the best interests of society. And society must come first. Whilst ransom payments may lead to a greater percentage of kidnappings ending peacefully, the criminalization of ransom payments will lead to a lower absolute number of kidnappings. That makes society safer and criminals and their organizations poorer. The cost in terms of lives to society as a whole must be considered. The ransom money will be used by the kidnappers to finance more attacks with better equipment. Unfortunately that life saved may directly lead to another, or many more, lost.</p>        </div>
