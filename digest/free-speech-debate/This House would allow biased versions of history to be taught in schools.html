    <div class="print-content"><h3>The case: The Japanese New History Textbook controversy</h3><p>A textbook entitled New History Textbook (Atarashii Rekishi Kyokasho) was published by a committee consisting of conservative scholars in 2000, and was approved as a social science textbook for junior high schools by the ministry of education in 2001. This caused controversy and heated debates both domestically and internationally especially in relation to neighbouring countries, such as China and Korea, affecting Japanese diplomatic relations with them. Official approval of the textbook was seen as controversial, as it underplayed Japan’s war-time aggression during the Sino-Japanese war and the second world war. In practice however, the New History Textbook was adopted by only a few schools in Japan.</p><p><a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/case/japanese-new-history-textbook-controversy/">Ayako Komine and Naoko Hosokawa’s opinion</a></p><p>In our Japanese junior high school textbook in the 1990s comfort women did exist and Japanese imperialism was an act of aggression. What is presented by the textbook is far removed from our understanding of Japan’s national history but others can contest its veracity much better than we can here.</p><p>Instead we want to think about how politics is always implicated in the writing or, in this particular instance, rewriting and not writing of the past. It is not a trivial fact that the publication of the textbook was preceded by a period of instability, during which the long-incumbent Liberal Democratic Party lost control over some of its right-wing members. At the same time, the textbook was adopted by a very small minority of local school boards, not least, because a large enough number of concerned citizens spoke out against its use. In that sense, a plurality of voices as well as the means to express those voices were present in Japan, as they should be in a country with institutions that enable free speech.</p><p>In response to this heated controversy, in 2002, Japan, China and South Korea formed a joint research committee on the content of history textbooks. This committee was expected to be a forum for the three countries to exchange their views on history and the textbook. Controversy abated thereafter. The committee continues its activities today and it has published several reference books of history drawn from discussions among experts and incorporating views from each country. However, there are inherent obstacles in accurately reflecting voices from abroad in texts produced as a part of a school curriculum that is one of the sites for the diffusion of national historical narratives, all the more so when these conflict with the narratives of their neighbours.</p><p>Ultimately this controversy begs a fundamental question that goes to the heart of the nature of liberal democracy and the nation-state. Should a state be accountable to the voices of people beyond its national borders?</p><p>- Ayako Komine and Naoko Hosokawa</p><p><strong><a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/casestudies/">Read other case studies similar to the Japanese New History Textbook controversy on Free Speech Debate</a></strong></p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-editors">

                    <p>The Japanese government is not forcing schools to teach Japanese history in a way that whitewashes the Japanese record in World War II. In Japan the Ministry of Education screens textbooks and when they are approved makes them available. Schools are then allowed to select their textbook from a list of seven or eight textbooks that have been approved both by the ministry.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> By making this choice schools are exercising their freedom of speech in deciding what should be taught in their classrooms. In the case of the New History Textbook (Atarashii Rekishi Kyokasho) not a single state run junior high school adopted the textbook resulting in a mere 0.03% of junior high school students using the textbook.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This shows that when the Japanese people are given freedom of information on the issue they exercise this right responsibly.</p>

                    <p>This is not and never can be a freedom of speech issue. In this case it is a teacher or school board deciding what others are to be taught so by its very nature even if that individual has freedom of speech the students do not. In a school freedom of speech is limited; students cannot say what they want when they want, and the same is true with freedom of information; they cannot learn what they want when they want. This is because school is to give them a basic grounding in everything they need to know rather than it being a place where the student can pick and choose.</p>

                    <p>To state the obvious there is an immense amount of history. There is much more history than could ever be taught in school. This means there needs to be some way to cut down everything in history into a sensible sized syllabus. There are some obvious ways to cut down history to a manageable length; such as concentrating on the history of the nation, focusing on certain key events, focusing on things of particular importance to today, or sometimes just on things that are considered fun and interesting. In the UK there have been accusations, including by the current education secretary Michael Gove, that British history is neglected in favour of Nazi Germany and the American west &ndash; something that then avoids Britain&rsquo;s less than comfortable imperial past.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>It should therefore come as no surprise that Japan does not highlight World War II and in particular the bad parts of that conflict. Does China teach about its invasion of Tibet?</p>

                    <p>Yes history has to be edited as it could not all be taught but that does not mean that these are the bits that should be edited out. Rather as other nations consider these parts of Japanese history important it is all the more important for Japanese students to study them so as to learn why South Korea and China react in this way.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>History is not about learning all history, it is not about learning particular bits of history, it is not even necessarily about learning a nations&rsquo; story, rather it is about encouraging students to think critically. It has been regularly shown that stuffing children with facts turns them off a subject instead there should be interaction, discussion, analysing texts from the time and analysing bias.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>The space in the textbook devoted to the issues is very limited and therefore what they mention does not matter particularly much. What matters therefore is how the teachers teach the issues as they will have to supplement the textbooks with other works and there is a wide range to choose from.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> What matters then is how the teachers expand on the issues within the textbook rather than the textbook itself &ndash; the textbook could even be useful at studying the subject by providing a source to study bias on WWII.</p>

As Benedict Anderson argues nations are &lsquo;imagined communities&rsquo; as members of that nation will never know most of the members of that community or even hear about them but despite this there is conceived to be a comradeship between its members.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The creation of a national story from the history of the nation that helps create that common unit. French historian Ernest Renan went so far as to argue that &lsquo;Getting its history wrong is part of being a nation&rsquo;.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>South Korean President Lee Myung-bak himself has argued &ldquo;A textbook of modern history should be written in a way that does not hurt our national pride,&rdquo; when criticising a South Korean textbook&rsquo;s interpretation of the dividing of Korea.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> If this is the case it is difficult to see how there can be any objection to Japan using the same principle.</p>

                    <p>Quite simply if a school in Japan is going to teach about World War II then it should include the darker side of the Japanese involvement in the conflict. Japans acts such as the Nanjing bombing and the occupation of Asian countries were horrific and must not be glossed over. Not covering such actions is quite simply misrepresenting the facts through omission.</p>
<p>No one would consider teaching about Nazi Germany without mentioning the horrors it committed.&nbsp; Learning about, for example the road to war may be interesting, and potentially be useful in drawing lessons on how to prevent a war. Appeasement is still regularly used as an analogy in international relations discussion as meeting almost any aggression with negotiations is seen as appeasing the enemy with Munich as the analogy<a href="/print/42480#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> for example in negotiations with North Korea.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> It is however a pointless exercise if the person learning knows nothing of what happened in the resulting war. Why should they want to draw on the lessons of the failure of appeasement if they do not know about the millions killed and the suffering inflicted?</p>

                    <p>This dispute is obviously not just about teaching &lsquo;facts&rsquo;. China which complains about the misrepresentation of the Nanjing massacre does not teach about the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>The Japanese have no intention of offending South Korea or China with their textbooks and these countries should not be taking offense over such minor issues. While it is regrettable that a tiny minority of students may get a biased view of history from the New History Textbook the actual harm is miniscule. No individuals are directly insulted by a sin of omission, and no one comes to physical harm. Even those who were victims of the Japanese would probably be better off attempting to get formal apologies for the actual crime rather than attacking misrepresentations that will be seen by so few.</p>
<p>For the most part this is an issue whipped up by the two governments who wish to use Japan&rsquo;s WWII past to try and force concessions today and to direct nationalist ire away from the government. In China according the Edward Friedman, an expert on Chinese nationalism, &ldquo;anti-Japan nationalism became a great legitimating glue to hold the society together&rdquo;.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>History lessons in school are not just about providing children with some sanitised version of national history. Instead they are about teaching points that are controversial or relevant to the modern world. Both of which is the case with the issue of comfort women and Japanese imperialist aggression. They must teach why these actions were wrong and why they are now controversial.</p>
<p>If a non-controversial history is taught which glosses over bad actions this may lead to real political results. In Japan there have regularly been suggestions that the constitution should be changed, and in particular that Article 9, the provision that renounces war should be amended or abolished.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> If the Japanese are not taught about the actions that lead to this provision or are given a distorted view of it then the resulting change in perception would make altering the constitution much more likely.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Ultimately this may well be a case of those who ignore [or misrepresent] history are bound to repeat it.</p>

                    <p>No one worries that Britain is going to attempt to recreate its empire because most school children are not taught about it; why should this be any different with Japan?

                    <p>For millions of people around the world Britain is known for its Empire. In Britain itself this is sometimes given a positive spin, as indeed it was by the Victorian empire builders themselves, as opening up the world, bringing education, technology, and eventually democracy. Of course this did happen but those outside Britain are more likely to remember the British empire for its atrocities, for example the invention of concentration camps in the Boer wars; its destroying native cultures such as Australia&rsquo;s aborigines; or its ruthless forcing of trade on others like in the aftermath of the Opium Wars. Denying one side of this history denies us the possibility of understanding what others think of us.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It is often touted that there should be a partnership between India and Britain on the basis of history.<a href="/print/42480#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> But Britain remembers the &lsquo;good&rsquo; Empire did while India remembers the &lsquo;bad&rsquo;.</p>

There is no need to go into every case where a country has done wrong throughout its history. While the use of comfort women was wrong and tragic there is no reason why this should be used as an example of the suffering caused by Japanese imperialism.

    <p>The answer has to be yes it could make for an interesting critical thinking exercise!</p>
<p>More seriously I agree witht he point that &#39;all history is edited&#39; frankly it is going to be biased one way or another. If people are being taught something that is factually untrue then there may be a problem with it but if it is just presenting the same information in a different light I dont think there should be too much objection. Since we are talking about secondary school students the focus should really be on the students being critical rather than learning particular facts anyway.</p>

    <p>Bias can be either covert, or overt in History, it cannot be eliminated. Thus better that it is overt and therefore easy to deal with!</p>

    <p>Overt with a focus on critical thinking would be best; the teacher teaches the history for half the lesson and then in the second part the students disect what the teacher taught them to work out how factual it is - with the avaliability of the internet this might actually be possible, although it would only ever happen with more senior students.</p>
