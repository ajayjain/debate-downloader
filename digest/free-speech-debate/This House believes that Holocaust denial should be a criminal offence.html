    <div class="print-content"><p>The Holocaust is considered one of the most heinous acts in human history and is accepted as one of the largest “crimes against humanity” ever witnessed in contemporary human history. The Holocaust refers to the extermination policies carried out by the Nazi government of Germany (1933-45). This was a deliberate policy of extermination of certain groups, including Jews, people of Jewish ancestry, the Roma (eastern European travelling people), Communists, homosexual people and the mentally handicapped<a href="/print/17768#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Over six million people were estimated to have been executed by the Nazis in the holocaust<a href="/print/17768#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Holocaust denial is the rejection of important facts about the holocaust or the holocaust as a whole<a href="/print/17768#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. Holocaust deniers assert that the Holocaust is a Jewish conspiracy manufactured by the allied forces in order to extract restitution from Germany and/or to justify the creation of the state of Israel. Many deniers believe that if they disprove one fact about the holocaust, they can therefore discredit the entire occurrence of the Holocaust as a whole<a href="/print/17768#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>.</p><p>Holocaust denial is a criminal offence in seventeen countries and in recent years has been proposed in European Parliament by Germany to become a criminal offence all across the EU<a href="/print/17768#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17768#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005143">"Introduction to the Holocaust." <em>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</em>.

                    <p>Holocaust denial is extremely offensive to Holocaust victims and members of the persecuted groups. It is highly distressing for these people and removes a feeling of safety that everybody deserves. Due to the severity of the Holocaust, the proposition that it did not occur is an assault on a very fundamental part of one’s identity.</p><p>The Holocaust is a very large part of Jewish identity. The suffering and persecution of the Jewish people during this time has played a large role in how Jewish people perceive themselves and how they as a community have interacted and existed in the world. When one denies the holocaust, you are denying a very large part of what it means to be Jewish and how the Jewish community has come to understand itself through its interactions with the rest of the world. This not only removes feelings of safety and protection, as will be discussed shortly, but is also, more simply, a direct attack on the Jewish community by outright rejecting their very identity as baseless and illegitimate.</p><p>It is not only offensive but it removes the feeling of safety afforded to groups who suffered during the Holocaust by allowing people to openly reject the occurrence of one of the worst historical experiences of their ancestry. An entire societal acceptance of the occurrence of the Holocaust and its devastating impact on the world is necessary to allow minority groups to feel as though they are protected from it ever happening again. &nbsp;This is especially important when you consider how short a time ago the Holocaust took place. People alive today had grandparents and great uncles who died in the Holocaust and relatives who recall the stories. It is immediately relevant to people alive today and this makes it all the more likely that people fear a repeat.</p><p>Therefore, Holocaust denial removes the right from descendants of those persecuted in the Holocaust to feel safe and free. Moreover, the Holocaust is often emblematic of the very worst human behaviour and is evoked to illustrate why such behaviour can never be allowed to occur again. Seeking to deny the Holocaust undermines that powerful message.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Nobody holds the right to “not be offended.” Everyone has the right to complete free speech unless it directly harms another person. Making someone “uncomfortable” in no way justifies removing someone’s ability to exercise their free speech.</p><p>Those that the proposition believes would feel threatened by the expression of Holocaust denial would actually find more safety in its expression. The societal backlash and opposition to such viewpoints gives vocal support and a sense of community belonging and protection to those “targeted” by Holocaust denial.</p><p>Although this is not what the right of free speech entails in a democratic society, the process detailed above is a facet of human behaviour which secures communities from the worst effects of outrageous or horrific forms of expression. Moreover, free speech also allows for free discussion and deconstruction of pernicious ideas. BY preventing Holocaust deniers from “going underground” a liberal attitude to public free expression forces them to engage with the arguments put forward by scholars and communities who acknowledge the holocaust.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Holocaust denial encourages further anti- Semitism. Those who deny the Holocaust are anti-Semitic, usually regarding it as a myth spread by Jews to justify the creation of Israel. This creates the idea of a “Jewish conspiracy” which entrenches suspicion, hatred and discrimination towards Jews. &nbsp;The more available such opinions are in public, the more people will engage with them and those who would otherwise keep quiet about their fermenting prejudices feel they are part of a larger group which gives them confidence to air their racist opinions. So, Holocaust denial can be seen as a hate-crime, since its aim is to perpetuate racial myths.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The overwhelming public consensus is that the Holocaust did indeed occur. It seems very unlikely that most individuals are going to be persuaded by poor or fabricated evidence that this is not the case. Indeed, by bringing Holocaust denial into the open and being able to directly challenge its beliefs we are able to dissuade people from being convinced by its falsities by being able to actively engage with the denial community. Communities which are underground are much harder to directly engage with, and find it easier to foster a sense of conspiracy that makes their views more plausible to potential recruits. Finally, openness makes it easier to monitor such groups and punish them if they do indeed begin to engage in directly illegal and harmful activities, such as political subversion or racial motivated assaults.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

This is not the case: there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the Holocaust did not happen. If reputable historians debate with Holocaust deniers, it implies that the claims of Holocaust deniers have sufficient merit to be considered on the same level as interpretations based upon a fair reading of historical evidence. Welcoming them into the debate grants legitimacy to this very offensive, distressing and damaging viewpoint, which is offensive and damaging to descendants of Holocaust victims and persecuted groups and is more likely to attract more public support.</p><p>Holocaust denial can therefore only be addressed through the criminal law.</p>        </div>

It is dangerous to argue that the matter should not be debated: Holocaust deniers will say that this is an admission that academic argument is not strong enough to defeat their beliefs.</p><p>It would not be damaging for persecuted communities if Holocaust deniers debated with academics. What would be damaging, however, is if someone argued that there were a legitimate argument in favour of the Holocaust. This could justifiably be called a hate crime.

This means that denial of Holocaust can quickly dominate the popular discourse, giving it more credence and a veneer of being correct by the sheer presence of it.</p><p>Therefore Holocaust denial must be criminalized to stop impressionable members from being indoctrinated due to the asymmetrical nature of where the debate over Holocaust denial will happen.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is true that it would be highly dangerous if Holocaust deniers gained public support. This does not mean it should be banned. Rather, it means that the State has a responsibility to ensure that the public are exposed to the arguments that show that Holocaust deniers are wrong. This is best done through compulsory History teaching about the Holocaust in schools.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The rights to freedom of speech and freedom of academic enquiry should only be infringed when absolutely necessary. The proposition’s “harms” are not sufficient to justify criminalizing Holocaust denial. First, if it can be proved that a person who denies the Holocaust is encouraging hatred of Jews, they should be tried under laws against inciting racial/religious hatred, which exist in many countries already: there is no need for a separate offence of Holocaust denial. If it cannot be proved that a person who denies the Holocaust is encouraging hatred of Jews, it is wrong to punish him/her for doing so. People have no right to be protected from distressing views if they do not create explicit harm; such a right would mean that many kinds of speech had to be banned, in case someone found them distressing. That would have a significant chilling effect on public discourse and would not be something which would benefit society.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is important to maintain the discourse that is created by free speech. The only way one can dissuade people who hold incorrect or bigoted opinions about the Holocaust and to stop them from convincing more people to their side is to openly tackle each of their views in a public and academic way. Free speech allows the fullest and most accurate understanding of the Holocaust and discredits counter-factual conspiracy theories that target vulnerable populations.</p><p>German law takes an approach that punishes holocaust deniers for disseminating false information. Ideas affiliated with holocaust denial- such as radical right-wing beliefs- are not directly punished, but the lie contained in a denial of the holocaust is. On this basis, holocaust denial punished as an instance of malicious falsehood – an act equivalent to creating a stampede by shouting “fire!” in a crowded theatre.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is impossible to deal with Holocaust deniers through reasoned intellectual debate, as the opposition suggest. Holocaust deniers are not interested in historical enquiry and reasoned evaluation of evidence. They distort, ignore and invent evidence to reach the conclusions they want (i.e. that the Holocaust did not happen). Proper historians seek to consider evidence to reach conclusions, rather than working in reverse. Holocaust deniers refuse to be persuaded by debate. Debate therefore does not stop Holocaust deniers spouting their dangerous myths: it is necessary to use criminal penalties to stop them from doing so.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Conspiracy theories are only strengthened if it appears that the justice system is being used to stop people expressing their views. Neo-Nazi groups will say that the criminalization of Holocaust denial is part of an ongoing conspiracy to hide what they wrongly believe to be the truth. Those who are punished under the law will be regarded as heroes. It is better that they be defeated in debate and thereby relegated to obscurity.</p><p>By playing into their narrative and pushing them underground, you do not remove their beliefs about the Holocaust, in fact you make them more dangerous. By playing into their narrative, you give real evidence that they can use as examples of the conspiracy to solidify their other claims, therefore gaining more public support for their views. Moreover, by pushing them underground, they radicalize their views as they are left unchallenged. When not expressed in a public forum, and therefore rebutted in a public forum, these views are expressed in whispers in closed circles and exist without any credible counter-view or opposition. This leads to increased membership to these bigoted viewpoints and more radicalization of views.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

The role of the state is not to persuade the irrational, but rather to protect the vulnerable and impressionable, which we do by stopping these offensive and devastating views from being shared in public.</p>        </div>
