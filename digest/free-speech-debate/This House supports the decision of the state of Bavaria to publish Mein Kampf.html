    <h1 class="print-title">This House supports the decision of the state of Bavaria to publish Mein Kampf</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><h3>The case Hitler's Mein Kampf as Satire</h3><p>In his show The Legacy of a Mass Murderer, the German comedian&nbsp;<a href="http://www.somuncu.de/">Serdar Somuncu</a>&nbsp;recites excerpts from Adolf Hitler’s book Mein Kampf to highlight the absurdity of Hitler’s propaganda. From 1991 until 2001, Somuncu’s show toured through Germany, Austria and Switzerland, where the sale and purchase of Mein Kampf is prohibited. In more than&nbsp;<a href="http://www.taz.de/%2183493/">1,428 readings</a>, Somuncu claims to have reached a total audience of 250,000 people, many of them pupils at German schools, and calls himself “the only person who is allowed to read from this book”. He was repeatedly forced to wear a bullet-proof vest and request police protection because of threats from neo-Nazi groups opposed to his show. In German cities such as Schwerin and Ingolstadt, local government officials from various political parties tried to prevent Somuncu from performing, arguing that reading from Mein Kampf violated common decency.</p><p>The finance ministry of the state of Bavaria is the official owner of Mein Kampf until the copyright on the book&nbsp;<a href="http://www.welt.de/fernsehen/article106253384/Mein-Kampf-ist-ein-sehr-kabarettistisches-Buch.html">expires</a>&nbsp;on 1 Jan 2016. Until then, the sale and purchase of the book is prohibited in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. However, it is not illegal to own the book. Online versions of Mein Kampf are available for free in many languages. There has been some&nbsp;<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-historian-discusses-new-scholarly-edition-of-hitler-s-mein-kampf-a-834560.html">debate</a>&nbsp;over whether Mein Kampf should be available to buy from 2016 onwards. Some – including Somuncu – argue that banning the book would create an aura of mystery around it, whereas anyone who tried to read it would immediately discover that it was “rubbish” and contained one of the “most confused and pointless theories in history”. Others argue that the book should be banned to protect the memory of the victims of the Third Reich and/or because it remains dangerous propaganda and a symbol of Nazism. The president of the Bavarian Teachers Association even argues that Mein Kampf should not be discussed in high school history classes at all, to avoid getting pupils interested in the book.</p><h3><a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/case/hitlers-mein-kampf-as-satire/">Sebastian Huempfer’s opinion</a></h3><p>I don’t think the show (or the book) should be banned. I watched&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfeCNh2eI58">this YouTube video</a>&nbsp;of one of Somuncu’s performances before writing this case study. Somuncu does not simply read from Mein Kampf. Nor does he use politically incorrect jokes to get a few cheap laughs from ignorant audiences. Somuncu’s show is education by satire. It benefits society because it forces people to confront a crucial historical document and reflect on what this document means today. And he is quite funny too.</p><p>Having said this, I can understand that someone who has suffered because of the kind of hatred and bigotry that Mein Kampf espouses would not want to be confronted with any excerpts from the text, and might find the laughter of other people tasteless and even hurtful. It really is problematic when people laugh about the absurdity of racist and anti-Semitic propaganda and conveniently forget that both racism and anti-Semitism still exist in their own society as they do in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.</p><p>On balance, however, I think that the benefits of this kind of intelligent&nbsp;comedy outweigh its harmful side-effects. Its contribution to public debate and historical memory as well as the more abstract good of free artistic expression, in this case at least, outweigh the offence that may be caused by the show. This is especially true because everyone can freely choose whether they want to attend Somuncu’s shows or not.</p><p><strong>Sebastian Huempfer</strong></p><p><u>Debaters’ Note</u></p><p>Since this piece was written, the issue has moved on slightly. Bavaria has announced that the state will publish the book itself in 2015. They will publish a version complete with a critical commentary, which will, in the words of the state’s finance minister, “Make it clear what nonsense is in there.” The full story of their decision can be found <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17837325">here</a>. The issue of publication does not particularly change the principal arguments, which remain whether the book is more dangerous as an available text or as a hidden icon.</p><p><strong><a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/case/hitlers-mein-kampf-as-satire/">Read about Hitler’s Mein Kampf as satire on Free Speech Debate</a></strong></p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>The content of the book is not grounds for supressing its publication or use and so, all other things being equal, there should be a presumption in favour of publication. There is an entirely understandable interest in the publication of the book in a country where it is so notorious. It&rsquo;s important to bear in mind that this is not a bomb making manual and most experts feel that the arguments are weak to the point of absurdity<a href="/print/42206#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> &ndash; and the commentary will serve to enforce that point. The content of the book, in and of itself, were not therefore grounds for continued suppression of the text.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it seems a relatively sensible rule of thumb that if there is no direct harm that can be shown as a result of publication and there is sufficient interest to merit doing so then it would normally be published<a href="/print/42206#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>. By doing so ahead of the end of the copyright, the state will prevent commercial publishers making a profit and this should dampen down the impact of its arrival.</p>
<p>It is standard to take such a presumption in favour of publication in many other circumstances, even where some groups may find doing so offensive &ndash; the Satanic Verses being a case in point.<a href="/print/42206#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a></p>
<p>There is no doubt that the book also has an iconic significance but that might also be said of Das Kapital and, more explicitly, the works of Lenin and Mao but they remain in print for both scholarly and popular consumption.</p>
<p>It seems sensible to treat Mein Kampf as just another book. If this were a recently discovered autobiography by another significant historical figure, it would almost certainly be published - even if it wasn&rsquo;t very good.</p>

                    <p>There is no such thing as a &lsquo;presumption in favour of publication&rsquo;. Publishers don&rsquo;t publish books all the time &ndash; and absolutely nobody cries free speech. Proposition have said it themselves, the arguments aren&rsquo;t persuasive. However, having it published at all would have given the work a degree of credibility it doesn&rsquo;t deserve, having it published with the authority of the state will redouble that. Many of the neo-Nazis who see it as iconic would, in all probability, never have got as far as actually reading the book &ndash; let alone any commentary &ndash; but they will see a book written by Hitler from the print of the state of Bavaria.</p>

                    <p>Extreme parties frequently thrive when they are able to present themselves as being suppressed by a supposed elite. Their ability to portray themselves as being unfairly silenced by a capricious elite has long been used to attract support by parties on the far-right in Europe and elsewhere. For example the far right National Democratic Party went to court to get its newsletter delivered by the postal service.<a href="/print/42206#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> Indeed, given the weakness of many of the arguments they make, silencing them has frequently been far more self-defeating than opening up their beliefs to scrutiny<a href="/print/42206#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>.</p>
<p>As long as Mein Kampf remained unavailable it acquired the inevitable allure of the unattainable. The book could be presented as having a status far beyond what it is &ndash; the ill thought-out and self-indulgent ramblings of a bad writer.</p>
<p>At the moment the book is not, per se, banned, it&rsquo;s just that the owners of the copyright haven&rsquo;t allowed publication until now. As a result, come 2016, there would have needed to be an intervention in the normal flow of events to prevent its subsequent publication; Munich&rsquo;s Institute for Contemporary History had already said it would publish the book.<a href="/print/42206#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a> This would have given the impression that mainstream German society was in some way afraid of the book or its contents and given credence to the suggestions of extremists that there is no effective response to their arguments. By publishing the book in this manner, the state removes both the allure of the hidden icon for devotees and any commercial interest for other publishers. Added to which, those prepared to plough through it (even Mussolini said that it was boring) will at least be rewarded with historical insights from leading scholars.</p>

                    <p>It seems unlikely that it will become any less iconic after publication. Indeed the very fact that it has been published is likely to be hailed as a great victory. Neo-Nazis in Germany and elsewhere will not present this as the result of the elapse of copyright and a measured response by the state. As in any comparable situation, it will be presented as a victory. To take one example, when fascist leaders are interviewed on television or invited to speak in university debates, those actions are presented to their followers as proof of how seriously they are now being taken by the mainstream. None of those followers will be aware that their leader was roundly thrashed, because they didn&rsquo;t watch the interview and didn&rsquo;t attend the debate. Similarly the book will be waved, unopened at rallies to demonstrate to the faithful that progress is being made.</p>

                    <p>If there were not already easy access to the book through the Internet<a href="/print/42206#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>, then it might be possible to argue that there was some practical purpose to be served by continuing its suppression. However, when any disaffected teenager can gain easy access to the text while sitting alone in their bedroom, it seems foolish that it cannot also be examined in the cooler light of their history class.</p>
<p>The issue is not access to the text; it&rsquo;s not even really about ownership of the book &ndash; both of which are already possible &ndash; but rather about how the book is treated. Not publishing or using the book up until now has simply maintained a situation that was put in place after WWII, which in some ways served a purpose, of saying there was no particular reason for a change at any particular time during that process. However, as the seventieth anniversary of the end of the war comes into view, it seems reasonable that the book should be treated as exactly what it is; an interesting historical artefact, to be examined as one might any other.</p>

                    <p>Presenting Mein Kampf as a text for critical discussion gives the impression, at least, that those who supported its arguments and those who decried them were somehow on an equal footing. Having the massed ranks of German academia comment on it is likely to add to its credibility rather than detracting from it as it will suggest that the ideas are worthy of analysis. Treating the text in such a way would be akin to teaching theories of a flat earth in Geography. No child is likely to get through their school career without some discussion of WWII, proposition has failed to demonstrate what, exactly, this would add to that situation.</p>

                    <p>One of the principle reasons for the production of this text was that &ldquo;Once anyone is free to publish Hitler&rsquo;s work, now-Nazis will inevitably churn out editions favourable to the Nazi leader.&rdquo;<a href="/print/42206#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p>
<p>This decision to publish does absolutely nothing to change that &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo; fact. The state of Bavaria has done nothing to restrict other publications but have simply produced an &lsquo;authorized version&rsquo; which does nothing more but give credibility to others. This will still leave the possibility of &ldquo;charlatans and neo-Nazis appropriating this infamous book for themselves&rdquo;.<a href="/print/42206#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> It will allow a narrative to emerge on which is the better publication &ndash; should it be interpreted as we see it today or should it be understood within the setting of Hitler&rsquo;s own time; is it possible to approach the text itself without sharing the perspective of those original readers in the twenties, and so on.</p>
<p>Presumably the Bavarian state has taken this approach because it does not want to be accused of stifling debate on this subject. Which is odd because it&rsquo;s been doing so for nearly seventy years. The compromise of having the official versions and allowing alternatives is, perhaps, the worst possible outcome, allowing the neo-fascist versions the veneer of respectability of being &lsquo;alternatives&rsquo; rather than simply being flat-out wrong.</p>

                    <p>If the publication of other versions is &lsquo;inevitable&rsquo; then it makes sense for those versions to be framed within the narrative set by a version grounded in scholarship and critical discourse. Indeed the very process of allowing people to understand that different versions of the same text can fulfill radically different roles is welcome development in its own right. It is also likely that by the time copyright runs out, people&rsquo;s curiosity will have been largely sated by the official version.</p>

                    <p>If Mein Kampf were presented by a contemporary writer to a contemporary publisher, nobody would go near it; simply because nobody would buy it. There is virtually no market for books of its kind, of which it is a poor example, and even those who might be interested in what it has to say tend not to be known for their book buying enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The overwhelming reason why this would be bought is either out of morbid curiosity or the desire, on the part of neo-Nazis to own an icon. Even one of the editors of the version to be published, Edith Raim, has said &quot;Our book won&#39;t find any buyers in the Neo-Nazi scene. It&#39;s going to be a solid scientific work&quot;.<a href="/print/42206#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> No doubt both will happen. Selling the book will result in profits from both groups &ndash; particularly the latter for whom possession of the physical thing itself is likely to be more important. Those sales will result in profits and it seems distasteful that any profit should be made &ndash; either by the state of Bavaria or subsequent publishers of other versions. This wouldn&rsquo;t be published on the basis of the book itself, the only thing that is driving those profits is the historical role of Hitler, his notoriety and his atrocities.</p>

                    <p>The point is that it isn&rsquo;t being presented to a contemporary publisher by a contemporary author. As with all texts, it is of its time and forms its own part of the historical record. It&rsquo;s entirely likely that if The Canterbury Tales were presented by a contemporary author, publishers wouldn&rsquo;t be fighting over it.

                    <p>Publication of the book provides another symbol for European neo-Nazis who present a very real threat. The Swastika and Nazi salute remain banned in Germany and other jurisdictions; this should be added to that list.<a href="/print/42206#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p>
<p>If Mein Kampf were one of a kind, there might be an argument in favour of treating it in the manner suggested by Proposition. However, the reality is that it isn&rsquo;t. All sorts of Nazi imagery remain banned and not just in Germany and not just because others find them offensive. They are banned because they serve as rallying points for some of the most dangerous elements in society who, in turn, pose a very real and immediate threat to the physical well-being of groups ranging from immigrant to Jews to homosexuals.</p>
<p>The real issue of consistency, if the Swastika is banned, then why not add Mein Kampf to the list? At the time of the prohibition of these other images, there was no need to do so as it was unavailable as a result of copyright. It is not unreasonable to suppose that, had that not been the case, it would have been banned at the time. All additional legislation would do now is to rectify an historical oversight.</p>

                    <p>All of which goes to show how ridiculous bans are in practice as a political tool. When neo-Nazis arrive at rallies with an assortment of black geometric shapes on a white background surrounded by red, nobody stands around trying to figure out what the reference might be. In the same way banning publication of the book doesn&rsquo;t expunge it from history, everyone still knows it was written, who write it, and broadly what it&rsquo;s about. It is the symbolism behind the icon, rather than the artifact itself, that caries the significance. As a result banning the artifact achieves little.</p>
