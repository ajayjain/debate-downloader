First, we both get rid of the narrative that says that being gay is uncommon and “weird”, which has been one of the ways right-wing parties have been able to prejudice the public against the gay rights movements. Second, due to the public nature and high exposure of these individuals, it pushes the issue directly into the political spotlight, removing the ability of politicians to deny its significance or avoid discussing it as a pressing issue for legislation<a href="/print/17936#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p><p>By doing these two things, we propel the issue of gay rights into the political domain and help to shatter the harmful narratives opposition parties have fabricated to quell the struggle for equal rights.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17936#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Rosendall, Richard.

                    <p>Celebrities are uniquely placed to help break down misunderstanding and prejudice against the gay community.</p><p>One of the biggest obstacles to breaking down prejudice is the fact that people do not associate with the cause and can view it as alien and a problem that “they” have, not one that “we” can understand. Celebrities are uniquely placed to help bridge this gap and foster sympathy and understand about the fight for gay rights because of the relationship they foster with people in society. People feel as though they have an emotional connection and familiarity with the people who are rocketed into their family rooms through their TV every night. This level of familiarity means that when they are outed as gay leads to a breakdown of the idea that gay rights are an issue for “them” as it’s an issue that now directly affects you. Moreover, the emotional connection you feel you have with the characters these people play, means that you personalize their situation more than you would with any other form of gay rights activism.</p><p>Therefore, outing gay celebrities fosters a particular type of sympathy and understanding for the cause that cannot be achieved any other way.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Privacy as a right is one that is constructed for an instrumental purpose. It is only relevant in so far as it does more good than harm. In the case of outing gay celebrities, although there may be a short term harm to that individual, there will be a much larger long-term benefit in normalizing gay lifestyles for all of wider society in general. Therefore, by violating this non-essential right of a small number of individuals now, we guarantee the rights of large groups of people for the future.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The fact that these celebrities opted to not out themselves means that they are the type of person who would be the worst ambassadors for the cause of gay rights.</p><p>Celebrities who have not outed themselves are definitionally uncomfortable discussing gay rights in public, are not comfortable enough with their orientation to be open about it in public and are the ones most likely to be hurt by the scrutiny and judgement of society about their sexual orientation. The impacts of this are damaging both to the celebrity and to society. For the celebrity, their lack of comfort over the issue generally indicates that they are still struggling with the reality of their sexual identity. Catapulting them into the public arena to be ridiculed for it is damaging to their capacity to accept their orientation, but can also lead to suicide, such as when a student, Tyler Clementi, was outed as gay and killed himself the next day out of fear and shame<a href="/print/17936#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p><p>Moreover, this is bad for society because they are unlikely to tout the cause of gay rights, will be used as an example of “even gay people are too embarrassed to be themselves”, and instances of self-injury over these outings will, again, set back the movement.</p><p>Therefore, the outing of these particular individuals is extremely harmful both to them and to the cause itself.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17936#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Pilkington, Ed.

                    <p>These celebrities owe a particular duty to this cause. Being members of the gay community, they owe their support for the movement for gay equality. In not outing themselves, they are complicit in the oppression of the entirety of the gay community. This gives society and the gay community specifically the right to out them.&nbsp;</p>        </div>
