    <h1 class="print-title">This House would legalise the use of cell phones in cars </h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>In little more than a decade, mobile phones have become widespread in developed countries, changing the way people communicate and interact. Concerns over their use have tended to centre upon the effects of radio emissions upon the brain, but more recently mobile phones have been blamed for causing a considerable number of road accidents. As a result, a number of countries are seriously considering a ban on using a mobile phone while driving, following the lead of Eire and the State of New York in the USA.</p>
<p>In the UK the government has already banned the use of handheld mobile phones, but still allows the use of hands free kits. This ban also exists within a few US states as well as in countries such as Australia. As such, the motion before the house can vary based on the initial assumption the person setting the debate makes. For the purposes of this summary it will be assumed that the use of cell phones in cars is legal. It is also important to note that as its implementation across a large number of countries might suggest, this debate is likely to strongly favour the side advocating the ban of cell phones in cars. Generally, the proposition should include both normal and hands free sets.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Cell phone use within cars is consistently linked with an increased chance of an accident. This is because if a driver only has a single hand on the wheel he lacks the ability to control the car properly. Further, with both hands free and normal sets, the driver has their hearing incredibly impaired by the phone call, reducing their ability to react to certain hazards. Dialling the phone itself results in an even worse outcome as it takes the concentration of the driver away more, by forcing them to look at the phone instead of the road. Estimates indicate that such phone use has led to the death of 2,600 drivers annually in the U.S.</p>
<p>Further, having a cell phone in the car and fumbling for it when it rings often causes accidents due to the distraction that it presents, firstly psychologically because of the noise going off, secondly due to the fact that both hands again would not be on the steering wheel to control the car.<a href="/print/18543#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>Firstly, it has been found by some studies that cell phone use does not have a statistically significant impact in the reduction of car wrecks.<a href="/print/18543#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This might be plausible because being able to call ahead to work for example and tell them that you will be late reduces the chance that people will speed on the roads.&nbsp; It also reduces the chance that you will attempt to weave between traffic to increase your speed even where acceleration might not be possible.</p>
<p>Further, given the societal benefits from cell phone use in cars, such as better organisation for the entire population, it seems that a ban on the use of cell phones should not be implemented because the cost of doing so is too great when compared to the benefits allowing phones would confer.<a href="/print/18543#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

Those who assert they know the difference between safe and unsafe use of phones should ask themselves if they are equally confident that the testosterone-loaded 18-year-old rushing from football practice to meet his girlfriend will show the same good judgment when his phone beeps as he approaches in the opposite direction.&quot;</li>

<li>People should not explain in car on phone why they are running late.&nbsp;If one is late, there is little difference in apologizing while in their car over a cell phone and apologizing in front of their boss at the office. So, they should have the restraint to drive at the speed limit, arriving late, and being willing to apologize then; an apologetic cell phone call in a car to a boss shouldn&#39;t be the cause of one being able to then relax, slow-down, and drive the speed-limit&nbsp;</li>

Cato.org. December 29, 2000&nbsp;- &quot;Cell phone subscribership in the United States has grown dramatically in recent years, from 92,000 people in 1985 to more than 77 million in 1999. A recent National Highway Traffic Safety Administration survey reports that 44 percent of drivers have a cell phone with them while driving, a number that will only increase with the proliferation of phone ownership. We calculated that car accidents associated with phone use account for about 300 deaths per year. While small in comparison to the 41,000 annual deaths from car accidents, these deaths raise the question whether cell phone use while driving is justifiable. We think a ban is unwise at this time because vehicular cell phone use provides substantial personal and societal benefits, but does not contribute to a large number of serious accidents.&quot;</li>

                    <p>Cell phones in cars, unlike a variety of other distractions, can be regulated easily. They are an object which can easily be identified, and with phone bills it is possible to find out if a person is lying when they are caught for using cell phones in cars. As such the fact that other distractions exist, even if they are as harmful as cellphones, is no reason to not to ban their use.</p>
<p>Further, other sources of potential distraction, such as passengers or car radios, may provide a net gain in utility to road users and other stakeholders in mass transit systems. Being able to carry multiple people in cars for example helps society through a reduction in carbon emissions as well as simply through a reduction in traffic. To take this argument further, there are many people who cannot drive but require use of cars. For example, children might require their parents to drive them to school. Car radios are somewhat more controversial and principally if they prove to be as bad a distraction as a mobile phone then proposition would have no problem with banning them. However, things such as news and traffic updates are probably more useful to a driver than the use of mobile phones. Whilst they may be distracting, given the huge benefit they cause for society it is legitimate for them to be allowed.</p>
<p>Even if the benefit that they confer is the same as that of phones however, it is legitimate within our mechanism that we would ban them as well if required.<a href="/print/18543#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>Many other things such as radios within cars are just as distracting as mobile phones. Although it is easy for police and prosecutors to prove that a mobile phone was in use during a particular period of time, it is difficult to monitor the use of mobile phones in most situations. Enforcing a ban on mobiles would be as impractical as a ban on arguing with a spouse.</p>
<p>Further, the point of the ban on mobile phones is to minimise distractions. However, a simple ban on mobile phones is likely to create a false sense of security among road users.</p>
<p>Objects similar to cell phones are not subject to bans, despite the fact that they might be distracting as well. For example, a tablet PC in the passenger seat would not be under this ban, but could easily be as distracting. This false sense of security could practically cause drivers to be less conscious of distractions and thus hurt in the long run. Whilst the law might incorporate these bans into the system, the prevalent message that will get to the people will typically be centred on a mobile phone ban. This is because mobile phones are the single most prevalent item that would be banned under the proposition. As such, even though the law covers all distracting goods, it might still breed complacency in people, causing them to ignore other items in the car that might be distracting and assume that they are legitimate.<a href="/print/18543#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>The state places rules upon its citizens for the overall betterment of society. However, whenever possible the state also affords citizens liberty.</p>
<p>This is the case because the state sees that when people are free to do what they want they are able to make better decisions for themselves and further are able to interact with the state better. They do this because they feel that the state is allowing them to make their own decisions and as such the state is showing its trust in its citizens. This bond of trust between the state and the citizens as well as the state giving the citizens their own responsibilities means that citizens respect the state for the fact that it does not limit them.</p>
<p>To examine this from a point of view that does not rely on moral consequentialism and a utility based principle, it is possible to say that the state should afford people liberty and freedom because the starting point of any rational moral calculus should be the admission that an individual is the best judge of what is in his own interest. To not give people choice is ultimately an idea that dehumanises people. As such, the only time where freedoms should truly be restricted is when allowing the freedom results in a greater level of dehumanisation among the people. So for example, we prevent murder because allowing people to kill one another results in allowing some people to entirely remove other people&rsquo;s ability to choose on purpose.</p>

<p>It is important to note that when someone causes a death through ignorant driving they have resulted in the dehumanisation of a person through the removal of their ability to choose.</p>
<p>However, more so, the resulting society where people are free to do what they want ignores the fact that often people lack full information to make their decisions in an informed way. It also fails to understand that as time goes on people often regret decisions that they once made. As such, people are often happy to and do make the choice to give up some of their freedoms and allow the state to make those decisions for them.</p>
<p>Given then that people consent to having the &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; taken away from them, it seems legitimate that the state can make decisions that they might not immediately agree with, under the assumption that the state, as a composite of a large number of different people has a level of oversight that the individual doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The state has the advantage of being able to take a step back and have a broader perspective. Individuals will make decisions that impact them in a positive way but this does not mean that those decisions will not have a negative wider impact on society.</p>

<li><strong>Banning cell phones impedes on individual liberties.</strong>&nbsp;Mobile phones don&rsquo;t kill people, bad driving does, and simply banning the use of phones will penalize the many good drivers without removing the dangerous ones.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Argument:_Markets_are_better_at_regulating_cell_phone_use_in_cars" title=" Markets are better at regulating cell phone use in cars">Markets are better at regulating cell phone use in cars</a></strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4414" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4414">Paul Tetlock, Jason Burnett and Robert Hahn. &quot;Ban Cell Phones In Cars?&quot;. Cato.org. December 29, 2000</a>&nbsp;- &quot;Indeed, it is likely that the market will more effectively address cell phone risks than will government intervention. If the cell phone problem becomes serious enough, car insurance companies can classify drivers who use cell phones in higher-risk groups and charge them commensurately higher premiums. Because an insurance company bears the burden of reimbursing injured parties for their losses, a company may decide to charge drivers who use cell phones higher premiums, to compensate for the increased risk that cell phones force the company to assume.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Counterargument</strong></p>
<p><strong>State has authority to regulate actions of drivers (by cell phone ban).</strong>, for example, through speed limits, rules against drink driving, etc. Dangerous driving meets the classic liberal test by endangering not just the individual but others, including drivers, passengers and pedestrians, and so society has a right to intervene to protect the innocent. A new law signals social unacceptability, and will send a message to drivers; the New York ban has already been highly effective.</p>
