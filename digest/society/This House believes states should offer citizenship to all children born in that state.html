    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes states should offer citizenship to all children born in that state</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>At present all children born in the USA are automatically made citizens of the United States. This applies even if one or both parents are not themselves US citizens &ndash; they could be illegal immigrants, tourists, students, or legal immigrants temporarily working in America. In many other countries birthright citizenship does not exist; babies born in countries such as the UK or Japan do not automatically become citizens as their status depends on the citizenship and immigration status of their parents. As the debate over illegal immigration in the USA has gained strength over the past decade, there have been calls to change the US system by removing birthright citizenship. Similar debates have occurred in other countries, with Ireland voting by referendum to end birthright citizenship in 2005. On the other hand Germany used to restrict citizenship to those of German descent, but changed its laws in 2000 to give citizenship to many children born in Germany to parents who were non-citizen &ldquo;guest-workers&rdquo; (most Turkish in origin).</p>
<p>The debate in the USA is complicated by the origins of birthright citizenship there. The original United States Constitution, written in 1787, assumed the concept of citizenship but did not define it. Courts at state and federal level (notably Lynch v. Clarke in 1844) applied the English common law principle of &ldquo;Jus soli&rdquo; - the idea that you gain citizenship by virtue of your birth in a particular country &ndash; rather than &ldquo;Jus sanguinis&rdquo; (&ldquo;citizenship of blood&rdquo;), the alternative concept that a child acquires the status of their parents. However, major exceptions were made for Native Americans and African-Americans; notoriously, in the 1857 case of Dred Scott vs Sandford the US Supreme Court found that no African-American, whether slave or free, could be a citizen of the United States. This is why after the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, the 14th Amendment to the Constitution was passed in 1866 (ratified 1868). This says that &ldquo;all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&rdquo; Because of the 14th amendment it is usually argued that the only way to remove the right of birthright citizenship would be to amend the US Constitution. Although some Republicans are keen to overturn birthright citizenship, the party is not united on this issue and Democrats are solidly against the proposal, so a constitutional amendment to this effect is very unlikely to pass. However, some advocates of a change argue that the 14th Amendment has been misinterpreted in the past, and that by passing ordinary laws at federal or state level that challenge birthright citizenship, they could force the Supreme Court to look again at the issue.</p>

                    <p>The national security of the state depends on shared values, norms and principles, factors that by definition cannot be tested and massaged whilst immigrants hide in the shadows and refuse to come forward. Birthright citizenship encourages the assimilation of families and cultures as a whole into that of the state, forming not a homogeneity but a comfortable and restrained multiculturalism joined at the core by certain shared principles. As John McCain noted in a 2005 speech, ‘we have a national interest in identifying individuals, incentivizing them to come forward out of the shadows…regularize their status’<sup>1</sup>. Therefore, to ensure that state derives the most it can out of its citizens, it is in their interest to give them citizenship at birth rather than turn a blind eye to the illegal underclass.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/elections/regularization-meaning-7-15-2010">Fox</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span><a href="http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/elections/regularization-meaning-7-15-2010"> 10 News, 2010</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Condoning illegal immigration threatens national security. A path to citizenship legitimizes illegal immigration, increasing the belief that immigrating illegally is OK, thus further jeopardizing borders, straining border enforcement resources, and generally increasing the risk that terrorists or narco-traffickers will be able to pass through the borders undetected.

                    <p>Citizenship should not be just about an accident of birth. It should involve an understanding of our nation's history and principles, and a commitment to these common ideals. For most children born to citizen parents, these are learned in the family home, creating a strong nation of proud patriots. Others choose to become citizens through naturalization, proclaiming as adults their knowledge of and willingness to uphold these principles. But birthright citizenship means that a child born here becomes a citizen, even if their parents have no commitment to our country, speak none of our language, and have a political allegiance to a different state. As Matthew Spalding makes clear, the key to successful immigration lies in a 'deliberate and self-confident policy of patriotic assimilation', forming one nation from many people by ensuring citizens know what they are migrating into<a href="/print/17568#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.

                    <p>Citizenship is not an ideal, it is a legal condition. In the United States, citizenship is transferred upon anyone born in the country. Whether they are illegal immigrants or not is irrelevant. Though illegal immigrants do act in bad faith in entering the country, whether deliberately to provide their children with citizenship or not, their children should not be sentenced for their parents crimes. Furthermore, those children, if denied citizenship, would nevertheless be 'American in every other respect' and have few ties to their parent's home<a href="/print/17568#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. It makes little sense to deny those children citizenship and aid the 'establishment of a permanent class of unauthorized persons', unable to break the cycle of poverty no matter how much English they learnt, hours they worked or American history they imbibed<a href="/print/17568#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17568#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/BirthrightInsight-2010.pdf">Migration Policy Institute.

                    <p>Allowing birthright citizenship encourages illegal immigrants to pour unchecked into our country. Knowing that if they can have a child born in the United States it will automatically have US citizenship gives would-be migrants a strong incentive to make it across the border, even if only for long enough to give birth. As Senator Lindsay Graham described in 2010, "they come here to drop a child – it’s called ‘drop and leave’ – that attracts people here for all the wrong reasons”<a href="/print/17568#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. An “anchor baby” with American citizenship can then be exploited to prevent the authorities deporting the parents, and to gain access to a variety of state benefits. In 1981, the United Kingdom succumbed to ‘political pressure to remedy the perceived problem of increased social service costs due to immigration’, rejecting territorial birthright citizenship<a href="/print/17568#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. In time it means the child can help its parents to gain citizenship themselves. Removing birthright citizenship is therefore essential if we are to check uncontrolled illegal immigration.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17568#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/29/lawmakers-consider-ending-citizenship-children-illegal-immigrants/"> Fox News.

                    <p>There is little evidence that the rights of "anchor babies" drive illegal immigration into the USA. Rather, migrants are seeking a new life, with better opportunities for themselves in America, just as millions of other new Americans have done for centuries. Most are seeking to join family members already resident in the USA. 80% of immigrant new mothers in 2008-9 had already been in America for at least three years, which hardly suggests a rush to give birth as soon as they cross the border<a href="/print/17568#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. And "anchor babies" cannot help their parents gain American citizenship until they are at least 21, so the incentives suggested by the opposition simply don't exist<a href="/print/17568#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.

                    <p>Birthright citizenship prevents an increase in the number of illegal residents. As more children of current illegal aliens are denied citizenship, we will be creating a permanent, 'marginalized and undereducated' underclass with few civil rights, likely to be alienated from our society but knowing no other homeland to which they could return<a href="/print/17568#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. A recent Migration Policy Institute study found that the removal of birthright citizenship would lead to a 44% increase in the illegal immigrant community<a href="/print/17568#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. More illegal immigrants creates a hereditary poverty due to the understandable barriers to entry in the job market for non-citizens. Further to that, Jared Bernstein, a senior economist, argues that illegal immigrants are statistically poorer because they lack access to the economic advantages conferred by citizenship; 'while 9.8% of those naturalized are poor, the share for non-citizens is a whopping 21.6%'<a href="/print/17568#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. To increase the amount of illegal immigrants with such statistics in mind would only serve to exacerbate the poverty of such groups and provide a sore for the state as a whole.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17568#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/upfront/debate/index.asp?article=d0403">Jacoby, T.

                    <p>The underclass of illegal aliens will remain so long as the incentive of the birthright citizenship exists. It operates as an amnesty in all bar name, providing a backdoor entry into the country for those who are unable or unwilling to enter into the long and often tortuous citizenship process. A Heritage Foundation report reveals that 70% of the women who gave birth in a Dallas hospital were illegal immigrants in the first quarter of 2006<a href="/print/17568#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Such blatant circumvention is indeed encouraged by birthright citizenship, which places no requirement on the child or its parents to assimilate or demonstrate their allegiance to their new state. Therefore, rather than avoiding the creation of an underclass of illegal aliens, it both props this population up by encouraging their migration whilst adding citizens to the population for whom there is no guarantee they will abide by the dictates of the state.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17568#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a><a href="http://blog.heritage.org/?p=40567"> Carafano, J.

                    <p>Birthright citizenship has been a critical driver of integration for generations. For newly arrived immigrants, knowing that their children will have full citizenship has encouraged them to work hard, put down roots and invest in their new country. For their citizen children, knowing they have equal opportunities with all other young Americans has led them to work hard to achieve their dreams. As Tamar Jacoby of the Manhattan Institute argues, 'newcomers put down roots and invest all-out in their lives because they know their children will be guaranteed full membership'<a href="/print/17568#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. If birthright citizenship is removed, the process of integration will inevitably stutter.

                    <p>Migrant integration is driven by the involvement and engagement of new citizens with the civic process, not a birthright citizenship law that encourages immigrants to hide their identities until they have given birth. For legal immigrants to the United States, in contrast, the naturalization process is a long and difficult one, not to be undertaken lightly. The idea of birthright citizenship undermines this system, making a mockery of the aspirations of those law-abiding migrants who are made to wait in line before they can obtain responsibly what others can achieve simply through an illegal entry and subsequent birth. To uphold the legitimacy and significance of the citizenship process, one would have to remove the automatic birthright rule and restore faith in the formal immigration system.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Citizenship should aim to encourage the forming of ties between state and migrant, not encourage the splitting of allegiances between multiple states. Birthright citizenship legitimizes illegal immigration, increasing the belief that immigrating illegally is OK, thus further jeopardizing borders, straining border enforcement resources, and generally increasing the risk that terrorists or narco-traffickers will be able to pass through the borders undetected. Birthright citizenship, therefore, constitutes a threat to national security through its appeasement towards migrants who have entered illegally. Furthermore, as John Fonte describes in relation to the United States, 'dual citizenship violates the principle of equality of citizenship. It means that some citizens (dual citizens) are, in effect, supra-citizens, because they have voting power in more than one state and are loyal to more than one constitution'<a href="/print/17568#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.

                    <p>Patriotism and loyalty is far likelier between a citizen and their state than between the state and an unauthorized person. Furthermore, birthright citizens can be tracked by the authorities in a manner which unauthorized persons are not; therefore if they wanted to act against the state, they would far easily be located than if they had not been given citizenship at birth. Similarly, the denial of birthright citizens would not lead to a general decrease in anti-government sentiment. A Migration Policy Institute in 2010 found, using population projections, that the continuation of the birthright citizenship law would maintain the illegal population constant at 11 million (Migration Policy Institute, 2010). Any change to the rule would lead to a gross rise in the illegal population<a href="/print/17568#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.

                    <p>Removing birthright citizenship will involve costly unintended consequences. A huge new federal bureaucracy will be needed to keep track of millions of residents who lack citizenship, but who cannot be deported because they have no citizenship elsewhere either. As Tamar Jacoby points out 'these young people know no other home, many will never learn the language of their parents, and very few will even consider going back to the Old Country'<a href="/print/17568#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. It will be, as legal expert Margaret Stick notes, 'a bureaucratic nightmare' requiring the hiring of 'thousands of lawyers to adjudicate people's applications and figure out whether they are citizens or not'<a href="/print/17568#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Furthermore, it may have wider effects in society. In the United States for example, 'the vast majority of people prove their citizenship through a birth certificate, and if that is no longer considered proof that you are an American citizen, they are going to have to come up with something else'<a href="/print/17568#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>.

                    <p>The repeal of birthright citizenship and its replacement with a fair, just process is, bureaucratically, offset by the reduced border presence required to track down and repatriate growing numbers of illegal immigrants.

The onus is on the government to ensure that their country's immigration policy ensures that future generations will contribute favourably to both society and the economy.

The United States is famously a nation of immigrants, welcoming "huddled masses yearning to breathe free" on the Statue of Liberty. Unlike Germany or Japan, where ethnicity has traditionally been the criteria for citizenship, the USA is a melting-pot, uniting people of diverse origins under one flag. Throughout US history the children of non-citizens have been accepted as true Americans, paying taxes, being drafted and fighting for the flag in wartime, and being elected to office. As enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States'<a href="/print/17568#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.

                    <p>Citizenship should be accessible only to those who are deserving; the lottery of birth does not qualify. Many migrants wait decades to prove their worth to their potential home, and yet have to watch as illegal immigrants hop over the border to have their child. For many countries with citizenship quotas, this only pushes the migrants further back in the queue, disadvantaging those taking the legal route. Regarding the 14th Amendment in the case of the United States, Senator Stuart Pearce responds 'illegal wasn't illegal then (in the wake of the Civil War)…it’s illegal to enter the United States, illegal to remain here but you get the greatest inducement you could possibly have…it was never intended to do that’<sup>1</sup>.
