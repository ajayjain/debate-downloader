    <h1 class="print-title">This House Believes Socialism is Dead</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Tactical note: One of the difficulties with any debate relating to ideology is that, to put it mildly, they raise definitional problems. Capitalism is relatively easy although certainly Smith would be unlikely to recognise the actions of the red in tooth and claw Capitalists of modern banking. However, that is beside the point. Socialism is even more difficult to define as it tends to be used in both positive and pejorative terms. The added difficulty is that there is a world of difference between the steady social justice of Scandinavia and the ramblings of the regime in North Korea and yet both lay claim to the word.</p><p>As a result it is all too easy for this debate to degenerate in to Prop rambling on about 1989 and Op extolling the virtues of paternity leave in Sweden. Neither approach gets very far. Socialism is ultimately about economics, social justice and the distribution of wealth.</p><p>The death of Socialism has been declared in many ways and usually by people who don’t understand what it means. However there is little doubt that the global Left looks very different now from how it appeared in a pre-Reagan/Thatcher era, or for that matter pre-Clinton. Certainly in the Anglo-Saxon world Clinton and Blair shifted massively on the issue of using taxation as a method of redistribution of wealth, and that is a trend that appears to be continuing under their successors.</p><p>Writers and intellectuals have spent much of the last two decades either bemoaning or relishing the demise of the organised left although they tend to overlook certain things. Primarily, if one were to sit down with Morris or Orwell and describe the world in 2012-especially the West-they would be staggered at the progress that had been made in terms of promoting the rights of the individual against those of a capitalist elite. Many of these battles were won directly because of the actions of Socialists and others as a result of a changing dialectic they inspired. Since those results remain – universal suffrage, the abolition of child labour, the establishment of socialised medicine and universal education, in Europe at least – does that mean that socialism is alive and well?</p><p>Alternatively, one can argue that for the most part the Socialist parties of Europe have hung up their red flags, gone back to their ideological drawing boards and returned with something that looks very much like Market Capitalism but with a few of the sharper edges smoothed off and painted a nicer colour. Increasingly, those who even use the word in European discourse tend to look either desperately out of date or terribly, terribly isolated.</p><p>Realistically this debate is not focussed anywhere near America, where (whatever Newt Gingrich may think) Socialism never even got started. It is also hard to set in Asia where entirely different political traditions produced a range of comparable conclusions – but that confuses things.</p><p>The “Occupy” protests that came to prominence in 2011 give an interesting perspective on proceedings and raises an interesting question: can any of the protests – be that the Occupy movements or the more sporadic anti-austerity protests, be meaningfully described as socialist?</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>Socialism has frequently been defined by its opponents and as Capitalism has changed so have the political responses made to it. The fact that this iteration of socialism is different should come as no surprise to anyone who has studied the history of Socialism. That earlier generations of Socialists would not have recognised a blog or a Twitter account doesn’t change the fact that they recognise the flaws of Capitalism and reject the widely accepted views of the last twenty years or so that if everything is left to the market then everything will come out just fine.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The world has moved on; it is inconceivable that the protests of the seventies and eighties could be refought again. This issue was settled at the end of the eighties. It wasn’t just the collapse of the Soviet Union, although that no doubt played a major role in shaping the future of socialism in Europe.</p><p>In a globalised world the traditional ideas about class and the nature of the labour market have moved on and politics moved on with it.</p><p>Socialists may have won many of the arguments over social issues, but arguments on the advantages of free trade, deregulation, the role of the state, the relationship between government and industry all line up firmly in the Capitalist column.</p><p>There were some remnants of dogmatic, “classical” socialism left in continental Europe, especially amongst its union movements, which are now collapsing.

                    <p>It seems odd to quote the wife of an investment banker commenting about the abuse of other people’s money. What is becoming increasingly clear in critiques both from the left and the right is that we can actually afford a welfare state just fine but not at the same time as allowing a bunch of Wall Street wideboys to play fast and loose with the nation’s money.</p><p>In terms of twentieth century ideologies, certainly there have been changes on both sides of the political fence – the rise of moralising neo-cons and a growing far right is nothing for Conservatives to write home about – but the idea that Capitalism now reigns supreme rather than having the guts of it corpulent excesses scattered across the capitals of Europe is simply laughable.</p><p>As the high priests of Capital write themselves yet another cheque, an increasing number of people are objecting to the idea that public services should be closed so that the very rich can have their taxes reduced simply won’t wash.</p>        </div>

However, even the most casual wander around the blogosphere makes clear that the principles of market economics are a long way from being universally agreed.</p><p>The intellectual recovery from the assault posed by Thatcherism and Reaganomics has taken time but is certainly taking place and it is increasingly the Right that appears intellectually bankrupt.</p><p>Organisations like the <a href="http://www.neweconomics.org/">New Economics Foundation</a> are approaching old problems in new ways alongside a whole range of popular movements – environmental, youth led, immigrant led and others.

However, the militancy seen over the last few years suggest, if anything, that what was a diversified ‘anti-capitalist’ movement is now coalescing around a rather clearer set of goals of which the basics of the anti-capitalism movement are merely a part. In the light of the globalisation of Capitalism, the left is increasingly rediscovering its internationalist roots which were lost to a great extent in the seventies and eighties in national struggles to save industries and jobs.</p>        </div>

This has nothing to do with the emergence of Socialism for the 21<sup>st</sup> century – however desperately the Socialists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century may wish it.</p><p>The closest even the most ardent supporters of the current protests can get is that ‘things should be different’ other than that it tends to be a round of decidedly nineteenth century solutions to nineteenth century problems.</p>        </div>

                    <p>In the model of Blair and Clinton, it didn’t matter if the rich got a lot richer, as long as the poor got a bit richer. That model has now been shown not to work and the rather timid new leaders of the left are starting to return to concepts of fairness and equality rather than the rather bland concepts of ‘opportunity’ and ‘choice’.</p><p>Europe is increasingly governed by unelected technocrats who seem to think that the opinions of a handful of international bankers are somehow more important than the jobs and livelihoods of millions. This may always have been the case but it tends not to show during times of plenty.

                    <p>It has rarely been so clear that the interests of the few are not the same as those of the vast bulk of either European societies or the world outside it. At a time of rising unemployment, a handful of people who are already fantastically rich continue to pay themselves obscene salaries and bonuses. Of course there is nothing in this that is unusual, it’s just not usually done in so cavalier a fashion.</p><p>Although there&nbsp; is nothing mechanical in the process, most Socialist thinkers have been clear that the popular realisation that there really is a class distinction between what the Occupy protesters refer to as the 1% and the rest of us is an important first step towards establishing Socialism.</p><p>Whatever the media and political classes may pretend, Socialism is not – and never was – a single party or policy.

                    <p>Global economic forces have rendered socialism powerless. Financial speculation, and investment flows can make or break economies, and the agents who channel these monies want to see countries liberalise, privatise and de-regulate more. This is being shown by the speculative attacks on Eurozone countries where the markets are showing they can force governments to implement tough austerity or even force changes in government without an election as has happened in Greece and Italy where technocrats have taken over as Heads of Government.<a href="/print/18050#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>These more flexible markets generate higher levels of growth and prosperity, and provide higher returns on investment, encouraging more. Countries which try to resist globalisation and liberal economic markets, as in ‘old Europe’, suffer stagnant growth and higher unemployment as a result.
