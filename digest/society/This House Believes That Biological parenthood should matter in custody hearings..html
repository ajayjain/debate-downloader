    <h1 class="print-title">This House Believes That Biological parenthood should matter in custody hearings.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Custody hearings are a special type of decision-making forum which take place within the family courts. In a these cases, judges are empowered to make decisions about residence (where the child should live) most often when parents separate or when children are born to parents who are not in a relationship. The hearing must also consider contact (how much time the non-residential parent can spend with the child) despite residence agreement. Judges can order direct contact (either overnight or daytime), supervised contact (at special centres) or indirect contact (by telephone, letter or email). Residential parents who refuse to allow such contact face a range of sanctions including prison in extreme cases. When making decisions, courts take into account all available information about the child and both parents. Biological parenthood generally refers to the mother who gave birth to the child and the parents who are genetically related to the child. This stands in opposition to social parents who care for the child: adoptive parents, stepparents, partners within homosexual couples who have undertaken IVF, etc. The growth of non-traditional families has meant that this definition of parenthood has gained increasing prominence. The term gestational parenthood is used in circumstances in which a child's gestational mother differs from its genetic mother — as happens in egg (or embryo) donation and gestational surrogacy when a different woman carries and gives birth to the child. In this case up to three women have claims to parenthood of the child – the egg donor (the genetic parent), the surrogate (the gestational parent), and the intended mother (the social parent). Such cases and issues appear in courts in the UK and the US as well as across Europe but this discussion will focus on UK law. The debate tackles the issue of how important biological parenthood should be in custody hearings. The proposition argues that biological parenthood is of great importance and should be prioritised over the other constructions of parenthood in the decision-making process of the judge. While the opposition argues for equality between constructions or even priority to those other formulations of parenthood. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

                    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Biological parenthood does matter to a child’s welfare and the court must therefore take this into account: people care about their biological heritage. ‘Every child has the right to a natural biological heritage’.* The desire to understand their biological heritage is evident from the large number of adopted children who register to find their natural parents. There are a number of reasons for this. It can be important for the development of a personal identity to have a sense of one’s heritage, particularly if one’s ancestors originated from a different part of the world with a different culture or set of traditions. People like to see themselves as part of something more important than merely their own existence and having a sense of the history of their ancestors assists this understanding. Given this, it is particularly important for the development of the child’s identity that they have some form of contact with their biological parents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* ‘The rights of Children and The Redefinition of Parenthood’ David Blankenhorn, Presentation at the Danish Institute for Human Rights (2005) <a href="http://www.americanvalues.org/html/danish_institute.htm" title="http://www.americanvalues.org/html/danish_institute.htm">http://www.americanvalues.org/html/danish_institute.htm</a></p>        </div>

Children search for their biological parents because society conditions them to think that these individuals matter to their identity. Ignoring biological parenthood in custody hearings is an important step towards rejecting biological parenthood as superior and achieving the equality of parenthood necessary for the happiness and emotional security of the increasing number of children in non-traditional families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* ‘Donor-Conceived Children in Search of their Biological Histories’, Psychology Today (2011) <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/genetic-crossroads/201103/donor-conceived-children-in-search-their-biological-histories" title="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/genetic-crossroads/201103/donor-conceived-children-in-search-their-biological-histories">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/genetic-crossroads/201103/donor-conc...</a></p>        </div>

It has been established that it may be in a child’s interests to maintain contact with a biological parent, even where all other factors militate against this.* It is unfair on these children to use them as social battering rams.</p><p>Furthermore, the unfairness would be compounded in those states where biological fathers are forced to pay towards the child’s maintenance if the biological link was used in this context but not in establishing contact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* ‘Father Absence and the Welfare of Children’, Network on the Family and the Economy <a href="http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/macarthur/working%20papers/wp-mclanahan2.htm" title="http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/macarthur/working%20papers/wp-mclanahan2.htm">http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/macarthur/working%20papers/wp-mclanahan2.htm</a></p>        </div>

Three types of parenthood have been identified – biological, gestational and social – but if in custody cases equal weight is given to different types of parenthood, it is not a fair reflection of the emphasis society places on biological parenthood.</p><p>* ‘Fathers and Children: the Law’, Dad.info <a href="http://www.dad.info/separation/law-and-rights/fathers-and-children-the-law?show=all;" title="http://www.dad.info/separation/law-and-rights/fathers-and-children-the-law?show=all;">http://www.dad.info/separation/law-and-rights/fathers-and-children-the-l...</a></p>        </div>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Biological parenthood should be a small factor to consider, it is clear that judges tend to give it too much weight. This is clear in the English courts where the House of Lords has recently held that there are three types of parenthood – biological, gestational and social* – and that a lesbian mother with all three aspects of parenthood must have priority over the lesbian co-parent with only one type, irrespective of who is better capable of caring for the child. Allowing courts to take biological parenthood into account can lead to unfair decisions. These decisions are unfair on social parents and harmful to the welfare of the child where his or her interests are not best served. It would consequently be better for it to not be considered at all.</p><p>* ‘Parenthood and Procreation’ Stamford Dictionary of Philosophy (2006) <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parenthood/#GenAcc" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parenthood/#GenAcc">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parenthood/#GenAcc</a></p>        </div>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The court’s priority should be the welfare of the child and biological parenthood is irrelevant here. When making decisions, courts should focus on what is best for the child and his or her future development. Judges should take into account each adult’s capacity to provide care, their relationship with the child, their lifestyle and their motivations. Being biologically related to a child has no value in and of itself. For example, ‘When paternity tests revealed that the child Stephen Quinn had raised as his own was in fact the biological offspring of David Blunkett, Quinn attracted palpable sympathy with his declaration: "I will not draw a distinction between biological and non-biological – we are not buying Persil or Daz."’*</p><p><strong>* </strong>‘Our surrogacy Laws are Putting our Children at Risk’ The Guardian (2011) <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/09/surrogacy-laws-children-at-risk?INTCMP=SRCH" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/09/surrogacy-laws-children-at-risk?INTCMP=SRCH">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/09/surrogacy-laws-child...</a></p>        </div>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other reasons may also move the courts to favour biological parents, however there are some cases, such as a father who is imprisoned for attacking the mother, where all the other factors weigh against any form of contact. It is the fact of biological parenthood alone which may rightly justify ordering indirect or supervised contact. Denying such information to the courts removes this reason for contact in a small number of cases, and so harms the welfare of these children.</p>        </div>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ignoring biological parenthood is crucial for equality of parenthood. As the growth of non-traditional family structures continues, more and more children do not live with both their biological parents but instead with step-parents, co-parents within homosexual couples, etc. It is important for the emotional development of these children and the integrity of their families that all parents are perceived equally. However, in giving weight to the fact of biological parenthood, the courts implicitly send a message that other types of parenthood are inferior.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* ‘Parenthood and Procreation’ Stamford Dictionary of Philosophy (2006) <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parenthood/#GenAcc" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parenthood/#GenAcc">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parenthood/#GenAcc</a></p>        </div>

These parents can play an important role in the child’s upbringing and it is unfair for both the father and child not to consider this biological link.</p><p>* ‘Unmarried Fathers’ Rights’ Families Need Fathers (2010) <a href="http://www.fnf.org.uk/law-and-information/unmarried-fathers" title="http://www.fnf.org.uk/law-and-information/unmarried-fathers">http://www.fnf.org.uk/law-and-information/unmarried-fathers</a></p>        </div>

Similarly, if one considers couples with fertility difficulties who use another man’s sperm during IVF or rely on a surrogate, it is evident that individuals may be unable to achieve biological parenthood through no fault of their own. It is unfair on these parents to disadvantage them on this basis, rather than their commitment to the child.</p><p>* Couple win fight for custody of “stateless” surrogate twins’ The Daily Mail (2008) <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1093922/Couple-win-fight-custody-stateless-surrogate-twins.html" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1093922/Couple-win-fight-custody-stateless-surrogate-twins.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1093922/Couple-win-fight-custody...</a></p>        </div>

Even if courts are denied this information, the problem here is not the information being available but rather judicial attitudes. It would be better to target such attitudes than to ignore a relevant factor and so harm a child’s welfare.*</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* ‘The Tensions Between Legal, Biological and Social Conceptions of Parenthood in English Law��� EJCL (2006) <a href="http://www.ejcl.org/103/art103-14.doc" title="http://www.ejcl.org/103/art103-14.doc">http://www.ejcl.org/103/art103-14.doc</a></p>        </div>
