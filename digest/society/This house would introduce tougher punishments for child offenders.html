    <h1 class="print-title">This house would introduce tougher punishments for child offenders</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Many nations, including the UK and the US, created juvenile justice systems to punish juveniles in more lenient, rehabilitative ways. Therapy is often offered and sentences are shorter. However, both nations have begun to change their systems to focus more on retribution and deterrence, meaning juveniles are now punished harshly. This is because of the rising number of juvenile offenders, which suggest the failure of the current policies. However, an increase also means there is potential for overcrowding in juvenile detention. Is this change just, or undeserved?</p>

                    <p>Juveniles are more easily rehabilitated than adults, and if they are put in facilities meant for rehabilitation their recidivism rate drops drastically. Prisons, particularly adult prisons, are full of social rules and norms that legitimate domination, exploitation and retaliation. These will inevitably be passed on to impressionable youngsters who are locked up. In a study by Donna Bishop "They routinely observed both staff and in-mate models who exhibited these behaviors, and they observed these illegitimate norms being reinforced." Youths in prison area also exposed to an inmate subculture that teaches criminal motivations as well as techniques of committing crime and avoiding detection. Finally, prison staff engaged in negative shaming communicating to the vast majority of offenders was that they are lost causes who cannot redeem themselves<sup>1</sup>. Prison is therefore not the answer as it will simply make juveniles more criminal rather than reforming them.<br><sup>1</sup> Bishop, Donna. "Juvenile Offenders in the Adult Criminal Justice System."

                    <p>Recidivism rates will increase in juvenile facilities because they are not treated like adults. Statistical analysis proves that adult courts rehabilitate better than juvenile criminal courts, "According to the IDOC [Illinois Department of Corrections], 79% of juveniles charged with crimes were not treated as adults. 1,493 juveniles were released in 2008, only 536 returned, but 68% of those juveniles were treated in juvenile courts. 58% of African Americans who were treated in juvenile courts returned, and nearly 71% of all returned because of a different crime"<sup>1</sup>.<br><sup>1</sup> Timothy, Mark.

                    <p>Michael Howard, a former British Home Secretary, famously declared that "prison works" and it is as true for juveniles as for anyone else<sup>1</sup>. The best way to prevent crime in the short run is to lock up the offenders. This prevents them from immediately harming society. In Britain in 2006-7 to 07-8 crime fell by 476,900 offences and between April 2007 and April 2008 the prison population increased by 1,843. If the annual offending rate was 140, then 258,000 crimes would have been prevented. If the additional prisoners were all serious offenders, as the Government claims, then 473,000 crimes would have been prevented<sup>2</sup>. Prison is also the longer term solution as children who have been imprisoned will be deterred from committing crimes in the future when they are free. In the long term deterrence is not the only thing preventing crime, just because a juvenile is in prison does not mean that he will not be rehabilitated at the same time.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/feb/08/uk.ukcrime1">Branigan, Tania, "Howard revives 'prison works' message" The Guardian, 8 February 2005, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4353433.ece"> Green, David, "Prison works.

                    <p>First, as aforementioned, in a study of over 350 people charged with crimes and adjusting for variables such as background and previous crimes, Norman Poythress found: “[The] examination of 16-17-year-old defendants transferred to criminal court by direct file found few differences between them and 18-24-year-old criminal defendants in competence-related abilities and developmental characteristics with potential significance for decision making in the legal process. Where differences existed, they suggested somewhat better performance for the Direct File sample than for the Adult Defendant sample”<a href="/print/17692#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.&nbsp; Second, simply because juveniles are not as able to stand trial does not mean they do not deserve as harsh a punishment – they simply need more help in the court system.&nbsp; This data suggests that we need to make sure juveniles have help in the trial stage to ensure they understand what is occurring, rather than not giving them a strict punishment.</p><div><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17692#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Poythress, Norman, et. al. “The Competence-Related Abilities of Adolescent Defendants in Criminal Court.“ Law and Human Behavior, pp. 75-92</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Juvenile offenders do not have the competence to stand an adult trial. According to The Center for Child and Family Policy<sup>1</sup> "A defendant's competence to stand trial refers to abilities such as understanding the signi?cance and nature of the trial, being able to offer relevant information to counsel, and applying information to one's personal situation in an accurate and rational way." These criteria inform decisions concerning the competence of mentally-challenged individuals in adult courts.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.childandfamilypolicy.duke.edu/pdfs/familyimpact/.2007/BriefingReport_07.pdf ">The Center for Child and Family Policy; "Adolescent O? enders and the Line Between the Juvenile and Criminal Justice Systems"; Duke University (2007) </a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>There are still many juveniles who commit crimes independently, and the question at hand is whether they intrinsically deserve a less harsh punishment. Rather, the court systems include duress as a mitigating factor to solve for this harm, so this argument is already invalid given modern court systems. Moreover, only the actions of a given individual ought be of importance to justice and hence criminal punishment. Even if being around other criminals makes one more likely to commit crimes, that does not justify nor mitigate their culpability when they autonomously choose to break the law.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Juveniles face much external coercion and, unlike adults, are unable to combat it. Scott and Steinberg argue: “[A]dolescents are subject to peer pressure, including pressure to commit crimes, to a far greater extent than adults…[M]ost juvenile crimes are committed in groups, while most adult criminals act alone. In some high-crime neighborhoods, peer pressure to commit crimes is so powerful that only exceptional youths escape…[I]n such settings, resisting this pressure can result in loss of status, ostracism, and even vulnerability to physical assault.” The circumstances many teens face in these social contexts are similar to those involved in adult claims of mitigation due to duress, provocation, necessity, or domination by co-defendants—and appropriately are deemed mitigating of culpability…the case for mitigation on this ground is all the more compelling because, unlike adults, teens as legal minors are not free to leave their schools, homes, and neighborhoods to escape this pressure. Thus, it seems clear that juveniles are less culpable for their crimes.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Degrees of culpability are entirely contingent on degrees of freedom, and reciprocal justice even acknowledges that voluntarism is important. Immanuel Kant argues: “The degree of responsibility depends on the degree of freedom… In imputing responsibility we must consider impediments and conditions. The greater the obstacles to action which we must overcome, the more accountable we are for the action; the less an action results from our freedom, the less responsible we are for it... If for instance, a starving man steals something from the dining-room, the degree of his responsibility is diminished by the fact that it would have required great self-restraint for him not to do it... The more a man is driven to action by external forces, the less is his responsibility”<a href="/print/17692#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. And, juveniles are less responsible for their acts because it is harder for them to control themselves; age ought to be a mitigating factor so they should not receive retributive punishment.</p><div><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17692#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Kant, Immanuel.

                    <p>Reciprocal justice proves that individuals need to be punished in proportion to how they have acted. &nbsp;James Rachels describes reciprocal punishment: “People deserve to be treated in the same way that they have (voluntarily) treated others.&nbsp; Those who have treated others well deserve to be treated well in return, while those who have treated others badly deserve to be treated badly in return”<a href="/print/17692#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><strong><strong>[1]</strong></strong></a><strong>.</strong> If this conception of justice is true, then juveniles need to be treated strictly, as they have violated other people.&nbsp; Margaret Falls explains: “a man's punishment is justified or obligatory because unlike non-offenders he has gained satisfactions attendant on the commission of an offence…[punishment is justified] because otherwise he would be gaining an unfair advantage: he would be profiting from his own selfish refusal to play fair and respect the rights of his fellow citizens…The immediate focus of justification thus centres not on the offender but on the law-abiding citizen”<a href="/print/17692#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17692#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Rachels, James. “Punishment and Desert.” <a href="http://www.jamesrachels.org/punanddes.pdf" title="http://www.jamesrachels.org/punanddes.pdf">http://www.jamesrachels.org/punanddes.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17692#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Falls, Margaret. “Retribution, Reciprocity, and Respect for Persons” Law and Philosophy, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Apr., 1987), pp. 25-51 Published by: Springer Stable URL: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3504678" title="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3504678">http://www.jstor.org/stable/3504678</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>First, recent studies have shown that juveniles are just as developed in important areas. In a study of over 350 people charged with crimes and adjusting for variables such as background and previous crimes, Norman Poythress found: “[The] examination of 16-17-year-old defendants transferred to criminal court by direct file found few differences between them and 18-24-year-old criminal defendants in competence-related abilities and developmental characteristics with potential significance for decision making in the legal process. Where differences existed, they suggested somewhat better performance for the Direct File sample than for the Adult Defendant sample”<a href="/print/17692#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Therefore it is not certain that they are less mentally developed. Even if juveniles are more impulsive that is not sufficient justification for a less harsh punishment because many “Crimes committed impulsively, for example, are still committed consciously and intentionally.&nbsp; Nor do most commentators claim that late adolescent offenders do not know the nature and quality of their acts, do not know their acts are wrong, or act in response to duress.”&nbsp; Simply because they have a harder time stopping themselves from committing crimes doesn’t justify less harsh punishments, so they deserve an equally strict punishment.</p><div><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17692#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Poythress, Norman, et. al. “The Competence-Related Abilities of Adolescent Defendants in Criminal Court.“ Law and Human Behavior, pp. 75-92</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Juveniles are not fully developed mentally, which limits their ability to restrain their actions to solely those that are in accordance with the law, and so ought to be punished less.&nbsp; Krisin Rhodes writes: “‘Adolescents rely more heavily on the amygdala—an evolutionarily older area of the brain associated with 'primitive impulses of aggression, anger and fear-than adults do. This proposition seems logical, since the prefrontal cortex, which interacts with and in effect 'reins in' the amygdala to temper impulsiveness and gut reaction with reasoning, does not fully develop until the early 20s. Thus…adolescents are prone to more impulsive, aggressive behavior, characteristic of the amygdala's primordial function.&nbsp; This biological difference is consistent with the behavioral problems associated with juvenile offenders”<a href="/print/17692#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. This inability to reign in their behaviour merits a less harsh punishment. “[T]he criminal law operates by guiding the conscious actions of persons capable of understanding the rules and rationally applying them, [so] it would be unfair and thus unjustified to punish and to inflict pain intentionally on those who did not act intentionally…People who lack the capacity for rational guidance are not morally responsible and should not be held criminally culpable”<a href="/print/17692#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.</p><div><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17692#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Rhodes, Kristen: “The Criminal Prosecution of Juveniles: A Philosophical Reappraisal of Adolescent Agency”.

                    <p>Simply because something deters does not make it just.&nbsp; James Rachels explains why the focus on deterrence is inappropriate: “[First,] if we are concerned only with deterrence, [there is no reason] to punish only the guilty.&nbsp; As far as deterrence is concerned, what matters is not whether the person punished is guilty, but whether he or she is generally <em>believed</em> to be guilty.&nbsp; If people believe she is guilty, the deterrent effect will be the same as if she really were guilty.&nbsp; Moreover, from this point of view, it would be much better to convict an innocent person (who is generally believed to be guilty) than for the crime to go “unsolved,” because when crimes are unsolved people get the idea that the law is ineffective and the deterrent effect of the law is diminished… [Second,] If we are concerned only to deter crime, we will want to make penalties severe enough that the unlawful behavior really will be discouraged.&nbsp; This is a very different standard than the idea that punishments should “fit the crime.”&nbsp; For example, a penalty that would actually stop people from jaywalking might have to be much more severe than we would think appropriate given the trivial nature of the offense”<a href="/print/17692#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. So, simply proving that a certain punishment will deter does not mean the punishment is morally appropriate – this logic justifies disproportionately harsh responses.&nbsp; Moreover, numerous studies have concluded that stricter punishments do not reduce crime.&nbsp;</p><div><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17692#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Rachels, James. “Punishment and Desert.” <a href="http://www.jamesrachels.org/punanddes.pdf" title="http://www.jamesrachels.org/punanddes.pdf">http://www.jamesrachels.org/punanddes.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

Yoper writes: “a study using experimental methodology that looked at juvenile smoking behavior also confirmed that price will negatively impact their consumption… Even non-consumption risky behavior was found to be responsive to incentives.&nbsp; Teenage pregnancies, for example, fell as welfare benefits fell…but even non-price variables affected risky teenage behavior, as teenage pregnancies declined as the incidence of AIDS grew…the econometric evidence points to the proposition that even youth are rational who respond to incentives in a consistent and measurable manner, thereby suggesting that juveniles can be deterred”<a href="/print/17692#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. &nbsp;</p><div><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17692#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Yahya, Moin A. <em>Deterring Roper's Juveniles: Using a Law and Economics Approach to Show that the Logic of Roper Implies that Juveniles Require the Death Penalty More Than Adults</em>.
