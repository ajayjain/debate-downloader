    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes that political parties are currently failing to engage with young people</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>There is no doubt that, if participation in elections is used as a measure of political engagement, the interest shown by young people<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup> has plummeted in recent elections. However, the picture is a little more complicated than that. Overall turnout has generally been on the decline since 1950 and young people are part of that decline, although it should be noted that they consistently have a showing lower than other age groups. Since 1997, UK turnout has notched up a series of historic lows in Westminster elections, The lowest turnouts in the EU for European elections and derisory turnouts for local elections with a national average below 30 percent of registered electors<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote2sym" name="sdendnote2anc"><sup>ii</sup></a></sup>. Studies into this decline, in relation to young people and other groups have consistently concluded that &ldquo;[falling youth turnout is] not a function of declining interest in politics or elections but rather of the failure of the campaign to connect with the electorate.[Electoral Commission, 2001, p.17]&rdquo;.</p>
<p>2005 was a new low, both generally and for young people<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote3sym" name="sdendnote3anc"><sup>iii</sup></a></sup> in particular. There was a small increase in 2010 but not enough to suggest a reversal of the trend.</p>
<p>There are some other factors that are worth taking into account before drawing any conclusions based on the statistics alone. The first is that there does not appear to be a correlation between the issue of falling turnout and other standard drivers of poor electoral participation. The main correlating factors for poor turnout are financial security and educational achievement. By all of the usual measures, the current generation of young people are healthier, brighter, better educated and richer than their predecessors. Although employment has fallen since 2008 this is the result of a discernible economic event which is quite different from the social-alienation of traditional non-voters. To put it more clearly, those individuals who were most disengaged from voting were, historically, the long-term unemployed. However, unemployment does not cause an antipathy toward the electoral process for the individual, there is, rather, a correlation between the two as both are a hallmark of a lack of wider societal engagement. The same group would also be more likely to smoke and drink heavily, be drug users, have a low standard of education, have difficulty maintaining marital or other relationships and rely on public housing.</p>
<p>The case with young non-voters could not be more different<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote4sym" name="sdendnote4anc"><sup>iv</sup></a></sup>. As a generation they are more socially engaged than their parents, more likely to have a degree, considerably less likely to smoke, drink or take drugs and more likely to have extended social networks and interests (the impact of the Internet has been massively transformative on this last point). By all of those counts, they should be rushing to the polling box. Many commentators have concluded that since a meritorious group could not be to blame, responsibility must lie firmly at the door of the political class and the associated professions such as journalism<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote5sym" name="sdendnote5anc"><sup>v</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, there is another side to the story. All sorts of measures of social participation among young people are changing. They are considerably less likely to attend Church than their parents and grandparents &ndash; although considerably more likely to be a member of a religion other than Christianity<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote6sym" name="sdendnote6anc"><sup>vi</sup></a></sup>. They are considerably less likely to be a member of a trade union than those over the age of thirty (and especially those over the age of fifty)<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote7sym" name="sdendnote7anc"><sup>vii</sup></a></sup>. Although they are more engaged with large social networks, apocryphal evidence, at least, suggests that these may be virtual relationships where political interests are less likely to be held in common than they would be in, for example, the workplace. A breakdown in clear sectorial interests and the growth of &lsquo;mixed-class&rsquo; groups (for example blue collar homeowners or white collar transient workers) has led to a more general disengagement with traditional methods of political association since the 1980s. In the light of this it is possible that when young people complain &lsquo;their&rsquo; issues are not addressed, it would be hard to see how these issues would not include employment, welfare, housing, defence, taxation and civil liberties &ndash; that is to say, everybody else&rsquo;s issues as well. If this is the case then it would suggest that young people are complaining that politics is too political.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one final factor that reflects on this debate. The general voting trend is down across all age ranges &ndash; it&rsquo;s just at its most accentuated among younger people. It would be possible, and quite reasonable, to suggest that it&rsquo;s untrue to say that politicians are failing to connect with young people per se, they&rsquo;re not connecting with anyone else either. Events such as the expenses scandal<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote8sym" name="sdendnote8anc"><sup>viii</sup></a></sup> certainly had an impact across the board and for all that it may seem to be a young persons&rsquo; issue, vitriol responding to the Lib Dem u-turn on tuition fees doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been limited to students. Certainly their showing in Scottish and local elections would seem to suggest a more general malaise.</p>
<p><strong>Debaters&rsquo; Note</strong></p>
<p>Although the third of these points could work as an Op critique of the Prop&rsquo;s likely case, it would be risky as young people would be a sub-category within the wider electorate. They could however use it to suggest that Proposition has misdiagnosed the causes of the problem and therefore the case would be undermined. It would require arguing that the problem is wider and more systemic and that appealing to young voters won&rsquo;t achieve anything as it addresses the wrong issue. However, it is a risky Op to run.</p>
<p><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote1anc" name="sdendnote1sym">i</a> Throughout this debate, the term &lsquo;young people&rsquo; refers, broadly to those under the age of thirty. However, this definition varies slightly between different supporting texts. Most polling data, for example, tends to identify 16/18 &ndash; 24 and 25 &ndash; 34 as the relevant age groups but does not break that down further.</p>

                    <p>As well as a falling representation in elections there has also been a generational shift in party membership. An era of falling party memberships has left British politics as a gerontocracy. In the &ldquo;1990s, 29% of party members in Britain were aged 60 or</p>
<p>over, compared with 24% of voters; by the 2000s, these figures had risen to 56% and</p>
<p>27% respectively<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small part this may be explained by the baby boom generation hitting sixty but overwhelmingly it seems to be a disengagement with young people. In short, life-long party members have stayed and younger people have left in droves.</p>
<p>Even at the most basic level of political participation, being registered to vote, a &ldquo;recent study of voter registration revealed that only 56% of 19-24 year olds were registered to vote, compared with more than nine in every ten (94%) of those aged 65+ (Electoral Commission 2011).&rdquo;<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote2sym" name="sdendnote2anc"><sup>ii</sup></a></sup></p>
<p>By every available metric, young people&rsquo;s involvement in the democratic process has gone through the floor. Ultimately there is only one group that can take responsibility for that collapse in confidence &ndash; the political class.</p>

                    <p>It is in the nature of a democracy that the only person responsible for voting is the voter. If they are unhappy with a politician, it is in their hands to remove that official. Even if Proposition&rsquo;s case is true &ndash; and they have yet to prove a causal link &ndash; it is young people themselves who can do something about it. The decision not to vote may very well be an active one; that is still a participation in the process.</p>
<p>There is certainly evidence that young people are engaged with the political process through campaigning groups, e-petitions and so forth, Prop is ignoring all of that and viewing democratic participation purely as a process of putting a cross in a box every five years and then forgetting about it.</p>

<p>Politicians, mindful of low turnout in this demographic, rather than seeking to change negative perceptions have, instead, fanned the flames<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote2sym" name="sdendnote2anc"><sup>ii</sup></a></sup>. David Cameron&rsquo;s response to the London riots of 2011 was to announce a raft of policies &ndash; from the reintroduction of national service at sixteen to enforced parenting classes &ndash; all targeted at an entire, supposedly lost, generation. The fact that the riots were the actions of a few hundred people didn&rsquo;t seem to deter him. By contrast the average age of Olympians at the 2012 games was 26 and yet nothing was said on the achievements of the generation<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote3sym" name="sdendnote3anc"><sup>iii</sup></a></sup>.</p>

                    <p>Even just looking back fifty years, one would see a vastly more deferential electorate for whom politicians really were &lsquo;a class apart&rsquo;. Fifty years before that and one sees a generation of parliamentarians who would struggle to place their constituency on a map<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup>. The modern MP makes themselves available through all the traditional means and online, as a result they are likely to be considerably better informed not only about issues concerning young people but of the world around them in general. The idea that full-time MPs would know less about their constituents than their predecessors, many of whom had second jobs and saw being a parliamentarian as a part-time or honorary position, is palpably not true.</p>

                    <p>The last fifteen years has seen an extraordinary shift in the public face of politics. Although there are still too many white, middle-aged, apparently straight men in Westminster and other legislatures, there has been a seismic shift from the situation before 1997.</p>
<p>The age profile has improved &ndash; the average age is still 50 but there are a considerable number of MPs in the twenties and thirties &ndash; which, at the very least suggests that some young people are engaged in politics<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup>. Indeed a fairly frequent complaint in the press is the number of young people who leave university and go straight into politics as Special Advisors as the start of a political career.

                    <p>The number of MPs under thirty has once made it into double digits (ten were elected in 1997<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup>) but otherwise remains negligible. Edinburgh and Cardiff have a marginally better representation but not much.</p>
<p>Opposition argues that the interests of young people change as they age and it was ever thus. This is no doubt true but that can also be said of people in the fifties who will have different interests when they stop work. Considering the relative failure of political parties to deliver candidates that look like the rest of the country, surely it needs to be a requirement that politicians strive to represent those who don&rsquo;t look like them rather than relying on the handful that do.</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s important not to overstate the idea that the current issue of turnout is something that afflicts just this generation. Generally people increase their interest in politics later in life &ndash; along with mortgages, kids and taxes. The youth sections of all parties tend to be the most ideologically driven part of the party<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup> &ndash; their views tend not to make it into party manifestoes because of this as it would tend to lose votes.</p>

Working on the basis that every previous generation has got round to taking an interest in politics as the issues determined by politicians start to affect them, it seems likely to assume that this one will as well. Prop&rsquo;s solution of politician&rsquo;s setting out to deliberately interact with young people is just likely to produce cringe-worthy results<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote3sym" name="sdendnote3anc"><sup>iii</sup></a></sup>.</p>

                    <p>Failing to engage with a third of the electorate on the basis that they&rsquo;ll get involved in fifteen or twenty years time is a shocking statement in a democracy and suggests that the middle aged professionals who make up the political elite are right to only take an interest in other middle-class professionals. As an attitude this may be many things but representative isn&rsquo;t one of al them. Complete and total personal ignorance of a subject may not stop parliamentarians legislating on issues (drugs, the military, abortions) but that is certainly not a reason to encourage it. Regardless of whether this particular group will remain disenfranchised or generations as yet unborn will have even less interest in politics remains to be seen but there is certainly a need for a change of attitude in either case.</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s a fairly basic principle of democracy that the people are, ultimately, in charge. If you don&rsquo;t like the outcome, vote for somebody else. It&rsquo;s not an excuse to say that the other candidates are more of the same &ndash; then stand yourself. The solution to a political situation that ignores a group of voters is to get involved, force politicians to notice you, not to give up.</p>
<p>There are roughly seven million young adults (18-30) in the UK<sup><a href="/print/41593#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup>, more than enough to make a political noise.
