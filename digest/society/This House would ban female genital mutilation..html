    <h1 class="print-title">This House would ban female genital mutilation.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Female genital mutilation or FGM is often referred to as &#39;female circumcision&#39;. It refers to all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for cultural, religious or any other non-medical reasons. Four different types of female genital mutilation are known to be performed today, ranging from piercing or stretching of the clitoris and/or labia to their total removal. The most common form of FGM is complete excision of the clitoris and the labia. The most extreme form of FGM, called infibulation, replaces the vulva with a wall of flesh, except for a pencil-size opening<sup>1</sup>. After excision, the labia are sewn together and the girl&#39;s legs are tied together for around two weeks to prevent her from moving.</p>
<p>The majority of females who have undergone FGM are from twenty-eight African countries, found mostly in the band that stretches from Senegal in West Africa to Somalia on the East coast, and from Egypt in the north to Tanzania in the south. In these regions, it is estimated that more than 92 million girls have undergone this procedure<sup>2</sup>. However, FGM is also practiced in some parts of Asia, the Middle East and increasingly by African immigrants living in Australia, Canada and the USA. As of today, approximately 140 million women have undergone FGM. It is estimated that three million girls each year are likely to be subject to FGM procedures.</p>
<p>Even within cultures where FGM is the accepted norm, the procedure, purpose, and typical age at which FGM is performed varies widely. FGM is practiced by followers of a religious belief as well as non-believers, for sociological reasons as well as mythical ones. FGM is usually carried out with crude medical instruments and without anesthetic, but sometimes may be performed in a health care facility with modern medical amenities. FGM can be performed on infants only a few days old, female children or adolescents, or even on mature women<sup>3</sup>. The average age for the majority of FGM procedures, however, is between four and fifteen years of age.</p>
<p>Despite these variations of FGM, the World Health Organization is universally opposed to medicalization of all types of FGM. Most human rights organizations in the Western world, Africa and Asia consider FGM a violation of human rights<sup>4</sup>. Proponents of FGM object to the use of the word &quot;mutilation&quot;, arguing that it reinforces the idea that this practice is a violation of human rights. They point out that local languages generally use the less judgmental &quot;cutting&quot; to describe the procedure. In 1999 the UN adopted the term &quot;cutting&quot; to avoid demonizing certain cultures, religions and communities, but the practice is still almost universally referred to as &quot;FGM&quot;. The proposition will need to prove that a ban would be a justified and effective means of protecting women.</p>

                    <p>Global institutions are better equipped to comparatively analyze the facts about FGM and therefore need to prohibit the practice of FGM so that those ignorant to the consequences of the practice will be protected. Global organizations are also the only bodies that can ensure that marriage networks give up the practice simultaneously so that no woman is socially handicapped. This process proved successful in China in the early 20th century when the practice of foot binding was rapidly abandoned<sup>1</sup>. It requires sufficient funding for large scale education efforts and adequate enforcement, a financial requirement that only these large organizations can meet<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Human Rights declarations and treaties, like the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child, which draw upon local cultural and religious notions of common sense, justice and dignity, are often the best way to promote human rights and change the cultural norms that violate them. After all, every country has signed up to these universal standards, and it is our moral duty to enforce them, for example by threatening to withhold aid from states which are not serious about tackling the FGM issue. Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt (Ministerial decree), Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria (multiple states), Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States have all banned the practice.

                    <p>Making this a blanket policy coming from international organizations, and human rights treaties, will likely only create backlash against the invasion of Western culture. This has been seen in the past, where for example, in the Sudan the British and Egyptians forced the practice to be ended in the 1970s, which only forced it to happen in secret, girls were cut at an earlier age, and they were not taken to medical professionals if complications arose<a href="/print/17722#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.

                    <p>While many believe that FGM is associated with the tenets of a religion, this is in fact not the case. Different religious leaders condone, deem it irrelevant, or discourage it, but there is no one religion that explicitly says FGM is a necessary practice<a href="/print/17722#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Therefore, banning FGM is not declaring a religion wrong and does not debunk the fundamental beliefs of a group of people. Instead, it is competing with a cultural practice that shows a woman’s purity, considered to be harmful to her. Cultures change and adapt as they come into modernity—foot binding is no longer practiced in China, although it was a deep seeded tradition. However, as long as it remains culturally valued for women to be ‘cut’ and men only want to marry ‘cut’ women the practice will continue<a href="/print/17722#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Therefore, there needs to be a total ban on the practice so that all women are ‘uncut’ otherwise, not undergoing the procedure will continue to carry stigma in some societies. The practice has been replaced within some groups, with one that celebrates and serves the same purpose, but does not involve cutting<a href="/print/17722#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. FGM is not a necessary part of religion and the fundamental beliefs of the groups that practice it. So, it is not insensitive to ban it. And, a ban is the only way to make being ‘uncut’ the norm within these cultures.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17722#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm" title="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm">http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/fem...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17722#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/" title="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17722#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm" title="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm">http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/fem...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Whether it is tied to religion, does not justify calling a cultural tradition wrong. Conservative Jews believe that piercings, tattoos, and any other form of changing the body are wrong, yet it is accepted that they have the right to believe what they do. The most important factor is choice—people are allowed to choose what they do with their bodies and what they believe. Telling them this is wrong is not appropriate. This applies to genital cutting as well. Telling groups of people who have historically practiced cutting that this is inherently bad is not sensitive or justified. Education and safe practices should instead be promoted so that people can make educated decisions.</p>        </div>

The right to bodily integrity is perhaps the most fundamental right we enjoy as civilized human beings<sup>1</sup>. FGM is a form of illegal body modification and the mutilation of those too young to give their informed consent. Most are not given the choice as they would be socially marginalized if they were 'uncut'. Genital mutilation may leave a lasting mark on the life and mind of the woman who has undergone it. In the longer term, women may suffer feelings of incompleteness, anxiety and depression. FGM is also a form of violence against women and a direct expression of patriarchal oppression. FGM has been practiced by some cultures solely in order to maintain the chastity and virginity of a woman before marriage, to ensure fidelity during marriage, and to increase male sexual pleasure<sup>2</sup>. FGM additionally violates her right to equal opportunity, to not be discriminated against, to freedom from violence, injury, abuse, torture, cruel or inhuman treatment, protection from harmful traditional practices and the freedom to make reproductive decisions, all of which are protected under international law<sup>3</sup>. It takes a woman's body out of her own control, and ultimately inflicts long term pain and suffering, none of which can be justified.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/"> http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm"> <a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm" title="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm">http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/fem...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span> </a></p><p><sup>3</sup><a href="http://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/humanrights/resources/child.asp"> <a href="http://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/humanrights/resources/child.asp" title="http://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/humanrights/resources/child.asp">http://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/humanrights/resources/child.asp</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span> </a></p>        </div>

This only promotes the need for increased education and choice in regards to genital cutting, versus a total ban. If women choose that they would like to undergo the practice, then they should be allowed to, considering that denying them this option is also violating their right to free choice and bodily expression.

                    <p>Tostan is one specific group working in 7 different countries in Africa that has been extremely successful in combatting FGM. Their approach is not critical, blaming, judging, or banning but instead educating about FGM and allowing people to come to their own conclusions. Through working on the community level, with a deep understanding of the culture, Tostan has led 6,236 communities in seven countries to abandon FGM. Therefore there is no need to impose a solution or ban from outside, we should simply encourage and support local people in their efforts to extend choice to women. These types of efforts are much more likely to be successful, than a judgmental ban from the international community that more likely will lead to backlash than anything else.</p>        </div>

                    <p>When this practice was banned in the Sudan in the 1970s by the British and Egyptians, it just forced FGM underground, and meant that women did not seek medical attention when something went wrong<sup>1</sup>. The procedure, when performed without any anesthetic, can lead to death through shock or excessive bleeding. Instead of banning the practice and then letting it occur in an even more dangerous manner, with glass, rusty razors, and dull knives for instruments, it should be regulated to promote safe practices. There has been a movement towards 'medicalization' of the practice where less of the tissue is cut, and a local anesthetic is used<sup>2</sup>. While this might not be ideal, if the practice is going to continue, which it likely will considering the importance that it plays in family honor and marriage, it should be as safe as possible. Many of the largest objections to the practice are because of the way it is carried out, which means it should be better regulated and performed in medical facilities<sup>3</sup>. Driving the practice underground only makes it more dangerous.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.tostan.org/data/files/mackieasrnew.pdf"> <a href="http://www.tostan.org/data/files/mackieasrnew.pdf" title="http://www.tostan.org/data/files/mackieasrnew.pdf">http://www.tostan.org/data/files/mackieasrnew.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span> </a><br><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/medicalization_fgm_kenya/en/index.html"> <a href="http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/medicalization_fgm_kenya/en/index.html" title="http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/medicalization_fgm_kenya/en/index.html">http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/medicalization_fgm_keny...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span> </a><br><sup>3</sup><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml"> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span> </a></p>        </div>

                    <p>Beyond the underground cutting practices that would likely arise due to a ban, the fact that not everyone would be ‘uncut’—either because they underwent an illegal procedure, or it was done before the ban—would make life more difficult for those who opted out. Undergoing this procedure is considered a sign of a woman’s strength, and her readiness for future challenges in adult life<a href="/print/17722#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. If cutting were prohibited, some communities would develop a hostile view of women. In some cultures, to prohibit a woman from receiving FGM is to significantly disadvantage her in finding a husband<a href="/print/17722#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. This disadvantage will also be thrust upon women without having obtained their informed consent and will create other family problems. Many women across the world, but particularly in the African communities where this practice exists, are dependent on their husbands, and making it difficult for a girl to find a husband reduces her livelihood<a href="/print/17722#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. &nbsp;Some cultures would order immediate divorce for unexcised women, who could then be subject to derogatory songs and public jeering. It is a human rights violation to subject women to this type of treatment, and take away their choice as to what they want to do with their bodies, no matter how unpalatable the West find the practice.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17722#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17722#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17722#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.codesria.org/IMG/pdf/Gaidzanwa.pdf" title="http://www.codesria.org/IMG/pdf/Gaidzanwa.pdf">http://www.codesria.org/IMG/pdf/Gaidzanwa.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Immediate complications of female genital mutilation include severe pain, shock, hemorrhage, urine retention, ulceration of the genital region and injury to adjacent tissue<sup>1</sup>. Hemorrhaging and infection can cause death. Long-term consequences include cysts and abscesses, keloid scar formation, damage to the urethra resulting in urinary incontinence, dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) and sexual dysfunction, as well as difficulties with childbirth<sup>2</sup>. More recently, concern has arisen about possible transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) due to the use of a single instrument in multiple operations<sup>3</sup>. The fundamental goal of human society is preservation, and it is the responsibility of world-wide organizations to safeguard human sustainability. This goal is compromised in cultures that practice FGM. Deliveries to women who have undergone FGM are significantly more likely to be complicated by caesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, and episiotomy, extended maternal hospital stay, resuscitation of the infant, and inpatient prenatal death, than deliveries to women who have not had FGM. It was estimated in a June 2006 WHO study that 10 to 20 babies per thousand births die during delivery as a result of the practice of FGM<sup>4</sup>. Additionally 25-30% of women who undergo FGM are left infertile<sup>5</sup>. FGM jeopardizes maternal and infant health and therefore cannot be justified. The health consequences that it causes mean it should not be allowed to continue.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/"> http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span><br><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm"> <a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm" title="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm">http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/fem...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span> </a><br><sup>3</sup><a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm"> <a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm" title="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm">http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/fem...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span> </a><br><sup>4</sup><a href="http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/publications/aonsectionIII_1.pdf"> <a href="http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/publications/aonsectionIII_1.pdf" title="http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/publications/aonsectionIII_1.pdf">http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/publications/aonsectionIII_1.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span> </a><br><sup>5</sup><a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm"> <a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm" title="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm">http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/fem...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span> </a></p>        </div>

                    <p>Human rights are a cultural construct and the priority given to particular rights varies from one society to another. Many people believe female circumcision to be a religious duty, so the issue creates a conflict of rights. It is associated with the reputation of a girl, her family, and her ability to get married<sup>1</sup>. It Is also performed as a coming of age ritual and rite of passage. Most parents are not malicious in their intents to 'cut' their daughters, but are instead helping them get along in their society and culture<sup>2</sup>. Outlawing cutting damages the survivability of certain indigenous cultures in our increasingly hostile "global" social environment. It damages people's identification with their cultural heritage, their initiation of girls into womanhood, and the maintenance of social cohesion within a community. Outlawing FGM will contribute to the decline of sustainable human societies. Ultimately, women need to be given a choice. Another fundamental right we enjoy as civilized human beings is the freedom to choose. Equipping women with the facts about female reproduction and the health effects of FGM will enable them to evaluate the practice in a neutral and objective way versus the feeling of having to justify themselves to Western critics.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm"> <a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm" title="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm">http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/fem...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span> </a><br><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm"> <a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm" title="http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/female-genital-cutting.cfm">http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/fem...</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span> </a></p>        </div>
