    <h1 class="print-title">This House Believes That Feminism Is Still Needed</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Feminism is relatively difficult to define, both because of the breadth of the movement, which includes a wide diversity of views and some vigorous internal debate, and because it is so frequently caricatured by its opponents. A fair description might be that it is a movement committed to the pursuit of equality, notably but not exclusively sexual equality. It is based on an analysis of inequality rooted in the social transformation of sex (the real, biological differences between men and women) into gender (the various ways in which men and women are perceived as having different abilities and social roles), and the ways in which gender is implicated in unequal power relationships between men and women in many areas of life.</p><p>Feminism assumes that such treatment is cultural and thus possible to change and not simply "the way the world is and must be". Feminism looks to a different culture as possible, and values moving towards that culture. It consists of activism, individually and in groups, to make personal and social change towards that more desirable culture. Important topics for feminist theory and politics include: the body, class and work, disability, the family, globalization, human rights, popular culture, race and racism, reproduction, science, the self, sex work, human trafficking, and sexuality.</p><p>For years women have fought for their rights. Once women gained rights in society (including the right to vote in 1928 via the representation of the People Act 1928, in America in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and in Australia in 1902) they were no longer willing to be treated as second class citizens in the home or in the work place. But almost a century later has this feminist movement achieved its end goal of complete equality, or are there still battles to be fought by the feminist movement?&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-editors">

                    <p>Feminism is still of relevance today, and is indeed needed. In the UK, one in four women suffers domestic violence, and an increase in the reporting of rape in the last thirty years has gone alongside a threefold drop in conviction rates. In countries such as Ireland and Malta abortion is still not legal for all women, this can be seen as an important part of equality for woman that has not been achieved yet and needs to be fought for.&nbsp; If we take feminism as a global movement then the movement is still of huge importance. That's because U.S. women still earned only 77 cents on the male dollar in 2008, according to the latest census statistics. (That number drops to 68% for African-American women and 58% for Latinas.) <a href="/print/17794#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> These are all real problems, on which feminists continue to campaign - as they should.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17794#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1983185,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1983185,00.html#ixzz1TtHZOvXp</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Feminism has no more battles left to fight. Victories such as gaining the vote, the right to an abortion(in most of the northern hemisphere) and the right to equal pay were important and worth winning. But given that sexual equality is now - rightly - enshrined and protected in law, there is nothing left for the feminist movement to do in most western countries. It may still be useful in parts of the world where women still lack basic democratic and other rights. However, in western society the feminist cause in no longer needed.</p>        </div>

It is therefore hard to argue that the glass ceiling has disintegrated.

                    <p>Employers worry when they hire young/middle aged women. They fear that after hiring a woman, she will only cost the company money by getting pregnant and going on maternity leave. To combat this attitude, maternity and paternity leave should be equal. Currently, paternity leave is a maximum of two consecutive weeks. These two weeks must be taken within 56 days of the child’s birth. This can be contrasted with the long maternity leave that is allowed for. Women are entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave from day one of employment. Women are entitled to maternity pay for 39 weeks if they have been working for their employer for 26 weeks.</p><p>Father’s also do not have the right to take time off work to attend antenatal classes, this allowance is for pregnant employees only. The feminist cause still has this issue to resolve. Until paternity leave is offered an employer can safely assume that a woman will be the partner to burden the care of the child and the employer will be the one to bear these costs of maternity leave. This gives men an unfair advantage in the workplace as they are a “safer bet” for employment.</p>        </div>

The truth is that, the lack of any kind of paternity leave for the male, indicates that there is a "glass ceiling" hovering over fathers heads, and is preventing them from being good parents. It would benefit every family, if fathers were allowed to spend time with their new borns, like women can.</p><p>This is not a battle for the feminist cause.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17794#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.opm.gov/oca/leave/html/ParentalReport.htm">http://www.opm.gov/oca/leave/html/ParentalReport.htm</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>By focusing on women and their problems, feminism fails to recognise that there are inequality issues in which men are the victims. For example: boys are falling behind girls in academic achievement; far less money is spent on combating ‘male’ than ‘female’ diseases (the difference between the amount of research into breast cancer and prostate cancer is a striking.)<a href="/print/17794#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>Single fathers are discriminated against over child custody and child support; fear of being accused of sexism is so widespread that it often leads to unfair discrimination against men.<a href="/print/17794#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>Even the way men are portrayed in the media is a cause for concern. Last year, an oven cleaner ad drew a thousand-plus complaints for the slogan, “So easy, even a man can use it.” These can only be tackled by recognising that feminism has gone too far. The battle for equality is no longer needed but rather, we must remember feminism was never a tool for women to get their own back.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17794#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://themahima.com/?p=3667">http://themahima.com/?p=3667</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17794#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="file:///C:/Dropbox/Debatewise%20-%20DC/IDEA/debatewise%20-%20web%20site/merging/completed%20debates/Rebecca%20Keating/www.mens-rights.net">www.mens-rights.net</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There are two responses to this. First, many of the ways in which men suffer inequality are relatively minor when compared to the ongoing subordination of women in many areas of private and public life such as pay, childcare and sexuality. Second, where such inequality does exist, feminism possesses the resources to offer a distinctive and useful critique of the causes and consequences of sexual inequality, whether it is men or women who suffer as a result - men and women should be joining forces to offer feminist responses to discrimination, not blaming feminism where men have problems disconnected from the feminist cause.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Feminism is a rights movement to place the female sex on equal footing as males. This naturally means that when an inequality exists it needs to be corrected. Yes, even when women have an apparent advantage in something over men it needs to be fixed. It is true men are given lower rights in certain cases. The results of divorce with children involved comes to mind. However, this, like many issues, will be solved in time through feminism. The main issue with this particular example is that women are seen as primary caregivers and are given the responsibility to be in that position. By showing women can succeed in traditionally male dominated areas it also opens the oppurtunity for men to step into female dominated areas. When men and women are seen as equal caregivers then there is less bias to grant custody to a mother over an equal father.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Many women no longer identify themselves as feminists, associating feminism with man-hating, sex-hating humourlessness, and seeing it as a relic of the 1970s.

                    <p>Opponents of the feminist movement have always sought to stereotype feminists in order to reduce their support. That this enterprise is often successful is not an argument against feminism; in any case, many of the women who dislike the label ‘feminist’ turn out to hold what would until recently have been seen as extreme feminist views, such as the belief that women are perfectly capable of competing with men on equal terms. Feminists have always argued that women are just as capable of men; they have campaigned against legal, cultural and social barriers which have worked against women, preventing them from achieving equality.</p>        </div>

                    <p>There is certainly a case to be made that women, in modern-western society have completely shattered the traditional values and roles that are best suited to them.</p><p>For example, it has always been the case that men have been the providers, the defenders of themselves, the household and the family. Women have been the maintainers of these things. These things are not unfair. They are not unequal. They are simply what each gender is best suited for.</p><p>Women should not feel lesser than men simply because they are "supposed" to do "motherly things".&nbsp;The feminist movement has gone beyond its cause in beginning to deem what role in life is more appropriate.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Feminism is not about judging women for choices they make. It is about allowing women to make that choice. If we haven’t got to a point where all woman are given the choice either to stay in the home or advance equally in their career or do both then this is a point to indicate that feminism is still needed and relevant. In many ways women are still dictated to about the way they should act or what should interest them. Girls are told in school that science is more of a “boys subject”, while subjects such as wood work are rarely offered in all girls schools. In the media magazines tell girls how to “please your man” further cementing the idea, that women have long fought to remove, that women are solely the object of a man’s desire.</p><p>Stereotypes of women still exist and as long as they still exist in the minds of many, feminism still has an active role to play in dispelling these stereotypes. Take rape for an example. There are definitely legislative parts that need to be drastically improved and also better policing, but one way to challenge the cause of rape is to&nbsp;challenge traditional perceptions of the role of men. Why do men rape? Is it something to do with a certain perception of domination, a need to feel powerful? If this is the case can we challenge the traditional&nbsp;pressures and perceptions placed on men that they are the powerful ones. We may have challenged stereotypes about women, but it is still very difficult for men to feel comfortable expressing a 'feminine side.' All of these male stereotypes must also be tackled if we want to establish equality, which is what feminism has always been about.<br>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
