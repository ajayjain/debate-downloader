    <div class="print-content"><p>Affirmative action (or positive discrimination) is the use of different standards for assessing different groups of people, so as to help a group that has historically been at a disadvantage.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a><a href="/print/18084#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> In an education context, the relevant type of affirmative action is that used for admission to universities. In particular, universities may wish to use affirmative action to raise the presence of poor students or students from ethnic minorities. There are several Affirmative Action policies which occur around the world from New Zealand where the Maori minority is favoured to South Africa where the legacy of Apartheid aims to be corrected to the United States where Black and Hispanic students may be given preferential treatment in admission procedures.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a><a href="/print/18084#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Such discrimination is a controversial issue, notably in the United States, where a 2003 Supreme Court decision ruled that universities are allowed to use the practice.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> Debates may either be about permitting universities to use positive discrimination (where it is currently illegal), or about the state requiring them to do so. The mechanism could be one of two types: either using quotas to determine the outcome of the admissions process (e.g. requiring universities to admit a certain percentage of students from minority groups, deprived areas, or non-private schools), or by using different admissions criteria that take race, poverty or school-background into account.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18084#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Fullinwider, Robert, "Affirmative Action", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N.

                    <p>Affirmative action is required for equality of opportunity. Under the status quo, it is easier for students who go to better schools to get into university. This is reflected in data from the UK - Oxford and Cambridge universities (the top academic institutions) take more than 50% of their students from private schools, despite 93% of UK schoolchildren state educated.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In addition, there is a clear underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in these universities.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> A similar story is evident with regards to ethnic minorities in the USA - white students are more likely to graduate from high school and go to college than black and Hispanic ones.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a><a href="/print/18084#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>&nbsp;These examples reflect the opportunities granted to wealthier children from particular socioeconomic and racial groups, whose superior education and less disruptive home lives give them a leg-up. It is unfair that such random aspects, which have nothing to do with talent or hard work, have such a determining influence on one’s life chances. Moreover, it undermines meritocracy – by allowing the rich to be advantaged, we create a society in which wealth, rather than ability, is rewarded.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18084#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Sagar, P. “The truth about Oxbridge admissions: a reply To Dave Osler”.

                    <p>Though affirmative action wishes to create an equality of opportunity for the poor and ethnic minorities, it also creates an unfair situation in which talented students lose their places. Ability may ultimately not be rewarded as the whole point of affirmative action is to promote a less able applicant ahead of a more able one, measured by their test scores. It undermines the fairness of the system if reasonable objective measures of a person’s ability, such as exam performance and aptitude testing, are overlooked. Under a system of positive discrimination, able students from the majority group or who went to private school are required to achieve more than others to get the same reward. Furthermore, positive discrimination is bad for the talented students from the target group who would get into university even without affirmative action: the policy will undermine their achievement, making their peers (and even them) believe that they only got to where they were because of different standards. It would create a two-tiered university system, in which the achievements of one group were elevated above the achievements of another.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Affirmative action is required to overcome existing prejudice in universities’ admissions procedures. There is clear prejudice in the job market, as shown in a study by Marianne Bertrand, an associate professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, and Sendhil Mullainathan of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a><a href="/print/18084#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> &nbsp;Following this line of thinking, it is therefore not a far-fetched idea that admissions departments in top universities are likely to be discriminating against applicants from minority backgrounds, even if this process is not deliberate. A senior academic will look to see in applicants qualities they see in themselves, so, given the overwhelmingly white, affluent, male makeup of the academic community, minorities are at a disadvantage even if the admissions officer is not intending to discriminate against them. Prejudice towards certain types of applicants is blatantly unfair, and also undermines meritocracy (as explained above). Since we do not expect applicants from minority backgrounds to actually be worse applicants, it makes sense to require universities to take more of them, so as to protect the system from any bias that may exist.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18084#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Bertrand, M. “Racial Bias in Hiring”.&nbsp; Spring 2003. <a href="http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/spring03/racialbias.html">http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/spring03/racialbias.html</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/18084#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> BBC News Magazine. “Is it wrong to note 100m winners are always black?” August 27, 2011. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14679657">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14679657</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There is little or no evidence of bias in universities admissions procedures. Universities admissions departments go to great lengths to ensure fairness, not least because it is in their own self-interest to take only the best applicants, to maintain the intellectual credibility of their institution. Any overt or explicit discrimination would be illegal, and should be guarded against by using a wide range of admissions procedures and interview (where applicable) by more than one academic. Any charge of prejudice would be an argument for ‘colour-blind’ (or school-blind) admissions, in which the background of the applicant is hidden from the admissions officer, so as to prevent any possibility of discrimination, subconscious or otherwise. The presence of positive discrimination would, if anything, raise the incidence of racism and prejudice on university campuses, with lecturers and fellow students resentful of members of the university perceived to have been given a helping hand.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Affirmative action is required to change negative perceptions of university life. In the status quo, many talented potential students are put off applying for top universities (or university at all) because of their negative perceptions of elite institutions. This perception exists in part because of the makeup of the student population – black high school students may see a university filled overwhelmingly with white lecturers and students as not being a welcoming environment for them, and may even perceive it as racist.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The only way to overcome this unfortunate stereotype of university is to change the student population, but this is impossible to do ‘organically’ while so few people from minority backgrounds apply. Therefore, it is necessary to use quotas and other forms of affirmative action, to change the student body in the short term, and encourage applications from more disadvantaged students in the long term.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18084#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Ancis, J.R. “Student perceptions of campus cultural climate by race”.

                    <p>Positive discrimination will increase negative perceptions of university. Far from changing attitudes about campus life among disadvantaged groups, positive discrimination is likely to be seen as patronising, belittling of the achievements of ethnic minorities and the working class, and serve to reinforce negative stereotypes<sup>15</sup>. By making the statement that disadvantaged groups are so far behind the rest that they need discrimination in their favour and quotas, universities will alienate themselves from the group they are seeking to help, and will come over as elitist. Survey evidence suggests that affirmative action is usually opposed by the target group, affirming the view that people wish to achieve things for themselves, without being given a ‘leg-up’ by the state. Moreover, positive discrimination devalues the achievements of those who would have been accepted into university even without the assistance, and these people are likely to be deterred from applying.</p>        </div>

                    <p>College admission processes are impersonal and favourably biased towards white, affluent students – therefore, quotas specifically for minority students need to be established. College admissions processes are as such because they heavily rely on standard tests or college admission exams. This has caused countries such as Brazil to create quotas for brown (mixed) and black students in most universities.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> These students cannot afford the better education enjoyed by their rich, white counterparts, and therefore do not perform well in college exams and do not gain admission into university.

                    <p>Quotas create stigmas and enforce negative stereotypes about ethnic minorities. It means that students from these groups are incapable of entering universities on their own. And during their time at university, the students may face the stigma of being known as a “quota student”. This may cause students to feel inferior and lose self-confidence, and this may ultimately affect their academic performance. In addition, quotas do not solve the root cause of the problem. The best way to help the poor and ethnic minorities is through investments in public schools and basic services so that at the end of the day, admission tests are a true reflection of academic ability and not as a result of economy and geography.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18084#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Stahlberg, S.G. “Racial Inequality and Affirmative Action in Education in Brazil”.

                    <p>By having more students from disadvantaged backgrounds get into university and ultimately have access to top professions, and more likely to enter politics, law, or become the heads of major corporations, affirmative action will generate more role models for the poor and ethnic minorities. As a consequence, the aspirations of disadvantaged youths will change – it will become more realistic for them to see themselves in public life, and will thus have a better incentive to work hard at school. Not only is this good for their own development, but it will also help wider society by tackling social problems such as petty crime and truancy.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Under the policy of affirmative action, there is a real danger that social tensions become inflamed. This is because in the process of benefiting minority groups it helps to disenfranchise the majority. For example in the 2001 riots in Oldham and other cities of Northern England one of the main complaints from poor white areas was alleged discrimination in council funding.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> There was a possibility that the more privileged from minority groups such as upper-class blacks will be favoured at the expense of the marginalised within majority groups such as lower-class whites.

                    <p>Social tension, especial in poor areas and minority groups, does not come as a result of unfair affirmative action policies, but as a result of inadequate funds available to the communities which result in individuals struggling for limited resources. Affirmative Action creates an opportunity whereby more politicians and businesspeople rise up from humble backgrounds are given the chance to change the political and economic structure of society. By “giving back” to their community, they will be able to assist the less well-off, for example by expanding welfare systems and ensuring greater equality of opportunities, or through different hiring practices.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The underlying issue which affirmative action tries to gloss over is the embedded social problems which put the poor and ethnic monitories in continual disadvantages generation after generation. This policy merely papers over the cracks by masking the fact that the failures of state-funded schooling and attempts at integration have led to a situation in which ethnic minorities and the poor are so vastly underrepresented in universities. The state should do more to address these underlying problems, rather than covering up its failures with a tokenistic policy. Better funding of state schools, real parental choice in education, and accountability through the publication of comparable examination data would all drive up standards and allow more underprivileged children to fulfil their potential.<a href="/print/18084#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a><a href="/print/18084#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18084#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Gryphon, M. “The Affirmative Action Myth”.
