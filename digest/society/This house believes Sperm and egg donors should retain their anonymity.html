    <h1 class="print-title">This house believes Sperm and egg donors should retain their anonymity</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Organised sperm and egg donation has gone on for decades, as the medical science of fertility treatment has sought to help couples unable to conceive naturally have their own children. Sperm donation is the more common, with men being paid a little money for samples of their ejaculate (although many do it to help family and friends, or out of a wider sense of altruism to help couples they will never meet). Egg donation also takes place, but is both rarer and better remunerated, as the procedures are much more uncomfortable for the woman involved (again, many women donate eggs for altruistic reasons rather than financial ones). Almost always, the sperm is used to fertilise an egg from the woman of the couple wishing to have a child, who then bears the baby herself and brings it up with her partner as entirely their own (cases of egg donation are essentially similar, although the details of fertilisation and embryo implantation are different).In almost all countries sperm and egg donors have been anonymous, having no contact with the child they have helped to conceive and the parents who bring it up. This is still the cases in most countries, for example the USA, although some donors do choose to waive their right to anonymity and the parents bringing the child up are usually encouraged to be honest with him or her about their origins. The UK, however, brought in new rules in 2005 so that new donors could not be anonymous (the law is not retrospective, so that previous donors can still remain unknown). Under the new UK law a child of donor assisted-conception can ask when they are 18 to be given the details of their biological parent, possibly allowing them to make contact with the donor. This was highly controversial when it was passed, and remains so today. The debate continues, as at present the parents who will bring the child up do not have to put the biological donor-parent&#39;s name on the birth-certificate, allowing them to conceal the fact of a donor&#39;s involvement from their child. Some argue that the policy of lifting anonymity should therefore be extended to include naming both biological parents on the birth certificate.</p>

                    <p>The concept of parenthood in the context of donor-assisted conception is complicated. Is someone who donated an egg or some sperm really a parent? Shouldn't parent mean the one who cared for you as a baby, got up in the night for you, saw you through teething and childhood illnesses, and worked hard to give you food, shelter and the best life they were able to provide? In the case of children seeking the mother who gave them up for adoption, this is permissible specifically because of the relationship built up during pregnancy and birth<sup>1</sup>. In the case of sperm donors, 'whether for money or out of altruism, the father has gone into a cubicle and masturbated into a container. There is a difference'<sup>1</sup>. As such, given that donors never actually meet or speak to the real parents or the actual children, the situation is not at all like adoption or even surrogacy. It is more like blood donation, and therefore gives the recipient no rights over the donor.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/apr/05/comment.law">Berlins, M.

                    <p>Sperm and egg donors are biological, and therefore the only objectively true, parents. Therefore, they have to accept that a child conceived using their material assumes 50% of their DNA, and inevitably thereafter will be linked to them. Donors who enter into the process must therefore accept that children are naturally going to be curious about where half of themselves originated. As Olivia Merricks, who used a sperm donor to have her daughter Zannah, argues, 'I think people should only be donors if they understand that need to know more about yourself'<sup>1</sup>. Nowhere else in the law are children denied the right to know who their parents are if the information is available. This reflects the widely-held, and very natural, notion that learning about yourself is one of the fundamental driving forces of life. We ask our parents questions not just to know about their lives, but to understand how we came to be. It is to our parents that we direct such questions specifically because we share their genes. As such, donors cannot deny they are true parents.</p><p>1.BBC news, 2005&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There are strong medical reasons to know who your biological mother or father is, as many illnesses (e.g. some cancers) have genetic components. Scientific discoveries make it clear that genetics plays a very strong part in forming our character and characteristics, and many donor-conceived children naturally want to seek the truth about their origins. Donors therefore have a responsibility to allow any child conceived through their donation to contact them later in search of vital medical information. The initial information given may have been inadequate, or issues could have arisen since the donorship that should be passed onto offspring. In 2002, parents of 18 children had to be warned that children had a 50% chance of developing a specific hereditary disorder after the sperm donor developed a late onset genetic disease<sup>1</sup>. In countries with stronger anonymity laws, such warnings could not have been passed on to offspring.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1122572/"> Sheldon, T.

                    <p>Full disclosure is not necessary for children to be made aware of genetic defects or heritable illnesses. Donors provide full medical records, sometimes even a DNA sample, before they provide sperm or eggs. That is more information than many patients have about a parent, and does not require the full identity of the donor to be revealed. The Dutch example is not an argument in favour of removing anonymity laws, but merely a closer relationship between donor banks and donors to ensure that if such issues arise, parents of donor children can be notified. It is notable that in the opposition's example, the anonymity did not have to lifted in order to pass the message along.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Removing anonymity will meet a psychological need to know where we come from and why we look and act the way we do. As Zannah Merricks, an 18-year-old conceived with the help of donor sperm, reveals, 'I want to know the other half of where I'm from, I want to know my genetic history. And it would be interesting to know what traits I have that we might share, what we might have in common'<sup>1</sup>. Donor children, understandably, want to be able to trace family trees - to understand who their ancestors were, where they lived, how they survived - in order to have a sense of self-identity. A fear of incest can also drive this need to know, especially when children are themselves considering marriage and starting a family. The law can make it clear that donor fathers and mothers have no financial or legal responsibility for any children conceived with their sperm or egg.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4398551.stm">BBC News.

                    <p>People may wish to find out who their biological father is, but it is not always a good idea, and they are not always psychologically better off as a result. Their quest for the "truth" may pull apart their real family, hurting the parents who poured so much love and effort into bringing them into the world and then bringing them up to adulthood. It may leave the child themselves confused and rootless, especially if they can't ultimately track down their biological donor-parent, or if they do and the person doesn't want to know them, or doesn't match their imaginings. And what about the effect on the donor themselves, eighteen or more years on from their brief session in a clinic cubicle? What impact might it have on them psychologically, especially if they now have a real family of their own? And although the law now may say that a child of assisted-conception has no legal or financial claim on the donor, who can say what rights a future court might not discover?</p>        </div>

                    <p>Children have a right to know who their real parents are. This is already the case with adoption, where anyone has the right to see a copy of their birth certificate when they are 18, giving them the choice to find out about, and perhaps meet their biological parents. As Katrina Clark, a donor child, asserts, ‘we offspring are recognizing the right that was stripped from us at birth – the right to know who both our parents are’ <sup>1</sup>. The UK law lifting the anonymity of donors merely gives donor children equality with adopted children; it should be followed by other countries where donor children, seeking their biological parents, are currently told ‘we know who it is but we won’t tell you’ <sup>2</sup>. As the British Government described, ‘children’s rights to discover their genetic origins outweigh donors’ rights to privacy’ <sup>3</sup>. Putting this policy in place encourages parents to be honest with children in their early years, because they know that at 18 they can find out the truth, especially if the policy of lifting anonymity is extended to putting both biological parents’ names on the birth certificate.</p><p>1.Clark, 2006</p><p>2.

Many children are conceived through one-night stands and never know their fathers – should they have the right to access a DNA database of the whole male population in order to find them? What about children conceived as a result of rape? And what about children conceived through infidelity, where the husband and the child are led by the mother wrongly to believe that they are biologically related?</p><p>Further, even if it was the case that children have a right to know who their parents are, they would already have access to his ‘height, education, ethnic group and age’, why should they be able to insist on his name and address? <sup>1.&nbsp;</sup></p><p>1.Berlins, 2006</p>        </div>

                    <p>Few would-be sperm or egg donors wish to be known to any children resulting from their donation. Removing anonymity is therefore a major deterrent, especially as in most countries little money is paid for sperm donations (more is paid for eggs because the procedure is much more intrusive and unpleasant for a female donor). It was widely predicted that removing anonymity in the UK would result in a fall in donations, and this has in fact happened for both eggs and sperm – despite government claims that sperm donors have increased, the number of actual donations has crucially gone down. As the Times reports, the number of women treated with donated sperm fell by 20 per cent in the first year anonymity was lifted, reflecting the reduced number of sperm donations <sup>1</sup>. Egg treatments are similarly down, by 40%, a ‘catastrophic drop’ according to a British Member of Parliament&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp; If the donor name were to appear on the actual birth certificate of any child, it is obvious that even fewer people will be prepared to donate. Given the desperation of infertile couples seeking assistance with conception, and the long waiting lists for both eggs and sperm, the predictable consequence of this policy is both lamentable and cruel.</p><p>1.&nbsp;Henderson, 2008</p>        </div>

                    <p>Removing donor anonymity does not deter donor populations overall, but it does alter the composition of the donor population. Instead of young single men who do not have children, it tends to be older men, who do have children and who see that what they are doing is creating a family, who come forward'<sup>1</sup>. For example, in Sweden, where anonymity has been lifted, after an initial fall, the profile changed in just this manner<sup>1</sup>. Furthermore, the UK policy of removing anonymity has also not affected the number of sperm donors negatively. The numbers had fallen for three years leading up to 2005, when anonymity was lifted, but increased somewhat in the two years following, with a 6% rise in the number of donors<sup>2</sup>. The number of egg donors is down somewhat, but the reasons for this have much more to do with wider issues of publicity and incentives than with anonymity.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4397249.stm">BBC News.

                    <p>Because lifting anonymity makes it so much more difficult to conceive a child through the government's regulated health care system, desperate couples will be driven to look for alternatives. Estimates suggest that, in the UK where anonymity has been lifted, one in seven couples have fertility problems<sup>1</sup>. However, with long waits for donors expected after the policy change, many are increasingly turning to riskier, unregulated options. Women will be tempted to seek sperm informally from male friends (the Do-It-Yourself "turkey baster" approach), which can cause frictions among friendship groups. Couples will also go abroad as "fertility tourists", seeking eggs and sperm in countries where donors can still remain anonymous<sup>2</sup>. Such consequences are clearly bad for everyone, being unregulated, often emotionally messy, and possibly even dangerous. The evidence from Sweden also suggests that it is now much less likely that parents will be honest with their children about their origins, defeating the whole point of the policy<sup>3</sup>.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4397249.stm">BBC News.

                    <p>A reduction in the number of donors will not force couples overseas. Firstly, most couples will trust their own health system much more than foreign ones with fewer safeguards, so they won’t want to go abroad. Secondly, seeking a donor abroad is a much more expensive business; whilst a British donor is paid just £250 pounds ‘compensation’, a Spanish donor will receive up to €900. The extra cost is passed on to the donor-seeking couples <sup>1</sup>. As such, most people are simply unable to go overseas, even if they felt they had a better chance of conception by doing so.</p><p>Furthermore, even if it were the case that more couples look overseas, this isn’t a reason to abandon the policy of transparency at home. As more and more governments see the wisdom of this policy and lift anonymity, fertility tourism will become pointless anyway.</p><p>1.&nbsp;BBC News, 2011</p>        </div>

Having gone out of their way to provide a means for a couple to have the child they otherwise could not have had, they deserve their wishes to be respected in return. The unveiling of their identity and, likely, contact from the child would cause psychological harm at least equal to that of the offspring<sup>1</sup>. There should be no hierarchy regarding whose rights are more important, disclosure should only be permitted if both parties are happy to do so. In the United States, for example, when signing up with donor banks, donors are able to 'make it clear' they don't want to be found by signing a waiver of anonymity<sup>2</sup>. If donors wish to sign that form and retain their privacy, that right should not be taken from them, regardless of the child's wishes. Donors should be entitled to move on with their lives and not fear being tracked by offspring they neither asked for, nor wanted<sup>3</sup>.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/apr/05/comment.law">Berlins, M.

                    <p>The right to privacy of a sperm or egg donor is less fundamental than that of the child's right to know, therefore the donor's desire for anonymity is overridden by the child's desire to know who their actual parents are<sup>1</sup>. To deny to a child the name of one of their parents, when it is available and on record, is to discriminate between children based on whether they were conceived naturally or not. Many parents, if given a choice, would choose to remain anonymous after one-night-stands, or accidental pregnancies, however since they are given no right to privacy, why is it that granted to donors? What is shared between both cases is the superiority of the child's rights and an understanding that regardless of the circumstances in which they were conceived, they deserve an equality of rights which remain paramount. One of those rights is the right to know who their biological parents are.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/9602162?story_id=E1_JGDNTGN">The Economist. (2007, August 2).
