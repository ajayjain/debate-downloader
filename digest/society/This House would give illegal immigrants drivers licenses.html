    <h1 class="print-title">This House would give illegal immigrants drivers licenses</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>In 2007, Eliot Spitzer, Governor of New York proposed that all illegal immigrants in his state should be allowed to obtain drivers licenses<a href="/print/17850#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. At the time, it was estimated that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 illegal immigrants were residing in New York state<a href="/print/17850#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, most of them driving on the roads despite a lack of a driver’s license. Spitzer proposed that instead of needing an American Social Security number to get a driver’s license, New York would also accept a foreign passport as adequate identification to obtain a license<a href="/print/17850#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>.</p><p>The move for giving illegal immigrants licenses is an issue that has arisen and re-arisen multiple times, especially in states with high illegal immigrant populations such as California<a href="/print/17850#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. However, American citizens are seemingly overwhelmingly against this policy<a href="/print/17850#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> with over 70% of New Yorkers polling against this policy<a href="/print/17850#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>. This creates a debate over what the impact of these licenses will be and how the public’s perception of this policy weighs up against these potential benefits. Currently, seven states in the US allow illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses: Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington<a href="/print/17850#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>.</p><div><a href="/print/17850#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> "Immigration: Let them drive." <em>Economist</em> 25 Oct 2007, n. pag.

                    <p>It is very unlikely that illegal immigrants will even opt into this scheme. Illegal immigrants are notoriously paranoid about going to the state for any form of assistance as they are afraid of deportation. The vast majority of them would rather risk getting caught driving without a license then they would risk going to the state as an illegal to receive a license in the first place.</p>        </div>

Each appears reasonable on its face, but none holds up under scrutiny.</li>

<dd>Myth 1: Illegal aliens are going to drive no matter what so issuing them licenses will improve the safety of our roads by ensuring that they have passed a driving test and purchased automobile insurance.</dd>
<dd>In 2004, automobile accidents resulted in about 42,000 deaths and more than 100,000 injuries in the United States. The vast majority of the people involved in these accidents were licenses, insured drivers, so the correlation asserted by the advocates is tenuous at best. Moreover, most illegal aliens are low-wage workers who send a significant portion of their earnings to their home countries in the form of remittances. They have little incentive to spend their wages on car insurance, and even less incentive to wait for the police to arrive after an accident, since contact with law enforcement authorities could result in deportation. Finally, this suggestion that we just accept the inevitability of illegal aliens&rsquo; presence in the United States and treat them as lawful residents undermines our belief in law and fairness. No one would suggest that we not lock our doors because burglars are going to break in anyway.</dd>

                    <p>Insurance is a key component in making the streets safe for all drivers on the road. Allowing illegal immigrants to get driver’s licenses allows them to gain driver’s insurance.</p><p>Driving absent insurance means that there is an incentive to drive off if you cause an accident to avoid having to pay for the damages you have caused and being criminally punished for driving without insurance. This leaves the other driver having to foot their own bill for the repairs to their vehicles<a href="/print/17850#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. &nbsp;Moreover, even if the uninsured driver stays at the scene, illegal immigrants are characteristically very poor as they must engage in exploitative work to make a wage because they must hide from the state and do not get the same protections from the state, so would still be unable to pay for the damages they have caused. Moreover, having uninsured drivers on the road increases insurance premiums for all insured drivers on the road, as they have to de-facto pay for the risk and damage these uninsured drivers cause<a href="/print/17850#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.</p><p>Therefore, offering illegal immigrants driver’s licenses allows for more fair and accountable systems of insurance and driving conditions on the road.</p><div><a href="/print/17850#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Confessore, Nicholas, and Danny Hakim.

                    <p>This is a marginal impact at best. The vast majority of illegal immigrants will try to flee the scene of a crash because they would be worried that the police might be called in to investigate the crash and find out they are illegal and therefore deport them. Although this isn’t always a realistic expectation, it is an expectation that most people in the illegal immigrant community have because of their paranoia over the state pursuing them and wanting to deport them. This fear is only exacerbated by the anti-illegal immigrant rhetoric that permeates American society at present and makes them feel that the state will try to seek them out however they can to get rid of them.</p>        </div>

Wired Magazine. October 04, 2007&nbsp;- &quot;New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer loves a fight. But his policy to allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver&#39;s licenses, announced just weeks ago, has even his closest loyalists in a sweat. His reasoning is that denying immigrants the legal right to drive hasn&#39;t stopped them from driving. After all, they&#39;re already breaking the law just by being here. By driving illegally, they don&#39;t have insurance, which has contributed to more hit-and-run accidents as well as higher insurance premiums for everyone else.&quot;</li>

December 12, 2007&nbsp;- &quot;The last real benefit of the policy change is the most obvious; safer streets. We all remember taking driver ed, the signs, parallel parking, three point turns, the works. Obviously, people who do not have to pass that rigorous rite of passage known as &#39;the driving test&#39; aren&#39;t going to be well equipped to handle driving on congested roads. Not knowing the rules of the road aside, the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that unlicensed drivers are five times more likely to be involved in a fatal accident than validly licensed drivers. Clearly, safer roads would also be good for everybody.&quot;</li>

I don&#39;t think that one can jump to that conclusion. If they are violating the law by being in this country, why assume that they will comply with state ordinances that require drivers to carry auto insurance? Furthermore, how are they obtaining license plates for their vehicles without proof of insurance? Unfortunately, lacking national identity cards, drivers licenses serve a multitude of identification functions; therefore, there should be reasonable limits placed on their issuance.&quot;</p>

<li>Illegal immigrants should not be integrated into American society, but rather deported.&nbsp;The primary basis for this argument is that illegal immigrants are, inherently, in the United States illegally. On a purely legal basis, they should not be afforded legal documentation such as a driver&#39;s license, and should be deported.

                    <p>There is a very big difference between rewarding people for breaking the law and taking positive action to prevent them being exploited and financially marginalised. The United States’ legal system supposedly exists to protect everyone resident within its borders – not just individuals possessing citizenship. Giving illegal immigrants basic access to very rudimentary things such as the driver’s education does not reward law-breaking or undermine the rule of law. Even if side opposition disagree with granting illegal immigrants any rights, this argument is still defeated by the beneficial consequences of ensuring that a much larger number of drivers have received training on the rules of the road. Under the resolution, America’s highways and cities will generally safer for both pedestrians and other drivers.</p><p>On the point of deterrence, there are already very large deterrents to trying to immigrate illegally. The trek is long, dangerous and controlled by violent groups on either side of the border. Bandits and people smugglers engage in robberies and people trafficking on the Mexican side; extremist groups such as the minutemen attempt to assault or shoot immigrants in transit from the American side. Not being able to get a driver’s license once here is not in any way a deterrent that holds any weight when put in context.</p><p>Being able to drive is a necessary skill in the US, where under-investment in public transport infrastructure has led to workers developing a dependence on private transport. The weak bargaining position of an immigrant seeking work would be completely undermined if she were unwilling to drive for or to her job. Even the most risk averse migrant labourer accepts that the possibility of being caught driving without a licence is a risk that they have no choice but to take.</p>        </div>

This will only engender more hate and discrimination against these communities.</p><p>Therefore, this will seriously harm the Hispanic-American community by fuelling hatred against them in the American majority.</p><div><a href="/print/17850#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> "Immigration: Let them drive." <em>Economist</em> 25 Oct 2007, n. pag.

                    <p>The state should never allow mob mentality to govern its policies and specifically should never let prejudice of its people allow the state to let exploitation and abuse of human beings go unaddressed. This resentment and assumption that all Hispanics are illegal immigrants leeching from the state is something that is already a perception that permeates US thought. This policy will at worst marginally increase that sentiment, and even if it does, the state has a duty to ignore blind hate and not let it drive state policy.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Allowing illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses is a security issue for America.</p><p>Illegal immigrants are a threat to the US because they have not gone through the necessary background checks that all immigrants are supposed to go through before being allowed into the US to ensure that they are not going to harm American citizens.</p><p>Giving illegal immigrants documents that- as proposition argument three says- could grant them access to state services and to a wider range of private services is dangerous<a href="/print/17850#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. There is no way for frontline state and business staff to determine whether drivers licence holders are migrants who have undergone appropriate police screening, or criminals with a history of dishonest or exploitative behaviour. The resolution may, therefore, allow disreputable individuals to falsely claim to be normalised American citizens.</p><p>Alternatively, and more likely, the resolution will undermine the value and utility of state drivers licences – for Latin-American US citizens at the very least. As it becomes known that immigrants from the south bearing licences might be more likely to be dishonest, banks, stores and hospitals will become less willing to accept drivers licences as conclusive proof of a Latin-American individual’s identity.</p><p>If the degree to which service providers will trust a driving licence is reduced, the improvements to illegal immigrants’ quality of life that the resolution brings about will be short lived. Moreover, legally resident Latin-Americans will find that their lives become much more difficult. Service providers will adopt a stance of suspicion toward Latin-American individuals, assuming that a Latino-American’s driving licence offers no useful indication as to his immigration status and background.&nbsp;Therefore, this policy constitutes a large security threat to America and its citizens, and a significant danger to the integration and lifestyles of thousands of Latino-American individuals.</p><div><a href="/print/17850#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> "Position Paper: No Drivers Licenses for Illegal Aliens." <em>News Blaze</em>.

                    <p>The first problem with this argument is that it assumes that illegal immigrants are easily identifiable without a driver’s license. It is not like illegal immigrants walk around with a giant red sign that says “Potential Security Threat” at present, and that when we give them licenses they will finally get to put down their signs.</p><p>On this basis, the security risk presented by this policy is minimal. Moreover, for what security risk might exist, it is very easily mitigated or gotten rid of all together. For example, if identification is needed for access to something that is vulnerable to security threat, it is very easy for the government or relevant officials to say that the only sufficient form of ID is a passport instead of a license, due to the risk people may pose.</p><p>The additional harms identified by side opposition are the result of service providers’ discriminatory practices. Federal and state race equality laws prevent businesses and government employees from refusing service to individuals based on their physical characteristics or ethnicity. Therefore, official discrimination cannot exist. At best, this will simply be soft discrimination.</p>        </div>

<p><strong>Counterargument</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Argument:_Offering_illegal_immigrants_drivers_licenses_is_a_national_security_threat" title=" Offering illegal immigrants drivers licenses is a national security threat">Offering illegal immigrants drivers licenses is a national security threat</a>&nbsp;- Many terrorists, including 9/11 terrorists, obtained driver&#39;s licenses as a means to perform their acts of terrorism. They used driver&#39;s licenses to move more freely around the United States, and to get onto the airplanes that were used in the 9/11 attacks. Driver&#39;s licenses, therefore, are a primary tool for terrorists or any individual that may pose a national security threat of some kind. While illegal immigrants should not generally be viewed as terrorists or national security threats, the poor background information on them, that they are foreign in origin, and that they illegally crossed a national boundary may make them more likely terrorists suspects than other groups. This should lead America to the conclusion that offering illegal immigrants driver&#39;s licenses poses national security risk</p>
