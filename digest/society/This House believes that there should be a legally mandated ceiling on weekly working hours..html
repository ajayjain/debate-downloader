    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes that there should be a legally mandated ceiling on weekly working hours.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Working time regulations are legal restrictions on the amount of time an employee can work for an employer without breaking the law.&nbsp; This debate focuses on the costs and benefits to imposing such a policy for an economy &ndash; benefits such as more people employed on a headcount basis,&nbsp; lower workplace related medical issues, increased productivity and lower incidence of employer abuse of employees and costs such as tendency towards automation, outsourcing and policing.</p>
<p>Currently working hours per week are disparate around the globe<sup>1</sup> &ndash; US (33.8) Germany (35.5) China (44) Canada (36.4) UK (37) Greece (42.4) South Korea (46.6) France (38) Singapore (46) Spain (39.2) Iceland (41.1) Italy (38.3.) and the correlation between hours worked and GDP/per capita income is hard to discern due to the different regions historical economic overhang and resource base. One would hardly say that Iceland is an economic powerhouse compared to the USA, though it works longer hours - but Iceland has geothermal energy, fish and banana exports, whereas the US has every type of resource known to man and is the breadbasket of the Americas, if not the world. Clearly, the resources to be worked on are a large factor at play. No amount of extra work will bring an Iceland up to a USA&rsquo;s standards of living or productivity. That said, there is good reason to believe that individual nation&rsquo;s resources can be maximised through better working arrangements. Would nations be better off if they worked each worker fewer hours?&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Human beings require downtime in the form of sleep and rest in order to maintain their peak functioning. Long working hours cut into this rest and sleep time and therefore reduce their effectiveness as workers. A cap on the amount of work that people do per week allows for proper rest periods. Tired workers are prone to making mistakes, one of the mistakes they can make is to think they can skip necessary sleep with no ill effects. "While some people may like to believe that they can train their bodies to not require as much sleep as they once did this belief is false"<sup>1</sup></p><p>A mandatory cap on the hours they work removes the decision from them and avoids this problem.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1690">Sarah</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span><a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1690"> Ledoux – “The effects of sleep deprivation on brain and behaviour” Biology 202 Bryn Mawr College 01/03/2008</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>According to the CIA World Factbook, non-industrialised countries have an average of 30% unemployment and industrialised nations have somewhere between 4-12% unemployment<sup>1</sup>. Underemployment is considered to be even higher, though precise figures are by their very nature impossible to acquire. By capping the working hours of those in employment, the unemployed stand an increased chance of entering the workforce.</p><p>With no option but to hire more staff, businesses will have no choice but to hire the currently out of work to fulfil their labour requirements. This is economically beneficial, as the costs of long term unemployment to an economy are enormous. In industrialised countries the unemployed are already being paid via taxes, with this change there can be at least some productivity from them.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/world/unemployment_rate.html"> "World unemployment figures by country" The Cia World Factbook, July 12th, 2011 </a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p>        </div>

While GDP might rise because of these actions, GDP will rise due to a fallacy of the "labour theory of value"<sup>1</sup> kind. Effort isn't in and of itself productive, though it will add to many measures of GDP. Currently displaced workers would be better served inventing new products and services for the economy they are in.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.marxist.com/marx-marxist-labour-theory-value.html"> Mick Brooks "An Introduction to The Labour Theory Of Value Part One" Marxist.com 15th Oct 2002 </a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p>        </div>

In extremis, as we can see in the “karoshi” phenomenon in Japan, people can work themselves to an early grave.<sup>2</sup></p><p>Even in less extreme examples, we can see health issues affecting productivity and causing medical problems which require paying to treat. &nbsp;The WHO estimates that work related stress costs $300bn p.a. in the US, to take one example.<sup>3</sup></p><p>It goes without saying that all this avoidable stress and medical trouble needs paying for. That the businesses themselves manage to push those costs onto wider society or the state doesn’t make those costs go anywhere from the point of view of an economy as a whole.
