    <div class="print-content"><p><strong>I. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This debate has a fairly large scope as it concerns itself with children, as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child (UNCRC), that is, &ldquo;any human being under the age of 18&rdquo; [1] and parents, whether biological, social, or legal. The proposed action is a form of parental control called &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; in all its forms whether manually (i.e. browsing Internet History), through the help of software (i.e. keystroke logs, transcripting of messages, screen capturing), or any act that acquires information about a child&rsquo;s digital activities in all intentions and circumstances, particularly whether or not the act is done under the child&rsquo;s awareness or consent. Any other parental controls such as content filtering, use restrictions, contact management, and privacy protections are not to be considered as &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; but may be discussed for the purposes of the debate. The receivers of the action are the online and mobile communications of the child which includes any information that is transmitted and received by the child through the Internet and mobile networks, made possible through computers, PDA&rsquo;s, cellphones, gaming consoles, media players, and the other digital devices. It should be noted that some of the statistics supporting some assertions are exclusive to either the U.S. or U.K. Also, while the idealized age range is &ldquo;any human beings under the age of 18&rdquo;, the age range of some statistics may fluctuate minimally but retains the relevance to the matter at hand.</p>
<p>II. Context</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the U.K. 97% of 9 to 19-year-olds use the internet on a frequency ranging from occasional to daily and 81% of the same age range own a mobile phone. At the same time, spammers, cyberbullies, and child pornographers also have access to the web and can potentially harm children. In an attempt to ward off such dangers, 1/3 of households use filtering or blocking software to monitor and regulate the Internet use of children. [2] As such, monitoring the digital activities of children would not be a completely new development and is part of ongoing debates because of its implications transcending cyber awareness, digital utility, responsible parenthood, and child privacy.</p>

                    <p>Social approval is especially craved by teens because they are beginning to shift focus from family to peers. [1] Unfortunately, some teens may resort to cyberbullying others in order to gain erroneous respect from others and eliminate competitors in order to establish superficial friendships. Over the last few years a number of cyberbullying cases have caused the tragic suicides of Tyler Clementi (2010), Megan Meier who was bullied online by a non-existent Josh Evans whom she had feelings for (2006), and Ryan Halligan (2003) among others. [2] Responsible parents need to be one step ahead because at these relevant stages, cognitive abilities are advancing, but morals are lagging behind, meaning children are morally unequipped in making informed decisions in cyberspace. [1] One important way to make this guidance more effective would be if parents chose to monitor their children&rsquo;s digital behavior by acquiring their passwords and paying close attention to their social network activity such as Facebook and chat rooms, even if it means skimming through their private messages. Applying the categorical imperative, if monitoring becomes universal, then cyberbullying will no longer be a problem in the cyberspace as the perpetrators would be quickly caught and disciplined.</p>

                    <p>While cyberbullying is indeed a danger to children, it is not an excuse to invade their personal life-worlds. The UNCRC clearly states that “(1) No child shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation,” and that, “(2) The child has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attack.” These ‘interferences’ or ‘attacks’ not only apply to third parties but to parents as well. [1] Moreover in less traditional ‘offline’ spaces children have far greater ability to choose which information they share with their parents and what they do not. As online spaces are not inherently more dangerous than those offline, it seems reasonable to suggest that similar limitations and restrictions on invasions of privacy that apply online should also apply offline. What a parent can do is to be there for their children and talk to them and support them. They should also spend time surfing the Internet together with them to discuss their issues and problems. But the child should always also have the opportunity to have his or her own protected and private space that is outside the every watchful surveilant eye of the parent..</p><p>[1] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_43110.html">United Nations Children’s Fund.

                    <p>Parents also need to monitor their children to ensure that they are properly using the time they have with the computer and the mobile phone.&nbsp; According to the Kaiser Family Foundation 40% of 8- to 18-year olds spend 54 minutes a day on social media sites.[1] and that &ldquo;when alerted to a new social networking site activity, like a new tweet or Facebook message, users take 20 to 25 minutes on average to return to the original task&rdquo; resulting to 20% lower grades. [2] Thus, parents must constantly monitor the digital activities of their children and see whether they have been maximizing the technology at their disposal in terms of researching for their homework, connecting with good friends and relatives, and many more.</p>

                    <p>Certainly parents should help their children to make most of their time with the computer and their phone. However, monitoring children in order to do so is lazy, or more precisely a form of ‘remote-control parenting’. Parents abuse of their children’s inherent right to privacy and feel that they have satisfactorily fulfilled their parental role when instead they are just lazy and unwilling to talk to their child personally about being a responsible netizen. [1] How are children to develop a healthy relationship to sharing information and privacy protection if they are constantly being surveilled by their own parents? More effective parents would instead choose to personally and positively teach their children about time management.</p><p>[1] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www3.law.columbia.edu/hrlr/hrlr_journal/42.3/Shmueli_Blecher.pdf">Shmueli, Benjamin, and Ayelet Blecher-Prigat. “Privacy for Children.” Columbia Human Rights Review.&nbsp; Rev. 759 (2010-2011): 760-795.

                    <p>A 2005 study by the London School of Economics found that &ldquo;while 57 per cent of the over-nines had seen porn online, only 16 per cent of parents knew.&rdquo; [1] That number is almost certain to have increased. In addition sexting has also become prevalent as research from the UK suggests &ldquo;over a third (38%) [of] under 18&rsquo;s have received an offensive or distressing sexual image via text or email.&rdquo; [2] This is dangerous because this digital reality extends to the real world. [3] W.L. Marshall says that early exposure to pornography may incite children to act out sexually against other children and may shape their sexual attitudes negatively, manifesting as insensitivity towards women and undervaluing monogamy.&nbsp; Only with monitoring can parents have absolute certainy of what their children are doing on the Internet. It may not allow them to prevent children from viewing pornography completely, but regulating the digital use of their children in such a way does not have to limit their digital freedoms or human rights.</p>

                    <p>Indeed it is important to consider that children do not receive or send sexually disturbing media. However, as proposition has already stated parents are much less likely to be digitally savvy than their children. Should they wish to learn children are likely to be able to penetrate any elaborate digital monitoring set by a parent. As it is, Defcon, one of the world’s largest hacker conventions, is already training 8- to 16-year olds to hack in a controlled environment. [1] That pornography is so widely available and so desirable is the product of a culture the glorifies sexuality and erotic human interaction. The effects on childrens well-being are by no means clear, indeed it can be argued that much of what parents are no able to communicate to their children in the way of sexual education is communicated to them through Internet pornography. While this brings with it all manner of problems, aside from the outrage of their parents there is little scientific data to suggest that mere exposure to pornography is causing wide-scale harm to children. Instead, it may be that many of the ‘objects’ of these debates on the rights of children are themselves quite a bit more mature than the debates would suggest..</p><p>[1] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/23/us-cybersecurity-kid-hackers-idUSTRE75M8BF20110623">Finkle, Jim. “Exclusive: Forget Spy Kids, try kiddie hacker conference.” <em>Reuters</em>.

                    <p>Parents who are willing to monitor their children&rsquo;s digital communications also benefit themselves. By setting up the necessary software and apps to secure their children&rsquo;s online growth, parents familiarize themselves with basic digital skills and keep up with the latest in social media. As it stands there is a need to raise digital awareness among most parents. Sonia Livingston and Magdalena Bober in their extensive survey of the cyber experience of UK children and their parents report that &ldquo;among parents only 1 in 3 know how to set up an email account, and only a fifth or fewer are able to set up a filter, remove a virus, download music or fix a problem.&rdquo; [1] Parents becoming more digitally involved as a result of their children provides the added benefit of increasing the number of mature netizens so encouraging norms of good behavior online.</p>

                    <p>While it is certainly beneficial for parents to immerse themselves in the digital world, it may not be good for them to be partially and informally educated by simple monitoring. Especially for parents who are not already familiar with the internet, monitoring may simply condition them to a culture of cyberstalking and being excessively in control of the digital behavior of their children. As it is, a number of children have abandoned Facebook because they feel that their parents are cyberstalking them. [1] Besides, there are other ways of educating oneself regarding ICT which include comprehensive online and video tutorials and library books that may cater to an unfamiliar parent&rsquo;s questions about the digital world.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;Children have as much right to privacy as any adult. Unfortunately there is yet to be a provision on the protection of privacy in either the United States Constitution or the Bill of Rights, though the Supreme Court states that the concept of privacy rooted within the framework of the Constitution. [1] This ambiguity causes confusion among parents regarding the concept of child privacy. Many maintain that privacy should be administered to a child as a privilege, not a right. [2] Fortunately, the UNCRC clearly states that &ldquo;No child shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation,&rdquo; [3] making child privacy an automatic right. Just as children should receive privacy in the real world, so too should they in the digital world. Individual rights, including right to privacy, shape intrafamilial relationships because they initiate individuality and independence. [1]</p>

                    <p>The individual right to privacy must certainly encompass the digital realm as proposition says. It is also undeniable that individual privacy enhances individuality and independence. However, this privacy can and should be regulated lest parents leave children &lsquo;abandoned&rsquo; to their rights. [1] &ldquo;One cannot compare reading a child&rsquo;s journal to accessing his or her conversations online or through text messages,&rdquo; says Betsy Landers, the president of the National Parent-Teacher Association of the US and explains, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply modern involvement.&rdquo; [2] Thus, Hillary Clinton argues, &ldquo;children should be granted rights, but in a stage-by-stage manner that accords with and pays attention to their physical and mental development and capacities.&rdquo; [1] Applying this principle, children should be given digital privacy to an equitable extent and regulated whereby both conditions depend upon the maturity of the child.</p>

                    <p>The proposition substitutes the good, old-fashioned way of teaching children how to be responsible, with invasions of their privacy, so violating an inherent rights [1]. Such parenting is called remote-control parenting. Parents who monitor their children&rsquo;s digital behavior feel that they satisfactorily fulfil their parental role when in fact they are being lazy and uninvolved in the growth of their child. Children, especially the youngest, are &ldquo;dependent upon their parents and require an intense and intimate relationship with their parents to satisfy their physical and emotional needs.&rdquo; This is called a psychological attachment theory. Responsible parents would instead spend more time with their children teaching them about information management, when to and when not to disclose information, and interaction management, when to and when not to interact with others. [2] That parents have the ability to track their children is true, but doing so is not necessarily likely to make them better adults [3]. The key is for parents and children to talk regularly about the experiences of the child online. This is a process that cannot be substituted by parental monitoring.</p>

                    <p>Opposition claims that monitoring is &lsquo;laziness&rsquo;. Admittedly, monitoring makes digital parenting more efficient and comprehensive. But, such technology makes parenting practical, not &lsquo;lazy&rsquo;. As it is, many people blame technology for their own shortcomings. [1] Thus, parents need to know that monitoring will not do all the work for them. It is not lazy to monitor your children, it is clearly essential that children are monitored when involved in activities such as sports. The internet is a dangerous environment just as the sports field is and should have similar adult supervision.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;Monitoring would be extremely tedious and time-consuming. Many teens send over 100 texts a day, it would clearly be very time consuming to read them all along with all other digital communication.[1] By contrast content filtering, contact management, and privacy protection parental controls, which can be used to block all incoming and outgoing information, require only minimal supervision. Parents who meanwhile deem their children immature when it comes to social networking and gaming can instead impose user restrictions on the relevant websites and devices. [2] Administering these alternative parental controls leave for more quality time with children. In this case, only when children acquire sufficient digital maturity and responsibility can these controls be lifted. As they have learnt to be mature in the digital environment the children would most likely continue to surf safely even when the parental controls are lifted.</p>

                    <p>While it is practical to use these parental controls, it is not always realistic to set such limited parameters to the digital freedom of children. Children need to understand that they have the capacity to breach their parents&rsquo; trust. [1] This not only allows a child to understand how to interact sensibly with the internet, but to experience taking an initiative to actually obey parents in surfing only safe sites. Selectively restricting a child&rsquo;s digital freedom does not help in this case. Thus, monitoring is the only way for children to experience digital freedom in such a way that they too are both closely guided and free to do as they wish. Moreover, this is also self-contradictory because opposition claimed that children are capable of circumvention which children would be much more likely to do when blocked from accessing websites than simply monitored.</p>

                    <p>If children are being monitored, or if it seems to children that they are being monitored, they would immediately lose trust in their parents. As trust is reciprocal, children will also learn not to trust others. This will result in their difficulty in forging human connections, thereby straining their psychosocial growth. For them to learn how to trust therefore, children must know that they can break their parents&rsquo; trust (as said by the proposition before). This will allow them to understand, obey, and respect their parents on their own initiative, allowing them to respect others in the same manner as well. [1] This growth would only be possible if parents refuse this proposition and instead choose to educate their children how to be responsible beforehand.</p>

                    <p>It is true that trust is a cornerstone of relationships. Admittedly, the act of monitoring may initially stimulate feelings of distrust which are particularly destructive in relationships. But nonetheless, trust is earned, not granted. The only proactive way to gauge how much trust and responsibility to give a child in the digital world is monitoring. By monitoring a child, parents come to assess the initial capability of the child in digital responsibility and ultimately the level of trust and the level of responsibility he or she deserves and to be assigned subsequently. Ideally, the initial level of monitoring and follow-through should be maximum in order to make clear to the child that he is being guided. Only when a child proves himself and grows in digital maturity can monitoring and follow-through be gradually minimized and finally lifted. [1]</p>
