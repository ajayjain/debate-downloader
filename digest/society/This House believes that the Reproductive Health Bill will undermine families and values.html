    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes that the Reproductive Health Bill will undermine families and values</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>To describe the political progress of the Reproductive Health Bill through the parliament of the Philippines as tortuous would be an understatement. However, after a decade of wrangling and political manoeuvring, a bill making contraception and family planning advice available from government health centres, as well as effective medical treatment for women who have had abortions or miscarriages and a place for family planning classes on the national curriculum, has become law. <a href="/print/46668#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p>
<p>In the ten years since it was initially proposed, the Catholic Church has used its considerable political muscle (80% of the population are Catholic) to make every possible argument against the measure. However, in the words of one of the bill&rsquo;s supporters, &ldquo;At the end of the day, those who opposed the Bill just ran out of arguments, because you can see the stark reality in the Philippines: women need to be given a choice about how they create and run their families.&rdquo;<a href="/print/46668#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a></p>
<p>Even after the bill had completed its passage through parliament, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) remained defiant. Writing on the CBCP website, Father Melvin Castro, said that the government clearly wanted to destroy &ldquo;the traditional Filipino values of family and life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fr. Castro added, &ldquo;This government has revealed its true face. It has never been for the welfare of families, women and children.&rdquo;<a href="/print/46668#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a></p>
<p>Proponents of the bill source their inspiration from somewhat less theoretical sources, Ramon San Pascual, former Executive Director of the Philippines Legislators&rsquo; Committee on Population and Development said &ldquo;You see the need for change every day staring you in the eyes: Poor, young urban girls carry their malnourished babies while the religious leaders pontificate on the evil of reproductive health education.<a href="/print/46668#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Catholic Church carries huge political clout in the country and has threatened to encourage civil disobedience to continue its fight. It has already been challenged in the supreme court in a petition that said the bill &ldquo;mocks the nation&rsquo;s Filipino culture&mdash;noble and lofty in its values and holdings on life, motherhood and family.&rdquo;<a href="/print/46668#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a> It seems unlikely that their efforts will be successful as a clear majority of public opinion support the legislation.<a href="/print/46668#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a> However, it seems likely that the debate will continue at least for the remaining three years of Aquinos&rsquo;s term of office.</p>
<p>Socrates B. Villegas, Archbishop of Lingayun-Dugupan, speaking for the Bishops&rsquo; Conference condemned the decision as corrupt, saying that the money spent on contraceptives could be better spent on healthcare and education for the poor, which would have a far greater effect on their quality of life<a href="/print/46668#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a>. Bishop Socrates&rsquo; statement certainly implies that the church will return to this issue in future elections.</p>
<p>The National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) estimates one fourth of the population can be described as impoverished<a href="/print/46668#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[viii]</a>. Many believe that contraception, both directly and indirectly through allowing the greater employment and education of women, is the single largest element of alleviating poverty around the world<a href="/print/46668#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[ix]</a>. The Catholic Church argues that contraception is a sin and, in the words of Villegas, &ldquo;As we your bishops have said in the past a contraceptive mentality is the mother of an abortion mentality&rdquo;. The Act also allows for the treatment of those women who have had an abortion, nay involvement with abortion is a mortal sin and can result in excommunication<a href="/print/46668#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[x]</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debaters&rsquo; Note</p>
<p>Debates such as this are difficult as the two sides approach the issue with different standards of proof. In this case, were the proposition to rely upon standard Catholic teaching, there would be no room for debate at all and no need for them to extrapolate their arguments beyond demonstrating that contraception is condemned by the Church and, it is claimed, scripture. This distinction is made as the references to contraception in doctrine are explicit (&sect;2370) whereas those from scripture must be inferred.</p>
<p>However, a debate that ran along the lines of &ldquo;The doctrine of the church is inviolable and must be obeyed&rdquo;, &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t&rdquo; would be far from satisfying and, ultimately, futile. As a result, these notes have touched on biblical and moral arguments but leave dogmatic assertion alone. There is certainly no doubt that this bill flies in the face of Catholic orthodoxy.</p>
<p>However, the argument put forward by the CBCP allows debaters more fertile territory and are also introduced here. However, the evidence is fairly overwhelming that giving women control over their reproductive cycles is a huge issue with regards to poverty reduction; it is however, debatable &ndash; in the literal meaning of the word - as to whether this bill will prove more efficacious in that regard than the other measures suggested by the Filipino Church.</p>

                    <p>The population of the Philippines are overwhelmingly Catholic, it seems reasonable to accept that many, if not most, accept the teaching of the Church that safe sex is married sex. Appropriate sexual relations between husband and wife can lead to a fulfilling family life including children.</p>
<p>However, freely available contraception leads to a rise in premarital sex with the rises in unwanted pregnancies that go along with that. In the US, women having premarital sex increased from 2% in 1920 to 75% in 1999, a period that saw a massive increase in the availability of contraception<a href="/print/46668#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>.. This runs against the teaching of the Church, which, itself, is one of the cornerstones of Filipino culture.</p>
<p>The first Mass was celebrated in 1521 and by the early 1600s, Catholicism was unquestionably the countries&rsquo; dominant creed<a href="/print/46668#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>. The teaching of the Church on this issue is absolutely clear &ndash; and for four centuries those have been the values of the Filipino people. This bill undermines that understanding, it will lead to an increase in pre-marital sex with devastating consequences for, particularly, the young people of the archipelago<a href="/print/46668#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a>. There is a reason why the Church argues against contraception and those values &ndash; that sex should take place within marriage, are deeply ingrained in the Filipino way of life.</p>

<p>Constitution of the Philippines. Article III (Bill of Rights). Section Five. The start of this clause is older and is almost identical to that of the US constitution. The last two sentences were added subsequently and seem to reinforce the point.</p>
<p align="center">Section 5. No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights.</p>

                    <p>This has been an urban and political obsession from the outset. The idea that the hungry and homeless need condoms more than food and shelter is clearly absurd. The poor would be better helped through &ldquo;accessible education, better hospitals and lesser government corruption.&rdquo;<a href="/print/46668#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> Rather than interfering in the moral life of the nation, parliamentarians would be better exercised in tackling these concerns.</p>
<p>This issue has consumed political energy for over a decade and received massive national and international attention and yet there are far more pressing concerns for the nation &ndash; and its political leaders.</p>
<p>Instead this bill, which carries the marks of both political and moral corruption has been the main focus of the president and congress. At the very least this suggests a questionable sense of priority, at worst a gross lack of interest in the welfare of the Filipino people.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the most important values in the Philippines are social harmony and respect for the family.<a href="/print/46668#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> The Reproductive Health bill undermines both. Allowing contraception will take away a psychological barrier that prevents pre-marital or casual sex and once that barrier is crossed the individual will have higher sexual activity.<a href="/print/46668#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> In the Philippines this will mean greater numbers of teen pregnancies and pregnancies out of marriage because abortion will remain illegal.</p>
<p>In terms of politics these values mean support for democracy but also being against corruption and graft.<a href="/print/46668#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a> Obviously the bill has been very politically divisive so undermining social harmony but also to pass this bill many parliamentarians had to be bribed so undermining this social harmony. The Reproductive Health bill represents the worst excesses of the pork barrel buffet. With a single-mindedness of purpose, the presidential palace has put everything on the table to shore up the votes required in parliament. Legislators, who had previously voted against the legislation, often repeatedly, where threatened with the loss of programmes in their constituencies if they failed to back the project, which has been at the heart of the presidential agenda<a href="/print/46668#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a>.</p>

                    <p>It should be remembered that other values within the 1987 constitution include ecological balance and the recognition of the role of women,<a href="/print/46668#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> both of which are advanced by giving women access to birth control. Pork barrel politics is an all too real tradition of Filipino politics, it is hardly unique to this bill. The fact that its use lead to the implementation of a policy that enjoys popular support is difficult to square with the somewhat wild claims of the Church about corruption. The CBCP has also been fairly free on allegations in this regard but very, very short on proof. The amount of political pressure required had more to do with calming fears of the Catholic establishment intervening directly in elections than with the views of the people.</p>

                    <p>Both sides of this debate have spoken about the need to respect the rights and lives of women. It is, however, difficult to see how exactly opponents of the legislation reconcile this with their actions. Decades&rsquo; worth of research demonstrates that educational, health and nutritional levels all fall once a family outgrows its means. In the slums of Manila that research is unnecessary as it is all too apparent at a glance. However the research is there<a href="/print/46668#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> to provide grisly commentary to the narrative folding out on the streets.</p>
<p>Investigations on a personal, national and global level demonstrate that effective family planning is at the heart of eradicating poverty<a href="/print/46668#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>. When families have less children they are more able to afford better education for those they do have and have a greater incentive to do so as they need their child to be able to support them when they are retired.<a href="/print/46668#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a> Proposition is keen that this money should have been spent on eradicating poverty &ndash; they fail to realise, deliberately or otherwise, that that is exactly what it is being spent on.</p>

                    <p>Even the doctrines of the Church accepts that pregnancy is not, in and of itself, a virtue &ndash; there is no compulsion to maximise the number of pregnancies; there is simply a disagreement about how they should be avoided. The Church recommends that couples may minimise the chance without ever making it impossible through a chemical or physical barrier.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world a pregnancy, even one that is not planned, is seen as a time for joy &ndash; a blessing for the family that will lead to a new and happy life bringing pleasure to both parents, their society and the child. That ideal is very far from the experience of much of the world where a child is another mouth to feed on impossibly little income. For all too much of the world, that life will be cruel, nasty and short. In slums, favellas and barren wastes that life is likely to be one marked more by dysentery or diarrhea, malnutrition and misery than by the sanitised, idealised image promoted in the West. That is, of course, not to say that children everywhere cannot be a cause for joy, of course they can. Indeed even within the poorest of situations, a new child can be the focus of great joy in an otherwise hard life.</p>
<p>However, if that is to be the case, that child must be planned and prepared for. Overwhelmingly, the mother is likely to have paramount responsibility for the child; so that planning and preparation needs to be theirs. It is difficult to imagine the scenario that would reach the objective observer to reach the conclusion that the right group of individuals to reach that decision were a group of celibate men who had never met the parents and would take to role in the care or support of the child. Yet that, astonishingly, is what Proposition would like us to believe.</p>
