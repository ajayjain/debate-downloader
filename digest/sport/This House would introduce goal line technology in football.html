    <h1 class="print-title">This House would introduce goal line technology in football</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>At the moment, FIFA does not permit goal-line technology (GLT) or video replays during matches, although it is permitted for post-match disciplinary measures. In a 1970 meeting of the International Football Association Board, FIFA &quot;request[ed] the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee&quot;. Yet despite this, controversy rages over the so-called &lsquo;ghost&rsquo;-goals that are all too frequent in the current game. However, on Wednesday 4<sup>th</sup> May, The Guardian newspaper reported that FIFA is set to consider the possibility of introducing goal-line technology in time for the 2012-13 season.<sup>1</sup> It is not the first time FIFA has requested that companies undergo a formal testing procedure but there is one key difference this time: they will be permitted to do so at a stadium of their own choosing. Previously, every one of the dozen or so companies who underwent the tests at FIFA House had fallen foul of the short set-up time and unrealistic conditions that were imposed there. There will be a number of strict criteria to satisfy in the two rounds of testing. Technologies must demonstrate a minimum of 90% accuracy in recognising whether both a static or a moving ball is across the line. Technologies must also inform the referee about goal-line incidents with both a vibration and a display signal to his watch, wherever he is on the pitch. The testing will be carried out under both daylight and floodlight conditions. The news will be welcomed by UK companies such as Hawk-Eye and Goalminder, who are convinced that their products are already 100% accurate. This announcement, coupled with FIFAs previously unrelenting stance on GLT, has re-ignited the technology debate. Should GLT be introduced to global football?</p>

                    <p>In other sports there is just one question: was the ball in or out? Was the player safe or out? In football, the issue would not be that simple. Not only would the GLT-operative have to consider whether the ball was wholly over the line or not, but they would also have to look at the build up to ensure that the goal was legitimate. Was there a foul? An offside? As in the notorious case of the 2010 World Cup Qualifier Play-off France v Ireland, was there a handball? This would not only be extremely time-consuming and thus detract from the spectacle of the game, but could also be potentially endless. In cricket or tennis this delay is more natural as matches are expected to take several hours; one of the hallmarks of football is it’s frenetic pace. Challenges could not be limited in an attempt to prevent this, because if a team were to run out and a blatant wrong decision were noticed they would be in the same position as they are now; GLT would have achieved nothing.</p>        </div>

This would further increase the gap that is emerging between local clubs and high-revenue leagues such as the Premier League, La Liga, the Bundesliga and Serie A.</p><p align="left">Further, currently amateur teams playing on Sundays play the same game, with the same rules and ethos, as the professionals. With GLT, many argue that this would no longer be the case. In a press conference in March 2010, FIFA president Sepp Blatter wrote: "One of the main objectives of FIFA is to protect the universality of the game of association football... If you are coaching a group of teenagers in any small town around the world, they will be playing with the same rules as the professional players they see on TV."<sup>1</sup></p><p>For example, the FA Cup has 4 or 5 qualifying rounds consisting of amateur and semi-professional knock-out phases because the Premier League teams with GLT capability are introduced. This could mean that games are run according to different rules at different stages of the same competition (and, indeed, possible even the same round if some clubs draw Premier League teams and others are small-club affairs).</p><p><sup>1&nbsp;</sup><a href="http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/FIUFA-president-Sepp-Blatter-Goal-line-technology-would-have-wrecked-football-and-been-too-expensive-article351959.html#ixzz1NG5pMb5M">Blatter: Goal-line technology would have wrecked football and been too expensive, Mirrorfootball, 11<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;March 2010,&nbsp;accessed 24/05/11</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>It is a fallacy to say that if GLT cannot be applied to all levels of football it should not be applied at all.

                    <p>Football is moving into the twenty-first century, yet the refusal to embrace GLT is completely out-dated. Nowhere in FIFA policy does it state that referees cannot use the influence of technology. In FIFAs disciplinary code (2009), Article 72 states that: 1) "During matches, disciplinary decisions are taken by the referee", and 2) "These decisions are final"<sup>1</sup>. The referee already "acts on the advice of the assistant referees regarding incidents that he has not seen" and can change decisions based on advice<sup>2</sup>. All referees also have an earpiece (introduced in 2006) linking the two assistant refs and the fourth official, which already demonstrates technology's successful impact in football. GLT is simply the next step.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/50/02/75/disco_2009_en.pdf"> FIFA Disciplinary Code 2009 edition, FIFA, December 2008, p.41, (accessed 24/05/11)</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf"> Laws of the Game 2010/11, FIFA, p.22, (accessed 24/05/11) </a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Football has operated successfully for over 100 years without GLT. Two assistant referees were introduced in 1891, 28 years after the rules of association football were coined; a fourth official was introduced in 1991; and FIFA recently introduced two additional assistant referees in Europa League games. Football has demonstrated that it is willing and capable to adjust to the demands of wider exposure without having to resort to GLT.</p>        </div>

                    <p>GLT technology is readily available and could be quickly implemented. Hawkeye, used in tennis and cricket, would serve the GLT purpose very well. Though eventually dismissed, it was suggested that GPS technology could measure whether players are offside or not. Cameras are already set up for television with enough angles to make decisions; it would be simple to set up monitors pitch-side so that officials could watch replayed footage. Currently, viewers watching at home are able to make much more informed decisions than match officials.</p>        </div>

Some people suggest that the money would be better spent improving existing official options, such as improving refereeing academies.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Technology has been proven to work across a wide range of sports from tennis, cricket and rugby. A survey of its implementation in the 2011 Australian Open demonstrates the impact that guaranteeing correct decisions had on several games.<sup>1</sup> It has become a natural aid to sport. GLT would only be used on a goal decision, much like tennis uses challenges only once a rally has stopped.<br>Football is no more fluid a sport than any of the others. If a debatable goal were scored, play would stop anyway while one team celebrates and the other protests to the officials.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.tennislife.com/articles/australian-open/494-hawk-eye-big-impact-at-crucial-moments"> Kelvin Goodchild, Hawk-eye: Big Impact at Crucial Moments, TennisLife Magazine, 29th January 2011, (accessed 25/05/11)</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Goals are the ultimate measure of success in football; technology would reduce the risk of teams losing matches unfairly due to controversial decisions (see FIFA World Cup Quarter Final 2010 England v Germany). There is no reason to expose referees to criticism, threats and derision when we have the means to help them. GLT is a tool meant to assist referees in their decisions, not undermine them.</p><p>Howard Webb has added his voice to the pro-technology debate: "anything that makes my job easier, that makes me more credible, I've an open mind to. We are still using human opinion in those decisions and maybe on a matter of fact like the goal-line some technology might be the way forward. I personally prefer it when there is no debate about the referees. It's a difficult position, [to judge over the line]. It's at speed, and it ain't easy. Sometimes I feel in a less than privileged position by not having the opportunity [to use technology] but that's where we are. It's for other people to decide where that argument goes."<sup>1</sup></p><p>Currently, referees are condemned for making honest mistakes when they have not done anything deliberately wrong. There will always be human error when subjective decisions must be made; this cannot be eradicated but we have a responsibility to minimise the risk. GLT may not change many games but its focus is about consistency and quality assurance.<br><sup>1</sup>: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1310623/Howard-Webb-calls-goalline-technology-World-Cup-final-referee-returns-Barclays-Premier-League-duty.html"> Ian Ladyman, Howard Webb calls for goalline technology as World Cup final referee returns to Barclays Premier League duty, MailOnline, 10th September 2010, (accessed 24/05/11)</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Controversy will always be a part of the game; because laws must be interpreted by an individual, fouls will always be called on the basis of opinion, even if that is someone re-watching the incident on a monitor. If fans accepted mistakes as exactly that, they would cease to matter; the authority of the referee would be absolute and the game would move on without undue mention. GLT is unnecessary.</p><div>Sepp Blatter famously argued that "Fans love to debate any given incident in a game. It is part of the human nature of our sport"1. Supporters love to hate the referee; it provides them with a scapegoat for defeat. With GLT, the authority of referees would be irrevocably diminished. They would become merely cogs in a mechanic process of decision making.

Early in the 2009/10 season Crystal Palace had a goal ruled out against Bristol City after it had actually gone in the net and bounced out.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;They lost two points because neither the referee nor the assistant referee saw the ball go in the net, and if Palace had not beaten Sheffield Wednesday on the final day of the season, they would have been relegated because of it.
