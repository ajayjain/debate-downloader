    <div class="print-content"><p>The term child performer includes young singers, actors, dancers, gymnasts, etc. These children are exceptions to the 1973 Convention concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment, and so may be paid for their work, as long as they have permits that &ldquo;limit the number of hours during which and prescribe the conditions in which employment or work is allowed&rdquo;.<a href="/print/17579#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> However, some feel that child performers ought not to be such an exception, and that it should be ensured that no child under the minimum age for admission to employment be allowed to partake in paid work of any kind.</p>
<p>Currently, child performers are protected by various laws, for example laws which dictate how many hours the child may work and how much education they must receive (both of which vary by country), or how much of their pay must be reserved for the child themselves (e.g., Canada&rsquo;s &ldquo;Coogan Law&rdquo;). Yet some believe these laws do not provide adequate protection, and that these child performers represent a group (and a group which is on the increase)<a href="/print/17579#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> whose rights are being undermined. A subset believes that the only way to protect these children completely is to ban child performers outright.</p>

                    <p>Children are generally considered to be too young to make important decisions for themselves, and so decision-making falls to parents, teachers, etc. For child performers, there are additional decision-makers: their agents. Since agents benefit financially from the child’s getting a role or doing well in a sporting event, there is a definite risk of exploitation. Exploitation can also come from parents, as in the famous case of American television child stars Jackie Coogan and Gary Coleman, who both sued their parents for spending the money they had earned as children<a href="/print/17579#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a><a href="/print/17579#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> or of Macaulay Culkin, who blocked his parents from having access to his earnings.</p><p><a href="/print/17579#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RIMqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bVYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6565,159772&amp;hl=en">AP, ‘The Kid’ To Get $126,000 For His Share’</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span></p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17579#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/277117/FORMER-CHILD-STAR-WINS-13-MILLION-JUDGMENT.html">The Deseret News, ‘Former Child Star Wins $1.3 Million Judgment’</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

Additionally, laws exist to prevent parents from spending their child’s wages; for example, the “Coogan Law” dictates that parents in California must open a trust account for their child in which 15% of that child’s earnings must be put aside.<a href="/print/17579#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[2]</a></p><p><a href="/print/17579#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Sand, ‘Child performers working in the entertainment industry around the world’.</p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17579#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.sag.org/content/coogan-law">Screen Actors Guild, ‘Coogan Law’</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Even experienced adults can find it difficult to deal with stage fright or performance anxiety. Children, more emotionally vulnerable than adults by nature, should not be exposed to this sort of pressure. This is especially true in situations where the child is being paid for their performance, since the added necessity to perform well can lead to even more pressure. Although suicide among children is rare, it is believed often to occur as a result of the child feeling like she is under too much pressure, or failing to meet the expectations of others.<a href="/print/17579#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>There are also consequences that continue long past the child has stopped performing; former child actors often have the problem as young adults as feeling as having already ‘peaked’ and find themselves without a sense of drive or ambition or a coherent adult identity, consequentially they often suffer from substance abuse and addiction</p><p><a href="/print/17579#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/mar/18/schools.uk8">Lipsett, ‘Stress driving pupils to suicide, says union’</a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Children will always feel pressure in certain areas of their lives, whether with exams or school plays. It may be true that pressure is greater for child performers, but children who perform at a professional level are generally more skilled, and so they are often better at dealing with this pressure.

                    <p>Children involved at a professional level in sports are at a higher risk than their peers of physical problems like breaking bones. In some cases, these physical problems can be fatal; e.g., Julissa Gomez, who died from complications of a vaulting injury contracted when she was 15 in warm-ups for a gymnastics competition.<a href="/print/17579#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Even in careers like acting and dancing there are risks for child performers. Actors and dancers are usually encouraged to stay thin, often to an unhealthy degree. Because children are particularly vulnerable, they are more susceptible to the perils of over-exercising for athletes and eating disorders for performers. It has been found, for example, that girls who dance in their childhood are more likely than their peers to develop anorexia nervosa in later life.<a href="/print/17579#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Lena Zavaroni, the childhood winner of ‘opportunity knocks’ in the 1970’s, struggled with eating disorders for all of her life and died aged 34.&nbsp;</p><p>With the damage eating disorders can do to a person’s body, it should be illegal to expose children to such risks.</p><p><a href="/print/17579#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q9c0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aW4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4960,3376448&amp;dq=julissa+gomez&amp;hl=en">Hoffman, ‘Obituaries’</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span></p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17579#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4121221.stm">BBC News, ‘Anorexia linked to child dancers’</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The added risk for most child athletes and performers is very low, and there is professional help in place for them to manage it.</p><p>Children who compete professionally in sporting events are only exposed to real risk in very rare, extreme situations. Some elements of risk exist in all aspects of life: children who are allowed to play on rollerblades are slightly more at risk of injury than those who are not; children who live in cities are at more risk of traffic accidents than those who live in the countryside, who are at more risk of falling out of trees, etc. Adults and children alike make decisions in which they take risks in the name of the greater benefits. For children who play a sport professionally, the physical training they receive can build strength and muscle and increase fitness levels, which provide the child with improved health and protection from injury in future. If child performers were banned, there would be no way of making sure that any children who still ended up in the business (i.e., illegally) had access to the support staff (e.g., physiotherapists, nutritionists) currently available.<a href="/print/17579#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>When it comes to the possibility of eating disorders in child performers, professionals also exist for the prevention thereof.

                    <p>Child performers are exposed to a much higher level of responsibility than their peers, without the maturity to deal with it. They may be exposed to sex, drugs, or alcohol, in a context too far removed from a normal life that they don’t learn adequate coping mechanisms. It is no surprise that many child performers “burn out” by the time they reach adulthood, often experiencing problems long before, as in the case of actress Drew Barrymore, who entered rehab at the age of 13.<a href="/print/17579#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Children should not be encouraged to enter into these adult worlds of acting, modeling, dancing, etc.&nbsp; Michael Jackson attributed his obsession with children and childhood as a consequence of having missed out on a childhood himself.</p><p><a href="/print/17579#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Barrymore, Little Girl Lost</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Cases like Drew Barrymore’s are rare, and many young performers have happy and successful careers. All young people are likely to be exposed to adult experiences at some point in their childhood, and it should be left to parents and teachers to educate children of the dangers of alcohol, drugs, etc., no matter what activities the child takes part in outside of school or the home. For many of the areas that involve child performers, there are also laws in place to ensure children are not exposed to age-inappropriate situations. For example, in North America and other countries laws exist to ensure children in the entertainment industry are not “put at risk physically (no dangerous stunts),” “exposed to morally compromising situations,” or ever allowed to “be nude or partially nude,” or “be engaged in overt sexual acts”.<a href="/print/17579#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a></p><p><a href="/print/17579#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/27201">Moore, ‘Protecting Child Stars: Laws and Regulations’</a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>In some films or television shows, child actors are absolutely necessary in order to realistically portray society and the roles children play. The incredibly popular Harry Potter films, for example, would not have been half as convincing without the large cast of actors under the age of 18 playing the schoolchildren. Child actors are also necessary in the advertising industry, in order to make products appealing to a younger audience. Some sports, too, would be endangered if children were not allowed to compete.

For example, it is easier for Latin American baseball players to sign with U.S. Major League teams if the teams think they are young.
