    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes major league baseball should continue to allow collisions at home plate.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Major League Baseball (MLB), often referred to as &ldquo;America&rsquo;s national pastime,&rdquo; differs from some other team sports&mdash;such as American football, rugby, and ice hockey&mdash;in largely seeking to avoid forceful physical contact between players.&nbsp; The rules of baseball largely prohibit players from attempting to crash into or otherwise physically incapacitate opponents.&nbsp; There is, however, one notable exception: collisions at home plate.</p>
<p>These collisions occur when a runner attempts to score by reaching home plate before the catcher (the defensive player responsible for covering home) receives a throw from elsewhere on the field and tags the runner out.&nbsp; A catcher is permitted to block the path of the runner trying to score if the catcher has the baseball in his possession or if he is about to receive a throw.&nbsp; (Otherwise, the catcher may not block home plate.)&nbsp; Runners, in turn, are permitted to collide with the catcher in order to reach home plate, or to jar the ball loose from the catcher&rsquo;s possession; either of those outcomes would allow the runner to score.</p>
<p>Catchers wear protective gear, including a chest protector, helmet, and shin guards (though they tend to remove their face mask when receiving throws, supposedly because it limits their range of vision).&nbsp; Runners have only a helmet, though they tend to be running at top speed at the time of a collision, whereas the catcher is stationary and sometimes is unable to observe the runner&rsquo;s approach because his attention is focused on receiving the throw.</p>
<p>These collisions at home plate have occasionally resulted in serious injury.&nbsp; When injuries occur, they are usually&mdash;though not always&mdash;to the catcher.&nbsp; Famously, Hall of Fame player Pete Rose barrelled into catcher Ray Fosse in the 1970 All Star Game.&nbsp; Fosse was injured and was never the same player again, but the collision allowed Rose to score the winning run.&nbsp; More recently, in May 2011, the San Francisco Giants&rsquo; star catcher Buster Posey suffered a gruesome, season-ending leg injury when he was hit by Scott Cousins of the Florida Marlins.&nbsp; Cousins scored, helping the Marlins win the game.&nbsp; But the images of Posey&rsquo;s injury sparked a debate about whether such collisions should be permitted.</p>
<p>Those who oppose crashes differ in precisely how they would change the rules, but the most common proposal is to require the runner to slide, just as they must do when attempting to reach other bases.&nbsp; Another option is to disallow catchers to block runners&rsquo; paths.&nbsp; Most of the arguments in this debate do not depend on the specific proposal.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Baseball is a form of entertainment, and few plays are as entertaining as bang-bang plays (a close call on whether the runner is thrown out) at the plate.&nbsp; As a sport that&rsquo;s often criticized for being too slow and boring&mdash;&ldquo;baseball has no clock,&rdquo; the saying goes<a href="/print/18174#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&mdash;it&rsquo;s important that it hold onto perhaps the most dramatic, vivid play it has to offer.&nbsp; One columnist described it this way: &ldquo;When [collisions] do occur, they&rsquo;re exciting. &nbsp;We watch to see how well the catcher blocks the plate, how hard the runner slides, and whether the catcher can hold the ball. &nbsp;As dangerous as that play may be, it&rsquo;s exciting to watch.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>Other sports&mdash;like American football, ice hockey, and rugby&mdash;feature plenty of violent hits.&nbsp; Baseball has so few of them that when they do happen, they are doubly entertaining.&nbsp; It is just not necessary for baseball to prohibit a small dose of something that is extremely common in other sports.</p>

                    <p><strong>Collisions are often not entertaining, and when they are, it&rsquo;s for the wrong reasons.</strong>&nbsp; Most collisions do not show two athletes engaged in a skilled showdown; they feature athletes awkwardly trying to achieve their goal (scoring or getting the out) without injuring themselves.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not fun or exciting.</p>
<p>Fans also tend to be horrified by the injuries they witness in these crashes.&nbsp; Watching Buster Posey&rsquo;s leg snap at an odd angle was hardly entertaining or amusing; it was stomach-turning.</p>
<p>And if fans do find this sort of thing entertaining, they&rsquo;re wrong to do so.&nbsp; Violence should not be glorified, at least not in this sport.&nbsp; Nobody should delight in watching baseball players put their careers in jeopardy.&nbsp; Baseball is fundamentally different from other sports; if people want to see athletes impose harmful blows on each other, they can watch boxing or ice hockey or ultimate fighting.</p>

                    <p>First, collisions are part of the tradition of baseball.&nbsp; They have been part of the game for a very long time.&nbsp; Fans, players, and managers all expect home plate hits to occur from time to time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some things are part of the game. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s not a whole lot you can do,&rdquo; said Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek, who has been on the receiving end of numerous crashes in his career.<a href="/print/18174#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp; Varitek&rsquo;s manager at the time, Terry Francona, agreed: &ldquo;Nobody wants to see anybody get hurt, but you got to play the game.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp; And former catcher Brad Ausmus, who had also been hit multiple times in his career, echoed the sentiment: &ldquo;[I]t&#39;s part of the game.&hellip; &nbsp;When you put on the shin guards and chest protector, you know that if there&rsquo;s a play at the plate and you&rsquo;re blocking the plate, you could take a hit at any moment.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>&nbsp; As the Associated Press put it, many people believe &ldquo;home plate collisions are as much a part of baseball tradition as peanuts and Cracker Jacks and the seventh-inning stretch.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p>
<p>Second, home plate hits are an essential element of playing the game hard.&nbsp; Without them, baseball would be much less deserving of its nickname &ldquo;hardball.&rdquo;&nbsp; One commentator notes, &ldquo;[An injury is] extremely unfortunate, but it&#39;s the result of a hard-nosed play that is as old as the game itself. &nbsp;To take away the potential for a high-intensity, physical play in an otherwise non-physical sport would be a mistake.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>&nbsp; In that vein, collisions are also part of the dynamic between the offense and defense that, once removed, will make the game much poorer: &ldquo;A baserunner wants to get there at all costs, whereas a catcher wants to protect it at all costs. &nbsp;The mutual discomfort that&#39;s evoked in both the catcher and the baserunner as a play at the plate develops is one of the intriguing peculiarities that makes the game of baseball so great.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></p>

                    <p><strong>Collisions are much less a part of the game than people believe.</strong>&nbsp; The notion that collisions have been in the game for ages is a widely held misconception.&nbsp; In fact, collisions were specifically banned in baseball&rsquo;s early history, and the collisions we see today came about only since around the late 1960s.&nbsp; Bill James, one of the best-respected authorities on baseball, wrote: &ldquo;Basepath obstruction was a major problem in the 1880s and nineties, when baseball was in danger of becoming a contact sport. &nbsp;In 1897 the rules on obstruction were tightened up, and the principle of free access to the bases met with general acceptance at the other three positions. &nbsp;There was always something of a problem with catchers blocking the plate, but there were always limits....&nbsp; I think it has changed a lot just in the last fifteen or twenty years. . . . I don&rsquo;t remember [well-respected catchers] Elston Howard or Bill Freehan doing some of the things that [catchers] do now [in the 1980s].&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Clearly, collisions are not a necessary part of the balance between offense and defense.&nbsp; Baseball did quite well for decades without allowing runners to crash into catchers.&nbsp; Just because something is now erroneously regarded as a &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; does not make it deserving of respect.&nbsp; Toughness in baseball is better measured by playing hard every day, rather than by meaningless, destructive collisions.</p>

                    <p>Some hits lead to injury, but the vast majority do not.&nbsp; One commentator challenged proponents of a rule change &ldquo;to name as many as five MLB catchers in the last 30 years who have had their careers ended or shortened as a result of a home plate collision. &nbsp;Personally, I can&rsquo;t think of one.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp; In posing some&mdash;though not a substantial&mdash;risk, home plate collisions are very much like other aspects of the sport.&nbsp; Every time a pitcher throws a pitch, the batter could get struck and hurt.&nbsp; Every time two outfielders converge on a fly ball, there&rsquo;s a risk of injury.&nbsp; Baseball, as with many other sports, inherently involves the risk of injury.&nbsp; It makes little sense to focus on this play, which doesn&rsquo;t often result in significant injury.</p>
<p>Moreover, catchers are trained to position their bodies in ways that minimize the injury risk from crashes.<a href="/print/18174#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp; If catchers do as they&rsquo;re trained, they&rsquo;re very unlikely to get hurt.</p>

                    <p><strong>Collisions increase the risk of injury dramatically.</strong>&nbsp; Though it&rsquo;s true that most collisions do not result in significant injury, they result in a higher rate of injury than almost any other baseball play.&nbsp; And just because a collision doesn&rsquo;t necessarily result in an injury that derails a player&rsquo;s entire career does not mean that it didn&rsquo;t take a toll.&nbsp; This is especially true now that we&rsquo;re learning more about concussions, which might be suffered without someone immediately realizing it.&nbsp; After a catcher on his team suffered a concussion in a collision, Yankees manager Joe Girardi referred to this type of injury as &ldquo;so unpredictable.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so scary....&nbsp; You just don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen&rdquo; with a concussion.<a href="/print/18174#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>When catchers are trained to block the plate, they&rsquo;re taught how to reduce the risk of injury, not how to eliminate the risk of injury.&nbsp; No matter how a catcher positions himself, there will still be a risk of injury, and it will still be much higher than for any other play in baseball.</p>

                    <p>There are two often-discussed ways to change the rules: require the runner to slide, just as they must do when attempting to reach other bases; or disallow catchers to block runners&rsquo; paths.&nbsp; Each results in an imbalance between the catcher and runner.&nbsp; A commentator describes this dynamic very well:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Major League Baseball was to employ a rule stating that runners must avoid contact with the catcher&mdash;similar to the &lsquo;slide or avoid&rsquo; rule employed in amateur baseball&mdash;it would give the advantage to the catcher. &nbsp;The catcher would have the benefit of dictating the course of action that a baserunner must take, and would&mdash;perhaps more importantly&mdash;have peace of mind knowing that there is no chance of an ensuing collision.&nbsp; If Major League Baseball was to make a rule stating that the catcher cannot block the plate, the advantage would certainly go to the baserunner, who would enjoy the luxury of a straight path to the most sacred ground on a baseball diamond.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>Ray Fosse and Buster Posey (mentioned above in the Introduction) are just two examples of players who suffered major injuries in crashes at home plate.&nbsp; Texas Rangers star Josh Hamilton, reigning Most Valuable Player of the American League, broke his arm when he collided with a catcher in 2011.&nbsp; In August 2010, Cleveland Indians catcher Carlos Santana suffered a season-ending knee injury when he was hit by Red Sox runner Ryan Kalish. &nbsp;To go back a few more seasons, Braves catcher Greg Olson was having a career year in 1992 until Ken Caminiti broke his leg in a collision.&nbsp; There have been literally dozens of severe injuries suffered in bang-bang plays at the plate.</p>
<p>This high rate of injury should come as no surprise, given the physics involved in this type of play.&nbsp; A simulation with a crash-test dummy wired with sensors showed that a catcher can get hit by a runner travelling 18 miles per hour, resulting in 3,200 pounds of force&mdash;much worse than an American football hit, with much less padding.<a href="/print/18174#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Teams make heavy investments in their players, paying them millions of dollars a year.&nbsp; Thus, serious injuries are very expensive, both because of the treatment required and because the player is missing many games.&nbsp; This is why the Oakland Athletics instructed their top catcher, Kurt Suzuki, to avoid blocking the plate&mdash;because their investment in him is worth more than whatever runs he allows by failing to stop the runner from scoring.<a href="/print/18174#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>When players are injured in these plays, it&rsquo;s also bad for fans, who will lose the opportunity to see their favourite athletes on the field.&nbsp; As Bruce Bochy, Busty Posey&rsquo;s manager with the Giants, told the media after he lost his star catcher to injury: &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a guy that&rsquo;s very popular in baseball. &nbsp;Fans want to see him play, and now he&rsquo;s out for a while.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>

                    <p><strong>Collisions are not as dangerous as they&rsquo;re made out to be.</strong>&nbsp; (Proposition Argument #3 is directly relevant here, though it&rsquo;s not repeated in this cell.)&nbsp; People remember vivid example of injuries in home-plate crashes, but that does not mean that they happen as often as people believe.&nbsp; This is a textbook example of the availability heuristic: people believing that an event is much more likely because they can think of an example of it very easily.<a href="/print/18174#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp; Yes, those injuries were quite bad, but it was their very severity that leads people to overestimate the frequency and severity of home-plate collisions in general.</p>
<p>Any simulation of a hit at home plate will be imperfect.&nbsp; In a game situation, a runner will have to make a split-second decision of whether to slide around the catcher or to barrel into him, and this will often reduce his speed or remove the decisiveness of his impact.&nbsp; The catcher is also wearing protective pads.&nbsp; The crash-test dummy does not accurately represent reality.</p>
<p>If a team does not want its catchers to be involved in collisions, it can instruct them to avoid collisions, just as the Oakland Athletics did.&nbsp; This is their choice; they have decided that the risk is not worth it.&nbsp; But this is not a reason for MLB to step in and change the rules.</p>
<p>Fans want to see players playing their hardest.&nbsp; A player is much less exciting to watch if he&rsquo;s always worried first and foremost about whether a particular action is going to injure him.&nbsp; Yes, there&rsquo;s always a risk of injury, but fans understand that, and they still want to see collisions and players giving their all.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>A clean hit will not heighten tensions between teams.</strong>&nbsp; Players recognize when a collision is &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; and when it is entirely within the rules and spirit of the game.&nbsp; After the Posey hit, a baseball columnist summed up &ldquo;the consensus viewpoint&rdquo; of baseball professionals and journalists: &ldquo;It was a clean play.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>In the 2011 playoffs, Texas Rangers Mike Napoli was barrelled over by Sean Rodriguez of the Los Angeles Angels.&nbsp; Napoli said afterward, &ldquo;It was a fine, clean play.&nbsp; He was trying to score. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to try to do the same thing if I&rsquo;m trying to score and a guy is blocking the plate in that moment.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18174#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp; As long as a player is not intending to hurt another and does not use unnecessary force, players on both teams are unlikely to hold grudges.</p>
<p>The threat of retaliation for &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; hits is actually a useful deterrent to gratuitous force.&nbsp; Players are much less likely to hurt each other if they know that there will be consequences for that behaviour.</p>
