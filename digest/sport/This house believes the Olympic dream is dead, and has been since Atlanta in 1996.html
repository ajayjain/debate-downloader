    <h1 class="print-title">This house believes the Olympic dream is dead, and has been since Atlanta in 1996</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the Modern Olympic Movement, developed in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century a set of universal principles &ndash; or values &ndash; that, he intended, encompassed all Olympic Games: respect, excellence and friendship (London 2012). His principles were born out of the International Olympic Committees motto of &lsquo;Citius, Altius, Fortius&rsquo; &ndash; faster, higher, stronger&nbsp;(Allen, 2011). The values were intended to apply to all competing athletes but eventually permeate into society and education.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 1996 in Atlanta, an Olympics marred by the growth of corporate sponsorship, a bombing that gave the event a political edge and a widespread belief that, even if they were not caught, doping was rife among athletes. Each of the following Olympics has followed a similar path, away from the ideals of de Coubertin and the values that have ensured the longevity of the event. Proponents argue drugs now overshadow remarkable performances, the voting process is accused of bribery and pandering to the interests of its most senior officials whilst studies indicate the youth are more uninspired by the event than ever before. Opponents of the motion maintain however that ultimately sport wins out, that the Olympic Dream is forever maintained by the application and dedication of its athletes; countries and athletes continue to flock to the event because of what it represents and that history will not be overshadowed by political posturing or drug scandals. Though the Olympic Games will continue to be the world&rsquo;s premier sporting event, the debate concerns whether the modern Olympics still carries the dream and ideals of its antecedents?&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The Olympic dream is fundamentally about the limits of human sporting achievement, who can work the hardest and prepare the most efficiently to, in effect, be the best. In the name of excellence, and the motto of ‘faster, stronger, higher’, athletes should be encouraged to do anything they possibly can to improve their performance.&nbsp; As Matthew Herper notes, ‘the absolute limits of non-enhanced human athletic performance may well be set in stone…what remains constant is the public clamor for new world records.'<sup>1</sup> As such, if the chemicals exist to take an exceptional athlete that little bit further, to permit them to do something extraordinary, they should be allowed. If an athlete is willing to give the best part of his life training for an Olympic event, and we readily congratulate such dedication, why should they be prevented from experimenting with drugs that will similarly display their dedication to being ‘faster, higher and stronger’? The only reason drugs are considered unfair currently are that they are banned and therefore not everyone is entitled to use them. If drugs were legal and accessible to all, the competition would be fair. Juan Antonio Samaranch, former head of the IOC, has advocated just this point, arguing that the rules could be changed to allow non-harmful performance-enhancing drugs&nbsp;(The Economist, 2004).<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1&nbsp;</sup><a href="http://www.forbes.com/2002/02/15/0215ped.html">Herper, M.

                    <p>The Olympics is about what is naturally possible; it is a contest between athletes, not chemical laboratories. The will and desire to push yourself to victory should come from within, not from the drugs that are increasingly permeating Olympic Games' (The Economist, 2004). The arguments against permitting performance-enhancing drugs are twofold; the first is that it harms athletes unnecessarily, permitting drugs would effectively encourage athletes to harm themselves through repeat use, and secondly that it is against the spirit of sport, namely the principles of fairness that the IOC so values. The dangers of performance-enhancing drugs are increasingly coming to light, EPO, popular among cyclists, is believed to thicken the blood to the extent that it can cause heart attacks (The Economist, 2004).</p><p>The Economist.

                    <p>Fairness as an Olympic value should go both ways; athletes are expected to train and compete in a fair manner, but the public at large must also be fair in their adjudication of the athlete's success. To suspect all Olympic medallists of the doping crimes of a few is not fair, successful athletes deserve immediate recognition and congratulations for their efforts. If they declare they are drug-free and their effort was the result of hard work and determination, their words should be respected. Pierre de Coubertin intended his set of universal principles to apply to education and society as a whole, not merely the athletes; such hopes should be recognized (London 2012).</p><p>London 2012.

                    <p>This is an idealistic suggestion, but unfortunately one that does not marry with the reality. Though only a tiny minority of athletes have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs, only a minority are ever tested and of those, only a minority of drugs can be tested for. As such, it is no surprise that the likes of Charles Yesalis, an epidemiology professor and expert on performance-enhancing drugs, believes that "a 'large percentage' of record-holders doped their way to the finish line" (Herper, 2002). Yesalis has also admitted his personal belief that drug testing, as championed by the IOC, has been a 'farce' (Herper, 2002). In such a climate, it is difficult to ask the public to view an extraordinary achievement as anything less than the result of the advantages granted by performance-enhancing drugs.</p><p>Herper, M.

                    <p>The massive commercialisation of the Games erodes the idea of taking part for its own sake: with so much sponsorship money at stake, winning at all costs is the inevitable aim. The rule of the sponsors seems more important than the sport: interrupting television coverage of the events to advertise is symptomatic of this, permitting McDonalds to sponsor a sports event is another. As is the auctioning off of 'virtually every aspect of the Games to the highest bidder.'<sup>1</sup> Whilst a recent report indicates that sport is still at the centre of the Olympics, 'the volume of commercial messages drowns out any competing narratives apart from sports' (Multinational Monitor, 2008, p.8). The Olympic Dream is that competing narrative attempting to weave the values of friendship, respect and excellence into the home viewer.</p><p>Furthermore, corporate sponsorship concentrates on the richest countries' athletes. The United States, for example, benefits from huge funding from over 100 corporations for its team and can thus train them to far higher levels than developing countries can (Multinational Monitor, 2008). As one of these 100-plus companies, Citi paid $30 million purely to be the 'official bank of the 2012 United States Olympic Team' (Belson, 2011). This prevents competition on an equal footing, one feature of the Olympic Dream.</p><p><sup>1&nbsp;</sup><a href="http://multinationalmonitor.org/editorsblog/index.php?/archives/93-The-Commercial-Games-How-Commercialism-is-Overrunning-the-Olympics.html">Multinational Monitor.

                    <p>Commercialization ensures that the Olympic Games are still "the" Games in which to compete. It is an amateur event, so by definition they are taking part for its own sake. Furthermore, a few breaks in coverage is a small price to pay for 3.5bn people to be able to see the Games, and thus be inspired to play sports: that was the number of viewers estimated for the Atlanta Games. The sponsors do not really have significant control over the running of the Games: Coca Cola's calls for IOC Chief Samaranch to be replaced were not met; IBM had to end its sponsorship of the Games because the IOC was asking for more than they could pay. The IOC has the stronger hand, and a wide choice of sponsors. Without any sponsorship, many of the poorer countries that are able at present to send a team to the Olympics would be unable to do so. Sponsorship, even a little, is the key to starting to put all countries on an equal footing.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The Olympic movement gives considerable funding to community sports programmes, precisely in order to teach fair play. Furthermore, the participation of the world's best athletes acts as an inspiration to young children, encourages physical activity, healthy eating and hard work. The Olympic Dream is present in this connection between the competing athletes and the young children watching them, believing they one day can get to the same spot. Surely watching the Games therefore can only be a good thing, since it gives young people something to aspire to, and is thereafter complimented by the Olympic legacy and support for local sports programmes. In that sense, the Olympics provides both the inspiration and the means for children to chart their own Olympic Dream.</p>        </div>

Today, the Games are played by a "Dream Team" of finely-trained athletes, the exclusivity of which can be conducive only to watching in awe, rather than copying. Furthermore, the treatment by professional tennis players and footballers of the Olympics as a second-tier tournament only encourages the youth to regard professionalism, and its money, as the ultimate goal, not sport for sport's sake.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The use of performance-enhancing drugs is&nbsp;sufficiently common in the Olympics to be a cause of concern. Not only do they reduce the victories of those who take them to meaninglessness but they cast aspersions over the efforts of all other athletes. As Simon Barnes noted in Beijing in 2008, “the world is full of people declaring that they don’t care who wins what at the Olympics, because ‘they’re all on something’”&nbsp;(Barnes, 2008).&nbsp; New drugs such as the growth hormone EPO are very difficult to detect, and the Olympic authorities are not doing enough to overcome the problem – stirring the negative public opinion. Though the IOC claims to be clamping down on the drug problem, there were still 26 cases of doping at Athens in 2004, and 20 cases in Beijing&nbsp;(Allen, 2011), such cases only indicate the athletes taking known substances, or substances that can be tested for. The Olympic motto of ‘faster, higher, stronger’ is fatally undermined if athletes’ achievements are the result not of physical and mental strain, but chemical concoction. &nbsp;</p><p><sup>1&nbsp;</sup><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/olympics/article4479308.ece">Barnes, S.

                    <p>Despite some well-publicized cases of doping in previous Olympic games, the drug-testing technology is now sufficiently advanced to deter most athletes. The evidence bears witness to this change as the proposition's statistics indicate. The IOC is coming down hard on those who take drugs: a two year ban for the first offence has been introduced. It also plans to make London 2012 the 'most tested games ever', with over 5,000 individual tests, or roughly one for every two athletes (Allen, 2011). As such, there is very little chance of a doping athlete going undetected.</p><p>Furthermore, as record-breaking athletes come under the most amount of scrutiny for doping, it is a reasonable assumption that they are least likely to risk doping.

It is possible to be faster, higher and stronger wherever and whenever the Games are held, so economic and political matters are forever detached from the Olympics in that way. Sport, when it is so extraordinary, can transcend the most depressing economic recession or political scandal. The Olympics in Beijing in 2008 was ostensibly meant to be overshadowed by the crackdown in Tibet and subsequent boycotting of the opening ceremony however politics were forgotten as soon as Usain Bolt had run his world-record 100m and 200m legs. There is little that an extraordinary sporting achievement like Bolt's sprints cannot surpass in terms of interest, this is manifestly the Olympic Dream. So long as the Olympics can create the conditions for such events that captivate the world in a manner little else can, the Olympic Dream lives on.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The Olympic Dream is not carried by the athletes, and even when it is, it is quickly and often undermined by external realities. If we take the assertion that the Olympic dream is carried by the athletes, then the widespread and systematic drug use that has permeated recent Olympic Games' is proof that they care little for values like fairness and respect for other competitors. The insatiable desire for success that drives such users is a far cry from the mutual respect and friendly competition that the Olympics once stood for. Nevertheless, the Olympic Dream is more often carried on the shoulders of the host nation, which uses the competition both to present an image of itself to the outside world and reap the rewards of worldwide exposure. China in 2008 portrayed its opening ceremony 'as a coming-out party for a modern, prosperous and increasingly influential nation' (Leibenluft, 2008). Subsequent decisions to boycott the event propelled the issue into the limelight, and permitted China to use the 'Olympics should be about sport' excuse to their advantage. As such, even if the Olympic Dream is not yet lost, it is being readily exploited.</p><p>Leibenluft, J. (2008, April 11). Passing on the Torch.

The sense of fraternity that Olympic athletes once had is becoming lost in the antagonistic rivalries between nations and individual athletes and the pressure not merely to compete, but to win. We should have some sympathy with athletes sometimes: very often, they are compelled to take drugs by their team's coach. The Chinese swimming team, for example, was beset at Atlanta by claims that they had adopted a systematic and untraceable doping regime to improve their athletes, with remarkable results.<sup>1</sup> To overcome this, the IOC Conference in February 1999 recommended that coaches should take the Olympic Oath as well as athletes, however the document itself is so tarnished by the regularity with which it is ignored that it is fast becoming a farce. The Olympics therefore may still be a great event, with many great athletes but it no longer carries the associations with respect and fair-play that made its Dream so appealing to so many.</p><p><sup>1&nbsp;</sup><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1996-02-12/sports/sp-35096_1_east-german">Almond, E.
