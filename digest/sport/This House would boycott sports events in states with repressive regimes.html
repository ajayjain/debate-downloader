    <h1 class="print-title">This House would boycott sports events in states with repressive regimes</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Sports events have often played host to gestures designed to make political points. Holding as they do worldwide media attention, they act as a platform to highlight the actions of repressive regimes. Both the 1980 Moscow Olympics and the 1984 Games in Los Angeles suffered boycotts from a range of countries protesting against the policies of the host nation. 1993, China bid for the 2000 Olympics, and its failure to win enough IOC votes then was widely linked the international concern over its use of military force to put down student protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Finally, Beijing was awarded the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in 2001. The decision delighted the Chinese government and people, who saw it as international recognition of their country&rsquo;s growing economic, sporting and political strength. Others criticised the choice of Beijing as rewarding a dictatorial government with a terrible human rights record and a history of international trouble-making.&nbsp; Proponents, including the Olympic Committee, maintain however that sports events are not the time or place to raise such issues and that they should remain about the athletes, not politics.</p>

                    <p>Hosting the Olympics, or any other global sports event, is a huge prize for any nation, giving them huge international prestige and attention, and repressive regimes do not deserve to be by being given the chance to host the games. As the most recent repressive regime to host the games china is a good example. China is a communist dictatorship which maintains tight political control over its 1.3 billion people. All power is focused in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, and those who call for the introduction of democratic elections are arrested and jailed. As the-then Senator Obama argued, &lsquo;it is past time for China to respect the human rights of the Tibetan people&rsquo; (Miller, 2008). Instead China used the games as a coming out party to show the power of the state. With the exception of the USSR in 1980, every post-war Olympics has been hosted by a democratic country and this has helped to promote democracy as a desirable norm for successful states. Many democratic countries refused to send teams to the Moscow Olympics and while countries did not feel they could do the same with China in 2008 the principle remains the same &ndash; we should not lend our support to legitimize dictatorships through sport.</p>

                    <p>Sports events are as much about the people as they are about the regimes, a boycott serves only to punish the people for their leaders&rsquo; crimes. Xujun Eberlein emailed a relative in China to ask about local reaction to calls for a boycott, to which his relative responded &lsquo;they (the boycotting states) are trying every way to find problems with China, picking bones from egg yolk&rsquo; (Eberlein, 2007). A boycott in this case would only &lsquo;fasten (the Chinese peoples&rsquo;) ties to the government&rsquo; (Eberlein, 2007).&nbsp; Repressive regimes should not be rewarded, but a boycott offers just that, &lsquo;so let&rsquo;s attend the Olympics but in ways that will call attention to Chinese complicity in genocide, in ways that will embarrass the Chinese government but not the people&rsquo; (Kristof, 2007).</p>

                    <p>When countries do not rise to the occasion offered by sports events and clean up their act they deserve to be boycotted. In the case of the 2008 games China has a terrible human rights record so in order to win the Games in 2001, China promised the IOC that it would improve its human rights record, but these promises were not kept. Thousands of political prisoners continued to suffer in Chinese jails and labour camps with a quarter of a million people imprisoned without trial. Journalists are among those detained in this way, and the regime runs a huge censorship operation covering all forms of media including the internet despite promises of unprecedented openness to the media in the run up to and during the games. Once a state has been awarded the games there is little the awarding body can do to encourage the state to keep to its promises. When a state does not improve we cannot show our approval by sending a team to the Olympics like the free world did in 1936, missing the opportunity to &lsquo;use the limelight of the Games to make an issue of Germany&rsquo;s deepening persecution of Jews&rsquo; (Tkacik Jr., 2007).</p>

                    <p>Hosting the Olympics is contributes to the opening up of repressive regimes and helps to improve human rights. This has been the case with China, just as it did twenty years ago in South Korea. Susan Brownell, who has studied the effects of the event on China, writes that the Olympics will speed up the &lsquo;formation of a civil society in urban China by as much as 5-10 years&rsquo; (US Information Service, 2007).The signs are already there; some political prisoners have been freed in the past year and the government is taking advice from countries such as Britain about improving its justice system. Already it has been announced that the usual restrictions on foreign journalists will be loosened during the Beijing Games. In any case, many of the countries which attack China and others over human rights are hardly above criticism themselves &ndash; what of America&rsquo;s record with hundreds of thousands of deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan following its invasions? What about Guantanamo Bay?</p>

                    <p>The Olympics are a celebration of international cooperation and peace. This means that they should not go to states that don&rsquo;t live up to this. China is not a responsible actor on the global stage. Many groups like the Heritage Foundation &lsquo;cautiously welcomed&rsquo; the granting of the games to China as an opportunity &lsquo;to compel Beijing to adopt true Olympic values&rsquo; but they have been left disappointed (Tkacik Jr., 2007). Its support props up dictatorial regimes in Sudan, Zimbabwe, Myanmar and North Korea, offering them loans, aid investment and military support, all of which democratic countries have decided to withhold in protest against their repressive treatment of their own people. China has also used its veto on the United Nations Security Council to prevent concerted international sanctions being applied against these rogue states. Deciding to boycott the Olympics when it is being hosted by regimes that do not uphold the values of the games, and would apply pressure both on the host and others to act more responsibly in future.</p>

                    <p>Having potential troublemakers host the Olympics will improve international peace and cooperation. These states will be unwilling to cause any problems in the years between getting the games and hosting them as they will&nbsp; want the event to show them in the best light possible. This can be shown by China&rsquo;s &ldquo;peaceful rise&rdquo; over the twenty years before hosting the games during which it avoided using military force. It has not invaded other countries without UN authorisation. Instead it is cooperating with its neighbours, both in South-East and in Central Asia, and seeking to promote a &ldquo;multi-polar&rdquo; world where no dominant state can dictate to others. China became more actively involved in seeking solutions to international problems such as Sudan and North Korea, for example by voting in August 2007 to send a UN peacekeeping force to Darfur. A successful Olympics add to these positive global contributions and do much to reinforce its constructive approach to international affairs in the future.</p>

                    <p>The sports bodies that pick athletes for the world&rsquo;s major sports events can be dictated to by their respective governments. As the sports bodies would ultimately be representing their state, not their sporting body, they need the approval of the government in question before they can compete. Furthermore, as much of the funding both the sport and their participation in the event is provided by the state, they must heed to the state&rsquo;s decision. If the government in question rules that the regime hosting the event is not deserving of the attention and credence bestowed on successful hosts, it has the ability to order its sports bodies and athletes to not travel.</p>

                    <p>States can prevent their own contingents participating, but they can&rsquo;t prevent the sports event going ahead, nor the inevitable boost to the regime&rsquo;s image that results. In so doing, the boycotting state risks coming across as not the arbiter of morality but a government unwilling to separate politics from sport and let athletes compete. Furthermore, with little evidence to suggest that boycotts have any positive benefits in terms of opening up the regime itself, there is scope to argue the opposite that competing in the event is the most effective means of reducing state repression. In Beijing in 2008 for instance, the gaze of the world&rsquo;s media ensured that state crackdowns during the games themselves were restrained to ensure that the sport remained the centrepiece.</p>

                    <p>The Olympics should be above politics and countries should not use their sportsmen and women as a stick with which to beat governments they do not approve of. The spirit of the Olympics is to bring together nations from all over the world in peace, regardless of their political systems, &lsquo;forging friendships among athletes&rsquo; (Olympics, 2009). For this reason any threat to boycott any Olympic Games would be against the Olympic charter. Such actions would also be counter-productive, as any authoritarian country is likely to react negatively to any external attempt to force it to change its system. Greater political openness is most likely to come through more engagement with the outside world, as happened in South Korea in the run-up to the 1988 Seoul Olympic where the authoritarian government &lsquo;acquiesced to popular demands for democratic election&rsquo; (Blackistone, 2007).</p>

                    <p>While it is easy to say that sports and politics should exist separately, particularly in the context of the Olympics, the reality is that the Olympics have always been politicized. The 1936, 1968 and 1972 Olympics were all politicized in a significant way. China specifically had lost a previous bid for the Olympics in part due to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, epitomising the entanglement of sport and politics (Blackistone, 2007). Even in the 2004 summer Olympics in Greece, President Bush used it as an opportunity to argue that the War on Terror had made it possible for Afghani and Iraqi athletes to compete (Blackistone, 2007). So, while it may sound appropriate to claim that the Olympics should not be politicized, the reality is that it always has been, and that there continues to be a legitimate place for it to express national and international interests.</p>

                    <p>Staying away from the Games will do nothing to help anyone who has been inconvenienced by the preparations for the Olympics including those who are forced to make way for the building of the games. Such complaints occur in every host city, including Sydney and London, as people are displaced and land compulsorily purchased for a greater public good. Host cities benefit hugely from the vast investment in improved infrastructure needed to host the Games (e.g. roads, public transport, sanitation, environmental improvement, hotels to support larger tourist numbers), and this legacy endures long after the last race has been won. A boycott would mean that all these inconveniences for the people of the host city remain but there would not be any payoff for them during the games themselves as a result of increased business.</p>

                    <p>Huge building works for the Olympics can actually make human rights even worse. In Beijing the $80 billion redevelopment of large areas of the city for the 2008 Games was carried out in a very authoritarian manner (Human Rights Watch, 2004). Many historic streets and buildings were destroyed without any thought of conservation. Over 300 000 people lost homes, businesses and land, with little or no compensation, and those who tried to complain were often jailed (Macartney, 2005). And as the Games approach police crack-downs target poor migrant workers, the homeless, the mentally ill and normal street vendors, in an effort to present a sanitised face to the world. Our attendance in any games where this happens, as athletes or as spectators, would be built upon these shattered lives.</p>

                    <p>Boycotts, far from being inappropriate, simply don&rsquo;t work as an effective form of protest. Even if a state did wish to raise the status of Tibet in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, for example, an Olympic boycott would be the wrong way to do it. A boycott would have only lead to fears in Beijing of a renewed Tibetan uprising and increased persecution.&nbsp; Despite some countries staying away from Moscow in 1980 over the USSR&rsquo;s invasion of Afghanistan, the boycott had no effect on Soviet policy other than to reinforce mistrust and cold war divisions. Nicholas Kristof argues that the &lsquo;most effective way to have an impact would be to ask athletes to pledge to wear warm-up vests that say &lsquo;Save Darfur&rsquo; and allow the stars of the events to dominate the headlines, not politicians (Kristof, 2007). Olympics are about the athletes and any use of the event for political purposes should nevertheless focus on them.</p>

                    <p>Boycotts are not an ineffective form of protest; they may not precipitate immediate change but they draw attention to a particular issue. China&rsquo;s treatment of the Tibetan people is one such issue that deserved to be brought up. Since its invasion of Tibet in 1950, The People&rsquo;s Republic has claimed it as part of China and ruthlessly suppressed attempts by the Tibetan people to call for independence or autonomy. Their Buddhist religion has been attacked and the Dalai Llama, the Tibetan people&rsquo;s traditional leader, forced into exile. Meanwhile the communist regime has settled hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese in Tibet, discriminating in their favour in order to weaken Tibet&rsquo;s ethnic and cultural identity &ndash; actions which are clearly against the Olympic Charter. China also planned to use the Olympics to assert its claim to Tibet, for example by using a Tibetan antelope as part of its five Olympic mascots. Sending a team to Beijing showed acceptance of China&rsquo;s illegal occupation of Tibet and harsh treatment of its people.</p>
