    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes the House of Lords should be reformed</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The House of Lords is seen by some as an antiquated addition to our government structure, a mockery of modern democracy and an inhibiting influence in the drive for progress. While the function of a second chamber is recognised as beneficial as it ensures checks and balances on the activity of the House of Commons, the composition of its members reflects a society long past, a reminder of a time when equality was not a social aspiration. New Labour’s first stage of reform in 1999 did some work to reduce hereditary peers in the House of Lords (now standing at 92), but since then the gradual phasing in of reforms that was proposed has failed to materialise. Many advocates of democracy and the right of law are now calling for these reforms to be completed, to abolish members of birth right and to introduce an electorally voted body to ensure that the House of Lords is as fully democratic as the rest of our country claims to be. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg presented The House of Lords Reform Draft Bill and the accompanying White Paper to Parliament on 17 May 2011. It proposed reform to a smaller, 80%-elected House with 15-year maximum terms for elected peers.<a href="/print/17763#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Whether or not this bill will be met with enthusiasm, apathy or disdain, and whether or not it will prove to the greater good for the House of Lords and government of Britain, is yet to be seen.</p><div><a href="/print/17763#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Ward, Halina, ‘House of Lords Reform, long-termism and Future Generations’, (23 May 2011) viewed on 1 June 2011 http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/2011/05/23/house-of-lords-reform-long-termism-and-future-generations/</div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>The House of Lords is undemocratic. Currently the members of the House of Lords consist of hereditary peers, senior members of the Church of England and those appointed by political parties. Whether or not there is an abuse of power or the outcome of the House of Lords is beside the point – its very existence in its current state is undemocratic and as such it should be reformed. It seems nonsensical that a country that lectures to the rest of the world the importance of democracy, to the point of war, should overlook such a grievance in their own society.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Although the House of Lords may not be a true expression of ‘democracy’, it has a positive function in the governing of the country and is based in a tradition and heritage that the people of Britain should not try and abandon. One could argue in return that those very decisions and wars that Britain is in involved in to defend ‘democracy’ do not reflect the will of the people and that modern states are not true democracies at all. In practice the British people have a limited say in how the country is run and it would be naïve to champion the idea of Britain being a ‘democracy’ by ignoring the existence of such an overpowering state machine.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Reform of the House of Lords would strengthen the legitimacy of the house and therefore improve its functions. By electing the second chamber they would gain the legitimacy to not simply stall bills but reject them all together or drafts bills of their own, thus facilitating a more dynamic government, able to change. Using a different electoral technique, for example Proportional Representation with members sitting for longer periods would allow them to still be of a different composition to the House of Commons and not sway to short-term political popularity. Electing different portions at different times would also guard against a freak landslide result affecting the house’s balance. By creating a worthy opposition to the House of Commons all issues would be debated and decided upon more fairly and government would be more closely monitored.</p>        </div>

                    <p>House of Lords reform defeats the point; firstly the election process would deter many industry experts and attract political opportunists instead, thus eliminating the current worth of the House of Lords. It likely that if elected the House of Lords would simply become a mirror for the House of Commons. By being non-elected the House of Lords is free from political sways and can work in the long-term interests of the country.</p>        </div>

                    <p>An elected House, even one elected every ten years, would still think about policies that are popular in the short term rather than the long-term welfare of the country, making it closer to the House of Commons in its interest and reducing its role as a balance. By subjecting the second chamber to election there would be two outcomes: if elected at the same time the House of Lords would simply become a mirror-image of the House of Commons rendering it pointless, if elected mid-term the composition of the House of Lords would reflect the tendency for a government to be unpopular mid-term, thus creating gridlock and making the system unworkable. Reform of the House of Lords is impractical and undesirable.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The House of Lords could be elected on a longer term basis than the House of Commons – ten years for example. Furthermore elections could be staggered during this period so the House of Lords would never simply be a ‘mirror’. Furthermore the House of Lords should be democratically elected and it should reflect the will of the people, whether or not this is a ‘mirror’ of the other house is not relevant as it reflects the results in a fair vote. Similarly if elected mid-term and the House of Lords reflected mid-term unpopularity of the ruling party, then this too would be the will of the people – any clashes would be part of the democratic process.</p>        </div>

                    <p>One should not assume that the lack of democracy is wholly negative; do the majority of people know what is best for the country? Or do industry experts? Could the public reach a consensus on important governing decisions? Government can see the bigger picture and balance the needs of different interest groups to produce the best outcome for all: ‘true’ democracy is simply unworkable and can too easily lead to the ‘tyranny of the majority’ as described by Fareed Zakaria.<a href="/print/17763#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Perhaps the best way to illustrate this point is to look at the two champions of democracy: France and America. France overturned its monarchy and government in the name of liberty, yet quickly descended into mob-rule and violence; ‘democracy’ had a bloody birth.<a href="/print/17763#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Similarly one only has to look at the appalling levels of inequality within the United States of America to question the nature and worth of ‘democracy’.<a href="/print/17763#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> So if the nature of government is not simply to fulfil notions of ‘democracy’ but to ensure good governance then the House of Lords is still an important institution.</p><div><a href="/print/17763#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Zakaria, Fareed, The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy Home and Abroad (New York, 2003)<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17763#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Doyle, William, The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2001)</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17763#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> American Political Science Association Task Force, ‘American Democracy in an Age of Rising Inequality’, Perspectives on Politics, 2 (2004)</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The fear of controversy or of an ‘unworkable’ government is not reason to stall reform. If we adopt the stance that a government knows best or if we excuse a government to override the will of its people in the name of the greater good, then we pave the way for the misuse of power. Democracy should be held in the highest regard, only free societies can be secure and developed as shown in numerous historic example.

                    <p>The AV campaign cannot be compared to reform to the House of Lords, furthermore one should not mistake a misinformed public due to political spin, with apathy. Often voters express that they are apathetic because they feel that they can’t change anything, that there vote won’t count: reform that ensures the people running the country are directly elected by the people would help to counter these feelings.</p>        </div>
