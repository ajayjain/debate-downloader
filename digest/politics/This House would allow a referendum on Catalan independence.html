    <hr class="print-hr" />
    <h1 class="print-title">This House would allow a referendum on Catalan independence</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>This debate is not a cost benefit analysis of whether Catalonia should remain within Spain as Catalonia despite how much many Catalans may wish for a vote on independence has yet to get that far. Instead for the moment the much more urgent question is whether the Catalans should get their vote on independence at all; the Catalans clearly say yes while the Spanish government and the other regions are firmly against. Once the issue of whether a referendum should be had is resolved and accepted by both sides, or the issue become less relevant by proposals of unilateral Catalan moves towards independence then this debate may become irrelevant and one about the costs and benefits of full independence much more necessary.</p>
<p>Although the pros and cons of independence are not particularly relevant to this debate the historical context for why the Catalans should want to have independence and why the Spanish state should be so against the prospect that, unlike the UK with its own secession problems over Scotland,<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a></sup> it is unwilling to allow a referendum on the issue may be of interest.</p>
<p>In the early part of the 15<sup>th</sup> Century what is now Spain was still divided politically, Catalonia was a part of the Kingdom of Aragon rather than the Kingdom of Castile. In 1479 the territories of the two kingdoms were united in a personal union through the marriage of the King of Aragon Ferdinand II and Queen of Castile Isabella. Their grandson Charles I (usually known as Charles V outside Spain as a result of being Holy Roman Emperor) became the King of both territories in 1516. However each region within the Kingdoms maintained considerable autonomy; for example taxes had to be sought through each regions cortes rather than nationally and the Catalans in particular were often unwilling to pay for what they saw as Castile&rsquo;s empire.</p>
<p>During the War of Spanish Succession Catalonia first recognised Philip V and then turned to the other claimant Archduke Charles when he entered Catalonia. Philip however won the war and kept the entirety of peninsular Spain in the Treaty of Utrecht on 1713. Having been on the losing side Catalonia had its constitution and independent political structure abolished, and its culture and language suppressed.</p>
<p>Catalan nationalism like other national identities was a result of the Renaixença of Catalan culture and literature during the 19<sup>th</sup> century however this was simply devoted to greater self government within Spain rather than independence leading to the creation of the Commonwealth of Catalonia on 6<sup>th</sup> April 1914 with the first devolution of powers back to the region of Catalonia from the Spanish state.<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a></sup> During the last days of the Spanish civil war Lluís Companys the Catalan President actually declared independence but there was never any opportunity to implement it. General Franco who won the Spanish Civil war in 1939 destroyed Catalan autonomy centralising Spain and suppressing dissent.</p>
<p>This suppression helped fuel resentment against a centralised Spanish government creating democratic movements against the dictatorship. Catalonia&rsquo;s role in the end of the Franco regime and the return to democracy created for several decades a belief that the Spanish state would allow greater autonomy so allowing a Catalan nation within Spain.<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a></sup> However in 2000 the Popular Party won a landslide and began attempts to centralise Spain along with encouraging boycotts against catalan products such as cava. While the Popular Party lost power in 2004 they were still able to force the modification of a Catalan Statute of Autonomy in the Spanish parliament and then even after the modified statute passed they challenged it in the constitutional court.<sup><sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc">4</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>The result of the court&rsquo;s decision that the statute required further modification combined with the current economic crisis has led to a spike in support for independence. On 11<sup>th</sup> September 1.5million people turned out for a Catalan independence rally in Barcelona showing the level of support for independence.<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a></sup></p>

This is enshrined in the UN Charter right at the start in Article 1 as a purpose of the United Nations &ldquo;To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples&rdquo; and is also in other major international agreements.<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a></sup> Large numbers of states have been recognised since this principle of self determination was recognised by the world in 1945 a great many of them states that are less natural states in terms of size, economy, ethnicity or geography so it would be wrong to deny a right exercised by so many others from the Catalans. It is clear that the Catalans wish to exercise this right to decide their own destiny democratically through a referendum. When polled by the Catalan Survey Institute 74.1% said they would be in favour of organising a referendum with 19.9% against, the remaining 6% were undecided.<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a></sup></p>

                    <p>It is far from clear whether self determination gives peoples the right to decide whether they should be independent. The Supreme Court of Canada has looked at this issue with reference to Quebec that has in the past argued for its right to self determination. The court argues &ldquo;The recognized sources of international law establish that the right to self-determination of a people is normally fulfilled through internal self-determination -- a people&#39;s pursuit of its political, economic, social and cultural development within the framework of an existing state. A right to external self-determination (which in this case potentially takes the form of the assertion of a right to unilateral secession) arises in only the most extreme of cases and, even then, under carefully defined circumstances.&rdquo; This is because such a right must fit in with the principle of territorial integrity of existing states.<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a></sup></p>

                    <p>For Spain by far the biggest reason for allowing a referendum is that it may well be the best way of keeping Catalonia within Spain over the long term. So long as Spain says it will not allow a referendum or give the Catalans control over their own destiny the movement for Catalan independence is likely to get stronger as it can focus on the denial of democratic rights &ndash; Spain is waving a red flag to the bull. Allow a referendum, particularly if it has to be accompanied by a long period of campaigning for reflection and Catalans will have to agonise whether it is in their own best interests,<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a></sup> decide whether they want to damage their economy by having large companies such as Planeta the world&rsquo;s largest Spanish language publishing business pulling out,<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a></sup> sever extensive links with Spain, and risk their membership of the European Union which Spain would veto.<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a></sup> If Spain were to offer as an alternative a new constitutional settlement that solves many of the grievances the Catalans have at the moment they might find they really want to remain within Spain,<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a></sup> much as many scots would prefer devo-max.</p>

                    <p>This would be a very risky course to take; currently there is 51% support for independence and that could as well go up as down when given the opportunity. With both the Spanish and Catalan economies in crisis it is likely that such a referendum would only be bolstered by anger at the government due to the state of the economy. This might therefore be an option for Spain at some point in the future when the economy is back on its feet and so less of an issue but at the moment it would be waving goodbye to Spain as we know it.</p>

                    <p>Catalonia is likely to go its own way and decide it should make its own decisions regardless of the rest of Spain&rsquo;s views. Artur Mas Catalonia&rsquo;s President says &quot;If we can go ahead with a referendum because the government authorises it, it&#39;s better. If not, we should do it anyway&quot;.<sup><a href="/print/39480#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a></sup> So regardless of the Spanish position in his next four year term he will hold a referendum asking &ldquo;Do you want Catalonia to become a new state within the European Union?&rdquo; If Spain then does not back down about allowing this then there may well be a constitutional crisis.

<p>Ultimately despite being within Spain so long as support for independence remains strong the Catalans probably have more cards to play; they provide more in taxes than they receive so could cut Madrid off, or in the final play they could unilaterally secede leaving Spain with the unpalatable option of either negotiating to get Catalonia back in, accepting, or invading.</p>
