    <h1 class="print-title">This House would lower the voting age to 16</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The right to vote is one of the most important human rights. It gives men and women the chance to have a say in the way they are governed. It allows them to get rid of bad governments and makes sure that any government listens to its people for fear of being thrown out at the next election. It is therefore one of the most important ways in which other rights (e.g. free speech, the right to a fair trial) are protected.</p>
<p>Not every country in the world is a democracy, with free elections giving citizens a fair political choice. But the right to vote is spreading and outright dictatorships are increasingly few on every continent. Yet what should that right to vote mean? A century or so ago almost no countries allowed women to vote, and it took decades of struggle for them to win political rights. Fifty years ago countries such as South Africa and many states in the USA limited the rights of black people to vote, but that too has changed for the better. Now every democracy accepts that all adult citizens should have the right to vote. But what does adult mean?</p>
<p>In almost every country adult is taken for voting purposes to mean 18. 142 countries have 18 as their voting age. Some others (such as Taiwan and Japan) do not give their young people the right to vote until they are 21. But in several countries the voting age is younger - in Korea, Sudan and Indonesia it is 17, in Brazil, Cuba and Nicaragua it is 16, and in Iran it is as low as 15. And in a number of well-known democracies such as the UK, USA and Australia there are growing movements to lower the voting age to 16. This then follows a growing trend; in Britain a backbench motion for lowing the voting age passed the UK parliament 119-46 but won&rsquo;t be implemented as it was opposed by the government,<a href="/print/54564#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> in Scotland 16 year olds will vote in the independence referendum,<a href="/print/54564#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> while Argentina has lowered the voting age for elections in 2013.<a href="/print/54564#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Within the EU Austria lowered its voting age in 2008<a href="/print/54564#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> and there have been calls for the rest of the European Union to follow suit.<a href="/print/54564#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p>
<p>This topic looks at the case for lowering the voting age to 16, but the arguments below could be used for a debate about a different voting age (perhaps 14?). Another issue to consider is whether the same age should be used for all kinds of voting (e.g. local elections, state elections, national elections, referenda). And should young people gain the right to stand for election at the same age they get the right to vote? In many countries, such as the UK and United States, you can vote at 18 but can&rsquo;t stand for elected office until you are 21.</p>

                    <p>16 year olds are mature enough to make important decisions such as voting. If the government agrees that 16 year olds can have sex, join the army, and apply for a passport, then surely they are mature and responsible enough to decide who runs their country and makes important decisions that affect them. Their bodies are fully adult, they have been educated for at least 10 years, and most of them have some experience of work as well as school. By this time, it is likely a teenager will have developed &ldquo;Advanced reasoning skills...the ability to think about multiple options and possibilities. It includes a more logical thought process and the ability to think about things hypothetically&rdquo;.<a href="/print/54564#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This means they are able to form political views and they should be allowed to put these across at election time. Indeed by 16 children are as tolerant as adults and their political skill (the perceived ability to participate effectively in civil life by writing to political leaders and by speaking publically at meetings) is as high at 16 as for those in their late twenties.<a href="/print/54564#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> There is no magic difference between 16 and 18 - indeed, many 16 year olds are more sensible than some 20 year olds.</p>

                    <p>The UK electoral commission agrees that &ldquo;there is no single definition of maturity&rdquo;<a href="/print/54564#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. However it is not the case that most 16 year olds are mature enough to vote. Rather, teenagers are emotionally immature and tend to behave as though &ldquo;they are &ldquo;on stage&rdquo; with the attention of others constantly centred upon their appearance or actions. This preoccupation stems from the fact that adolescents spend so much time thinking about and looking at themselves&rdquo;.<a href="/print/54564#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The large majority still live at home and go to school. They may have adult bodies, but their minds are still those of children who have to be protected. By 18 young people have become much more independent and are able to make their own way in the world. Their political views are likely to be more thoughtful compared to 16 year olds, who may just copy their parents&rsquo; opinions or else will pull away from their parents and as a result &ldquo;the peer group takes on a special significance... Members of the peer group often attempt to behave alike, dress alike... and participate in the same activities&rdquo;<a href="/print/54564#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>.</p>

                    <p>It is unfair to have taxation without representation. Many 16 year olds work and pay tax on their earnings just as any other worker would. Yet unlike other workers at present they are not allowed to have a say in how the government spends their money, nor in how much should be collected from them in taxes. This was famously the grievance of the thirteen colonies that sparked the American revolution. In 2011 in the UK 7.2% of 16-18 year olds were in employment but not being given fair representation.<a href="/print/54564#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Policies such as the minimum wage and working hours and conditions are also set by governments, and if young people are old enough to have jobs they should be able to have their say in these issues.</p>

                    <p>There is no age at which you start to be taxed. Rich children with investment funds and child stars all earn money at a young age and are taxed on it. This does not mean that the voting age should be lowered so that these individuals are represented. Similarly every visitor to the UK pays VAT on any goods they buy, this does not entitle them to a say in government.</p>

                    <p>There is a problem of apathy in many western countries, with low turnouts at elections. Young people are taught citizenship or civics at school with the aim of building &ldquo;<em>Knowledge and understanding about being informed citizens...Developing skills of enquiry and communication...Developing skills of participation and responsible action&rdquo;<a href="/print/54564#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><strong>[1]</strong></a></em> however they don&rsquo;t get a chance to put this knowledge into practice for several years. Is it surprising that they lose interest in public affairs during this time? Because national elections are usually only held every four years or so, many people have to wait until they are 20 or 21, years after that civic education, before their first chance to cast an important vote. It is noticeable that political interest is much higher among those in education than those who are not. In Austria it was found that 68% of 16 to 18 year olds in education were interested in politics against only 45% of those who are working.<a href="/print/54564#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> By demonstrating trust and promoting inclusion, young people would feel more confident in their views, become less disillusioned and eventually teach their children the same values. Introducing a lower voting age can only have long term benefits for the expansion of democracy.</p>

                    <p>Earlier voting is not a solution to the low turnout problem, the electoral commission in the UK concluded .here is evidence to suggest that extending the franchise will actually create lower turnout and projections about if it would get higher cannot be sufficiently determined<a href="/print/54564#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> At the moment 18-25 year olds are the least likely to cast a vote at election time. Youth membership of political parties is falling. Lowering the voting age still further is therefore likely to reduce turnout even more. Most people don&rsquo;t vote because they think the election system is unfair, their vote does not count, or because they don&rsquo;t trust any of the political parties on offer - lowering the voting age won&rsquo;t solve these problems. Instead with a generation that is increasingly online, to take the UK 21 million households (80%) had internet access in 2012<a href="/print/54564#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, and there are over 6.4 million iPhone users,<a href="/print/54564#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> the answer is therefore to engage them digitally not through trying some magic bullet at the ballot box.</p>

                    <p>There is a notable difference between how young people and the elderly are treated. Giving the vote to teenagers would force politicians to take them seriously. Policies on education (e.g. student loans) would have to take their views and interests into account for the first time. 16 year olds today are well-educated and media-savvy, so they can express informed opinions. But at the moment young people&rsquo;s views are easily ignored by those in power because they don&rsquo;t have the vote. The vote for 16-18 year olds would help redress the growing age imbalance which is occurring as a result of aging. In the rich world by 2050 one in three will be a pensioner and one in ten over 80.<a href="/print/54564#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> These voters will clearly be looking after their benefits at the expense of the young.</p>

                    <p>Since 18-24 year olds already ignore their ability to vote there is no reason to expect that 16-18 year olds will be any more interested. At the moment over 50% of 18-24 year olds don&rsquo;t vote even though they are eligible.<a href="/print/54564#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> So this kind of change is hardly going to offset aging.

                    <p>This is an odd idea; should parents not be voting for themselves not their children? If they are voting for their children rather than themselves are they not themselves disenfranchised? The fact is that children and their parents have different interests on account of the age gap that is likely to be at least 20 years. Someone who is 16 is much more interested in university fees than someone who is 40 who will be more interested in how much they will have at retirement. Furthermore with turnouts that are often less than 50% a great many children are not being represented by their parents at all. Adults have the choice to not vote, when their parents are choosing not to vote children don&rsquo;t get this opportunity.</p>

                    <p>Just because 16 year olds have the right to do some things, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that they should use them. If all 16 year olds left home at 16 and started families it would be considered a disaster. And not all rights are given at 16 - most countries have a higher age for important things such as drinking alcohol, serving on a jury, joining the military, etc. It makes sense for different rights to be gained at different times as young people mature and get used to more responsibility. The more difficult and complex the choices involved in that right and the greater the impact the later a right should be given. Because voting is so important, involves complex decision making, and can potentially have a large impact, it should be one of the last rights to be gained. It then makes sense that it voting should be granted at the time we consider adulthood to be beginning, which was agreed in the declaration of the rights of the child is 18.<a href="/print/54564#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>It would be dangerous to give young people the vote. They might use it in foolish ways. For example they will be more likely to make their decision on which party had the best image; so will vote for parties that put up celebrities. They are also more likely to vote for extremists into power or vote without thinking on single issues (e.g. making drugs legal, free university places, cheap beer!).

                    <p>Everyone would agree that there has to be a minimum voting age. Most people believe that the line should be drawn at 18 rather than 16. Although some 16 year olds may be mature enough to vote, most have not yet formed political views of their own yet. On average, young people are much more likely to be ready for the responsibility of voting at 18. There is then no reason why 16 would make a better cut off point than 18. At both ages some rights are given, at both there will be some who pay tax who are not given representation, at both some will be immature. There is no clear dividing line so there can be no clear reasoning for lowering the voting age to 16. &nbsp;</p>
