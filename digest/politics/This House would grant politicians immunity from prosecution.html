    <div class="print-content"><p>Some modern states grant politicians outright immunity from prosecution.&nbsp; In such countries, including Albania,<a href="/print/18222#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Brazil<a href="/print/18222#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> and to a lesser degree France<a href="/print/18222#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>, politicians may not be subjected to criminal prosecution while they hold office.&nbsp; Other nations, such as the United States, have mechanisms of de facto immunity for politicians, by granting the head of the executive the uncontrolled power to issue pardons, effectively making any member of their cabinet immune.&nbsp; Many other nations give no such protections to the holders of political office, beyond protection from civil claims for remarks made while in parliament.<a href="/print/18222#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p>
<p>The resolution is that politicians be granted a full and inviolate immunity from prosecution while serving.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The premier reason that most states, even those that allow for the prosecution of politicians, abstain from prosecuting them while they hold office is that being a politician is a job that requires one&rsquo;s undivided attention.&nbsp; Especially for the holders of prominent national-level offices, writing legislation, responding to crises under one&rsquo;s purview, consulting one&rsquo;s constituents, and engaging in campaign work often lead to politicians working an upwards of 12 hour day, every day.&nbsp; To expect politicians cope with all of these concerns will simultaneously constructing a defense against pending charges would be to abandon all hope of them serving their constituents effectively.&nbsp; We are rightly aggravated when politicians take extensive vacations or other extracurricular forays.<a href="/print/18222#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp; Being under indictment not only consumes even more of a politician&rsquo;s time; the stress it causes will inevitably seep into what remaining time they do allocating to fulfilling their duties, further hindering their performance.&nbsp; The impeachment proceedings for Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice were so intensive that they took tremendous resources away from not only the president himself, but all branches of the federal government for several months<a href="/print/18222#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, amidst serious domestic and foreign policy concerns such as the ongoing war in Kosovo.</p>

                    <p>Politicians have to divide their focus anyway.&nbsp; As the examples above concede, being a politician means being pulled in several different directions.&nbsp; Elections are particularly distracting, and in jurisdictions with fixed election cycles like the United States can make periods of up to a year prior to the election a write-off for getting real work done.&nbsp; Thus, personal liability is nothing special among the many concerns a politician has.&nbsp; In fact, accountability, of this direct type, and for serious offences, is probably more important than most of the things a politician is forced to consider, and at the very least deserves inclusion among them.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>By the most popular definition, a state is the entity with the monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a defined territory.&nbsp; Politicians, as the government of that state, necessarily wield the institutions of that state force.&nbsp; This results in the tremendous responsibility of deciding when the overwhelming power of the state is exercised.&nbsp; This pertains to a variety of areas, such as police action against civil unrest, the interrogation of both alleged and convicted terrorists, and economic policies that subsidize industries with state resources.&nbsp; While it is certainly possible to brazenly abuse this power, in many cases politicians are presented with options which are, if at all illegal, marginally so, and made with the good faith interest of the nation at heart.&nbsp; There are even conceivable situations in which a politician may exercise options that are clearly illegal but serve an overwhelming state interest; consider an illegal raid on a private building in order to prevent a nuclear bomb from going off.&nbsp; While documented instances of policy-makers choosing not to act for a particular reason are rare, several senior CIA officials stated that they had become risk averse merely because the idea of prosecuting officials who made security policy had entered the public discourse.<a href="/print/18222#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp; We ought to place politicians in a situation where the only factor in their decision-making process is what serves the public interest, rather than having to weigh what they consider to be the right action against the chance it will lead to their incarceration.&nbsp; Attempting to avoid this through a limited system which allowed for the prosecution of apolitical crimes but immunity for political decisions would fail to accomplish the goals of prosecution of politicians, which is primarily to protect against political abuses of state power which threaten the rights of the citizenry.</p>

                    <p>No one doubts that politicians have to make morally difficult decisions, where sometimes every option is unpleasant.&nbsp; However, no one wants politicians to have an unrestricted ability to make ethical questionable decisions.&nbsp; That is exactly what immunity would deliver them.&nbsp; A politician who knows that they cannot be touched is incentivized and licensed to be much more brazen in their behavior when in office, and we want a bulwark against unrestricted rule-breaking.&nbsp; A state of affairs wherein politicians can sometimes be prosecuted creates the ideal amount of disincentive for politicians to break rules; they will do so only when there is a pressing need, and only to a moderate degree.&nbsp; Because of the plausible justifications for such acts, politicians need not fear prosecution in the overwhelming majority of cases.&nbsp; For instance, no official from either the UK or USA has been actually indicted with regard to highly-legally-dubious programs to torture detainees<a href="/print/18222#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a><a href="/print/18222#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.&nbsp; Moreover, politicians are seldom prosecuted anyway, especially because they tend to belong to socioeconomic strata that punished less or not all compared to the rest of society.&nbsp; There is no legitimate need to give them more protection.</p>

                    <p>The obvious benefit to prosecuting politicians is that it punishes &ndash; and thereby deters &ndash; corruption by politicians.&nbsp; However, this benefit can be achieved through other means.&nbsp; Firstly, many western liberal democracies have one form or another of removing a politician from office in the midst of their term, such as impeachment in the American system or a vote of no confidence against the government in the Westminster system.&nbsp; While defenders of immunity oppose impeachment as contrary to the principles outlined above (because of the effect that it may have on political duties), this is an option that remains in cases of gross misconduct. &nbsp;&nbsp;If the political will cannot be mobilized to remove a sitting politician, they are held accountable by the electorate to whom they must answer in the next election, and who will likely punish blatant misuse of political power.&nbsp; Even if the individual politician has reached a limit on their term of office, or does not seek reelection, they are still held in check by the damage that will be done to their party in the event of major misconduct on their part.&nbsp; Finally, most politicians are significantly concerned about their legacy, which is tarnished significantly by corruption even if they are never held legally accountable for it.&nbsp; While Nixon received a full pardon from his success,<a href="/print/18222#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> his name has become synonymous with criminality and scandal: a fate most politicians wish to avoid.</p>

                    <p>These mechanisms are not immediate enough to put an immediate stop to an aberrant behavior.&nbsp; Impeachment proceedings take months at least; elections may be years away; and reputational damage is even more long-term.&nbsp; Moreover, these punishments are nowhere near a sufficient deterrent.&nbsp; If loss of one&rsquo;s job, and damage to one&rsquo;s public image were sufficient deterrents, we would not prosecute business leaders for insider trading, nor celebrities for drunk driving.&nbsp; The fact is that a criminal justice system which punishes everyone equally is not just fair; it&rsquo;s also a practical method of achieving meaningful deterrence.&nbsp; Finally, even if we are willing to settle for one of these lesser punishments, the threat of a great punishment gives prosecutors leverage to strike deals with the politicians, such as offering not to prosecute in exchange for coming forward with the details of misdeeds.</p>
