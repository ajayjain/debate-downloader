    <h1 class="print-title">This House would have no elections rather than sham elections</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Elections are the lifeblood of all democracies; they are where the people have the chance to make their choice of government, often after years where their only real influence has been through protest and the media. Yet not all countries that have elections are really democratic. Elections have become close to universal with many countries that are &lsquo;autocratic&rsquo; also having elections just like any democracy. These elections are often a sham in the sense that there is no real chance of there being a change in government as a result of the vote. Thus we might consider there to be another criteria beyond simply holding elections that determines if a country is truly democratic; whether the elections they hold are &lsquo;free and fair&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the Declaration on Free and fair Elections the Inter-Parliamentary Council set out numerous conditions for elections qualifying as free and fair including:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Voting Rights</p>
<ul>
<li>Every adult citizen has the right to vote in elections, on a non-discriminatory basis.</li>
<li>No eligible citizen shall be denied the right to vote or disqualified from registration as a voter</li>
<li>Every voter is entitled to exercise his or her right equally with others and to have his or her vote accorded equivalent weight to that of others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Party Rights</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone has the right to take part in the government of their country and shall have an equal opportunity to become a candidate for election</li>
<li>Everyone individually and together with others has the right:
<ul>
<li>To express political opinions without interference;</li>
<li>To seek, receive and impart information and to make an informed choice;</li>
<li>To move freely within the country in order to campaign for election;</li>
<li>To campaign on an equal basis with other political parties, including the party forming the existing government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Responsibilities of States&hellip; to guarantee the rights and institutional framework for periodic and genuine, free and fair elections&rdquo;<a href="/print/62290#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>There are many ways in which there may be elections within an autocratic setting. In a few cases the &lsquo;democratic element&rsquo; is purely for show; Qatar is from this year (2013) holding elections (currently suspended due to a handover of power) for its advisory council but as an advisory body it is clear the real power will remain with the Emir.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> It is much more usual that the ruling party simply ensures that the opposition can never get enough seats to form a majority. This may be done in several different ways. In Burma (Myanmar) for example the National League for Democracy faces a parliament where many of the seats are not contested in elections, in the House of Representatives the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party has 259 seats, of which 110 were directly appointed.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> The main opposition the National League for Democracy won 40 out of the 45 seats it contested in byelections showing that it would likely win if there were an election without restrictions.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Alternatively as in Zimbabwe there may be intimidation and violence in the elections themselves.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> Or the results may be determined in advance through ballot stuffing, vote rigging, and bussing in supporters so they vote several times as occurs in Russia.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> The methods may be different but the outcome is the same; certain victory for the ruling party.</p>

                    <p>Holding sham elections is fundamentally dishonest as it is asking the people to choose a government and then ignoring their choice. Not holding elections is at least honestly telling the people that they get no say in who is in power. Holding a sham election inevitably means having to lie to the people somewhere along the line; whether it is in preventing people registering, or voting, or in manipulating the results. The people usually know the result is a sham or at least are suspicious &ndash; in the latest Zimbabwean election the headlines in the newspapers included &ldquo;ZANU-PF gloats over victory&rdquo;.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Without a sham election the government can at least be honest with their people so enabling a level of trust or even a kind of contract between the two &ndash; the government and the people each lets the other get on with it. Thus for example in China trust in government in 2012 was 76% against the world average of 51%.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>Being honest about depriving the people of their right to choose the government is not beneficial. An unwillingness to hold elections does not build any trust even when the government has proved itself capable at governing because an unwillingness to hold elections fundamentally shows distrust by government of the people. If the government trusted the people in return it would trust them to elect a competent government and representatives.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>It is hard to see what the benefit of an election that can change nothing is, but there are certainly all the costs associated with a normal election. Elections can be costly in financial terms, the United States elections cost several billion dollars but even much smaller and less extravagant elections need financing. Zimbabwe&rsquo;s elections in 2013 forced the government to ask its neighbours for $85 million to carry out the polls, for a nation that is essentially bankrupt this is a lot of money.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Another cost is uncertainty. In fully democratic elections the uncertainty is with what the policies will be when the government changes. With sham elections the uncertainty is whether the elections will be a focus for violence. Sometimes this is during campaigning itself as with Zimbabwe in 2008 where up to 200 people were killed.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Otherwise violence occurs when there is a perception that an election has been stolen so the Green Movement in Iran took to the streets and was met with a violent crackdown in 2009.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>

Countries without elections are not without opposition groups and protests, all this means is that the spark for the protests is going to be different; police beating someone up, a particularly extravagant piece of corruption, an attempted cover up, the disappearance of an opposition activist. Not having elections simply prevents the divisions in society from being highly visible; it does not get rid of the divisions, indeed it gets rid of one of the safety valves.</p>

                    <p>Democracy and elections are about popularity but popular decisions are not always the right ones. Even mature democracies have sometimes seen their government&rsquo;s make use of the levers of government to boost their electoral chances; for example Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s government stoked the economy in the Lawson boom in 1987 which just happened to be an election year.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Governments without elections can engage in long term planning and make unpopular decisions without fear of the consequences. Thus for example Saudi Arabia is willing to pump less oil (and so get less money in the short term at least) in order to create stability in the oil market by having enough excess capacity to prevent price spikes.</p>

                    <p>Not having any elections &ndash; or only elections for a powerless advisory parliament &ndash; may actually have a benefit in putting responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the rulers. Only a country that is comparatively well governed, or successful, can manage without a democratic safety valve.&nbsp; It is notable that the remaining absolute monarchies or those where the King rules as well as reigns are mostly very wealthy petro states. Several of the remaining communist regimes, China and Vietnam, rely on rapid economic growth to cement their legitimacy combined with meritocracy in their selection of leaders. In both cases there is an incentive for good governance by those in power as they are in for the long term. The leaders know they are not going to be elected out of office so have the motivation to reduce corruption and create long term growth through investment in infrastructure because this will benefit them in the future.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>The problem with good governance and economic success as the basis of legitimacy is that a crisis of legitimacy is created whenever growth falters or corruption comes to light. Legitimacy based upon performance also has the problem that if a certain performance becomes normal then the benchmarks must be higher and higher over time to continue to provide legitimacy.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Having legitimacy at least in part based on periodic elections, even if these are somehow rigged, is more sustainable as the legitimacy is renewed whenever there is a new election or change in government. This has the added benefit that as fairer elections are seen as more legitimate there is a greater chance that sham elections will become real elections to ensure the regime has more legitimacy even at the risk of it being voted out -&nbsp; as shown recently by Burma being willing to take the democratic route.</p>

                    <p>The acceptance by most autocrats that there need to be elections shows the idea that legitimacy derives from the people is generally accepted.&nbsp; Meaning that these states are already part way to having a genuine democracy. Having regular elections, even if the outcome is preordained, means that the electorate becomes used to voting and the idea of voting to make their voice heard. In such circumstances eventually they are going to want their vote to really count. If there is a creeping process of reform eventually this will result in free and fair elections.</p>
<p>Having any kind of elections means that there are people who are recognised as an opposition. This means that there is a viable alternative to the ruling party which can be turned to in a crisis, or can take on the leadership role when the regime is finally toppled. For example in Philippines the opposition was able to create a united opposition party in 1984 and coalesce around Corazon Aquino in the snap elections of 1985.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This meant that Aquino was in a position to swiftly set up a government following the people power revolution and flight of Marcos.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>States can have elections that have almost no chance of changing the government for decades. These elections can actually set back the cause for genuine democracy. There are several reasons for this. First having elections, or marginally expanding the number of parties or franchise, so providing liberal political reform can be used to keep the opposition on side through constantly dangling the prospect of further reform. Thus Sadat in 1977 allowed elections in response to discontent over peace overtures to Israel and in 1984 following his assassination Mubarak made these elections multiparty.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Secondly having elections can be used to disrupt the opposition as coalitions of disparate elements are difficult to create so it will likely lead to internal squabbling and victory for the ruling party. Encouraging such squabbling will then prevent there being a single recognised opposition party or figure than can be seen as able to take over. When there is no clear path after a revolution the people are going to be much more likely to stick with the dictator they know.</p>

                    <p>Elections almost anywhere in the world mean politicians getting out and campaigning. Regardless of the legitimacy of the final election the leadership of the country will be going out and meeting voters. In many of these events individuals won&rsquo;t be able to express their views but there are also likely to be protests and meetings where individuals can get their views across. This provides an opportunity for the leader to stay in touch with the people &ndash; often a problem with dictators who have been in power too long. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Dictators will want to, and often believe that they are likely to win even without resort to fraud, as Marcos did in 1985.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> They are then are much more likely to consider the views of the electorate to still be relevant if there are elections than if there are not.

If there are multiple different parties competing in the elections then it will be possible to tell which party platforms are the most popular and so which to take ideas from.</p>
<p>If there are elections then there are opposition parties and independent MPs who are given much more space than they would be without elections. Being MPs gives the opposition some status and gives them a controlled setting in which to criticise the government.

                    <p>For an autocracy the election for the top job needs to be predetermined, but the other elections do not. This means that elections for the legislature can still be competitive. The seats do have some influence, provide patronage, and have status attached so there are plenty of people who want to contest them. In the Arab world before the Arab spring there was a less than 25% incumbency rate for legislatures.<a href="/print/62290#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Having elections that determine control in local areas or allow opposition some control in parliament is far preferable to the alternative where the government appoints everyone.
