    <h1 class="print-title">This House would introduce compulsory identity cards</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>In an age of technology, more and more information can be gathered from an individual for security measures, for example for fingerprint<a href="/print/17933#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> or iris<a href="/print/17933#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> checks at airport security. While the intention of this may be to increase security across nations<a href="/print/17933#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>, some people have begun to question how much of their personal information is really needed by government organisations, and whether their liberty is as risk<a href="/print/17933#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. While the standards of identity cards may vary from country to country, nations such as the UK<a href="/print/17933#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>, Canada<a href="/print/17933#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>, the USA<a href="/print/17933#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>, France<a href="/print/17933#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> and Australia<a href="/print/17933#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> have all debated implementing a system of biometric identity cards. In this case, each citizen would have a card with their personalised data, such as a fingerprint<a href="/print/17933#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a>. However, this information may be expanded to include other information such as medical records<a href="/print/17933#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a>, and use of identity cards may ‘function creep’<a href="/print/17933#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> to an extent where it may eventually double as identification for an individual’s bank account or car ownership<a href="/print/17933#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a>, or even as a passport<a href="/print/17933#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a>. The technology is constantly growing and may some day incorporate many other aspects of ordinary, everyday life if this motion were to be implemented. It is fair to assume that, under the motion, an individual would be required to produce their identity card whenever requested by a figure of authority; for example a policeman or welfare officer.</p><p>&nbsp;While it is possible for the proposition to frame the debate around a standard identification card which does not necessarily feature biometric information, this is already status quo in countries such as Belgium, Germany and Portugal<a href="/print/17933#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a>. Arguably these examples could form a policy for the proposition side to propose. However, given that many people already carry a form of basic identification with their name on – such as a driver’s license or credit card – the debate would perhaps be broader, and bring more interesting points of discussion, if the proposition’s mechanism featured biometric identity cards. These are the source of much topical discussion and invoke arguments over privacy of information, the use and safety of biometric information by the government, and the true benefit to the cardholder.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17933#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> The Telegraphy. ‘Heathrow Airport first to fingerprint.’ Published 07/02/2008.

                    <p>Identity cards could prove a key instrument to combat crime, terrorism and fraud. Given that terrorists have used fake passports to cross borders in the past<a href="/print/17933#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, a sophisticated identity card, possibly containing specific biometric information which cannot be easily faked, could be crucial in preventing terrorist acts in the future. In cases where the police were suspicious, they could rapidly check the identities of many people near a crime scene, which would make their investigation much swifter and more effective. The CBI also believes that ‘the creation of a single source of identity data’<a href="/print/17933#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> in the form of biometric identity cards would also decrease identity fraud. Given that identity fraud currently costs the UK £2.7 billion per year<a href="/print/17933#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>, Canada over 10 million Canadian dollars per year<a href="/print/17933#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>, and in America identity fraud relating to credit cards alone costs around $8.6 billion per year<a href="/print/17933#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>, this is obviously a serious problem under the status quo. These crimes would be much more difficult if biometric data was required for financial transactions and other activities such as leaving or entering a country; identity cards are the best way forwards. The value of ID cards in combating terrorism and crime is much reduced if not everyone has them as the guilty would be less likely to want to get such cards unless they could somehow fake them.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17933#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Accessed from <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010%5C08%5C10%5Cstory_10-8-2010_pg7_17">http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010%5C08%5C10%5Cstory_10-8-2010_pg7_17</a> on 10/09/11</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17933#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Accessed from <a href="http://www.citizenshipfoundation.org.uk/main/page.php?217#arguments_identity_fraud">http://www.citizenshipfoundation.org.uk/main/page.php?217#arguments_identity_fraud</a> on 10/09/11</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17933#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Accessed from <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/nfa/">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/nfa/</a> on 10/09/11</p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17933#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> Accessed from <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/scams-fraudes/id-theft-vol-eng.htm">http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/scams-fraudes/id-theft-vol-eng.htm</a> on 10/09/11</p></div><div id="ftn5"><p><a href="/print/17933#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> Accessed from <a href="http://www.banking-gateway.com/microsites/oracle/US%20Card%20Fraud.pdf">http://www.banking-gateway.com/microsites/oracle/US%20Card%20Fraud.pdf</a> on 10/09/11</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>If anything, this is a reason to introduce better police training, not to abandon the concept of identity cards altogether.

                    <p>The entire premise of national security and crime prevention falls when biometric identity cards are in fact incredibly easy to falsify. Microchips have already been forged in a matter of minutes in an experiment to determine their security<a href="/print/17933#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, and biometric information can be gained remotely by computer through ‘cracking’, ‘sniffing’ and ‘key-logging’<a href="/print/17933#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Moreover, common crimes which would not require any kind of identification to be committed – vehicle theft, burglary, criminal damage, common assault, mugging, rape and anti-social behaviour<a href="/print/17933#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> – would not be combated at all by this measure. Given that hackers have managed to penetrate even the highest-security sites such as the CIA database<a href="/print/17933#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>, there is not only a danger that individual cards would be hacked, but that the greater database of information could be hacked. There is no such thing as an impenetrable security system. We would be far better off using the money which would potentially be funnelled into identity cards to increase computer security and police presence.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17933#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> The Times. ‘ “Fakeproof” e-passport is cloned in minutes.’ Published on 06/08/2008.

                    <p>The more information which is incorporated into identity cards, the greater the problems if they are misplaced or stolen. You would be ‘required to report the theft at a police station’<a href="/print/17933#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> rather than being able to cancel by phone, because the only way to prove that you are the owner of the card would be to have your biological information – like your fingerprints - scanned<a href="/print/17933#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Moreover, if your details were stolen online and used without your knowledge, the ‘illusion of security’<a href="/print/17933#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> surrounding the cards would make it very difficult to probe that it was not in fact you who was using the card. Jerry Fishenden of Microsoft also pointed out that ‘if core biometric details such as your fingerprints are compromised, it is not going to be possible to provide you with new ones’<a href="/print/17933#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. It is also unreasonable to expect someone to carry this card on them at all times, particularly if police or other authorities <em>are</em> able to stop and search on demand. Overall, the introduction of biometric identity card would create enormous problems for the everyday user if the slightest thing went wrong.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17933#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Accessed from <a href="http://www.idcardandyou.co.uk/crime.html">http://www.idcardandyou.co.uk/crime.html</a> on 10/09/11</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17933#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Accessed from <a href="http://www.idcardandyou.co.uk/crime.html">http://www.idcardandyou.co.uk/crime.html</a> on 10/09/11.</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17933#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Accessed from <a href="http://www.idcardandyou.co.uk/crime.html">http://www.idcardandyou.co.uk/crime.html</a> on 10/09/11.</p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17933#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> Accessed from <a href="http://www.idcardandyou.co.uk/crime.html">http://www.idcardandyou.co.uk/crime.html</a> on 10/09/11.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
