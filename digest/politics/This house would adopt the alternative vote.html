    <div class="print-content"><p>The Alternative Vote (AV) electoral system is currently used to elect representatives to Australia&#39;s House of Representatives. It is sometimes called the Instant Run-off system (in America) or preferential voting (in Australia). Many of those who are dissatisfied with the First Past the Post (FPTP) electoral system used in the UK and USA argue for a change to AV. The UK Labour Party advocated AV in their manifesto for the 2010 General Election, and the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition held a referendum on changing the voting system for the UK House of Commons to AV on May 5th 2011.</p>
<p>Like the FPTP system used in the USA and the UK, under AV each constituency or electoral district elects one representative to the legislature (Parliament, Assembly or Congress). But FPTP simply asks people to put a mark against the person they prefer. For a candidate to win under FPTP, they have to get more votes than any other candidate, meaning one may be declared the winner with less than 50% of the votes. The Alternative Vote system differs by ensuring that the winner of each constituency has to have the support of over half the voters &ndash; for this reason it is classed as a majoritarian system. AV achieves this by asking each voter to rank the candidates in order of preference. First preference votes are then counted and if one candidate has over 50% of votes cast, they are automatically declared the winner. If no one has over half the votes cast, then the candidate with the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated, and their votes given to the second-choice candidate on their voters&rsquo; ballot papers. If after adding these redistributed votes one candidate now has over 50% of the votes, then they are declared the winner; if not, the remaining candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their ballot papers redistributed, and so on. Eventually one candidate must end up with the support of over half the voters, and so will represent that constituency/district in the legislature.</p>

                    <p>Under FPTP, party representatives can focus on the concerns of 30% or so of citizens on whose vote they rely on for re-election. This results in tribal politics. AV, in forcing MPs to gain 50% of votes, forces them to consider those outside their core voters.</p><p>Also, according to the Jenkins report (see bibliography) AV would be likely to create more marginal seats; this is good for democracy. Parties currently place more extreme candidates in safe seats to ensure they get elected. Decreasing the number of safe seats is another way of ensuring that candidates have to address all members of their population and be accountable to all constituents. The Political Studies Association suggests that "Evidence from the UK and elsewhere suggests that MPs in marginal seats do focus on servicing their constituency more than those in safe seats." <sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/may/03/av-yes-no-referendum-vote" target="_blank"> Stratton, 2011, accessed 31/5/11 </a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>AV does little to empower voters as they must still choose between the main political parties. Each party chooses a candidate who is then appointed to/imposed upon an area. Voters who like the party but dislike the candidate face a difficult decision.</p><p>With preferences and vote transfers in abundance one might conclude that the number of safe seats would fall with AV but this does not follow: "It depends on how deeply the pattern of preference transfers would be entrenched in any constituency. A party that regularly received 40% of first preferences and could rely on another 15% of transferred preferences would win a seat just as comfortably as if it received 55% of 1st preferences. We have no evidence to suggest that a voter's 2nd preference would be any less firmly held than their 1st."<sup>1</sup> There is no evidence that 'safe seats' would be any less safe under AV.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.av2011.co.uk/Q7.html" target="_blank">AV 2011, accessed 31/5/11</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>The current FPTP system is undemocratic; currently a majority government can be created with a minority of the vote, because MPs are elected with less than 50% of the vote, lending their decisions little legitimacy. "According to figures from the Electoral Reform Society, 434 MPs [of 650] received less than 50 per cent of the vote" at the 2010 General Election<sup>1</sup> which means the majority of their constituents did not vote for them. AV ensures that elected representatives have the support the majority of their candidates because they have to get more than 50% of the vote.

                    <p>The Alternative Vote often prevents the most popular candidate from winning. In a race with several contenders, one may be far more popular with the voters than any other, gaining perhaps 40% of first preference votes while the next candidate might be 20% behind them. But quite often as less popular candidates are eliminated, their second and lower-preference votes don't go to the leading contender and the eventual winner ends up being an inoffensive centrist who was few citizens' first choice.<sup>1</sup></p><p>AV is not suitable for a multi-party system and can produce skewed and unfair results at a national level. Put simply, AV means a party can come second in every constituency in the country, with perhaps 30% or more of the national vote, and win no seats at all in the legislature. Although this is a theoretical outcome, in practice AV over-rewards the most popular party, under-rewards the next most popular, and greatly penalises third and minor parties. This is undemocratic as the views of millions of voters can go unrepresented, and a party with no more than 40% of first preference votes nationally may end up with a comfortable majority.</p><p>It must also be noted that AV does not guarantee that governments, once elected, make decisions that reflect the preferences of voters.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/blog/?p=80" target="_blank">Electoral Reform Society, 2010, accessed 31/5/11</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p>        </div>

Voters should not have to settle for a system that is by its own admittance flawed: Nick Clegg originally called AV a "miserable little compromise" .<sup>1</sup> Saying that it is 'less unfair' is not justification enough for the cost and effort it would take voters and politicians to change. The results of the AV referendum on May 5th 2011 (a 68-32% defeat) suggest that the voters feel the same way. Voters still see FPTP as the best. It works, having been tried and tested for centuries in Britain. It creates governments which are stable and strong, with a solid foundation and mandate to rule.

                    <p>AV is successful in Australia, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea. It is a staging post en route to PR. It is less dramatic than PR and this means that it is more likely to be accepted as a transitional stage. Sharing many characteristics with PR, the final change would be fairly simple for voters and politicians, and indeed after a time with AV, PR may come to be seen as an obvious solution to our electoral system. The Political Studies Association says: "A 'yes' vote would probably make further electoral system change later on more likely."<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/may/03/av-yes-no-referendum-vote " target="_blank"> Stratton, 2011</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Under the FPTP electoral system, supporters of minority parties either waste their vote to support their ideals, or decide which of the leading parties they dislike lease and vote accordingly. Research reported by the British Academy indicates that 15% of people voted for a party other than their most preferred in the 2005 general election.<sup>1</sup> This leaves voters unhappy at having to vote for the lesser of two evils. This also perpetuates the tradition two-party politics in the UK, as it makes it hard for a third party to gain enough votes to break through nationally. "Under AV there would be no technical reason for voting tactically for your most preferred candidate."<sup>2</sup> AV allows voters to express their preferences honestly, as their first preference vote can be a protest vote for a minority party; when that is inevitably eliminated, their mainstream vote will still contribute to the result. AV encourages positive voting.</p><p>This also means that voters feel that all votes matter. FPTP disenfranchises many who do not vote for the two main parties. It is still one person one vote, it is just that some people's vote may be for different candidates in different rounds if their first preference has been eliminated. Everyone has a say in the final outcome.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.britac.ac.uk/policy/choosing-electoral-system.cfm" target="_blank">Hix et al, 2010, accessed 31/5/11</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://fullfact.org/blog/AV_referendum_FPTP_tactical_voting_yes_to_fairer_votes_no_to_AV-2620" target="_blank"> Balls, 2011, accessed 31/5/11</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>AV is bad for voter choice. AV may squeeze extremist parties but it also tends to push the main parties to the centre as they seek first and second preferences votes and so must appeal to a large segment of the population. Often this means that parties are discouraged from developing radical or distinctive policies, and they can abandon their traditional support-base in their desperation to secure the approval of the large UK 'middle'. This would lead to an accentuation of the trends seen under 'Blue Labour' and 'Red Tory'.</p>        </div>

                    <p>AV does not make parties homogenous. Parties hold hugely differing values and they must still emphasise their differences in order to get votes. Indeed, they must work harder to prove their policies as under AV they must gain second preference votes; they cannot rest on support for the party alone. AV just means that politics is less factional; campaigns are fought not to define one party or candidate against another, but for the greater good of the voters.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Irrespective of whether it is complicated or not, AV is perceived as being complicated and this means that political engagement with it is low. Confusion over requirements also leads to a higher incidence of spoiled ballot papers under AV. One consequence of AV is that voters rank candidates 1, 2, 3, 4 in descending order down their ballot papers, which skews results. Under AV, Australia has a rate of ballot spoilage more than five times higher than the UK: 5.6% of votes in Australia were spoiled in 2010, compared to under 1% in the UK's last general election. While compulsory voting does increase the level of spoiled ballots, the Australian Election Commission has estimated that only 25% of spoiled ballots are deliberately spoiled, the overall rate still far higher than in Britain under FPTP.<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/voting/index.htm" target="_blank">Australian Electoral Commission, 2006, accessed 26/7/11 </a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>If AV is suitably explained, it is an easy system to understand. Numbering preferences is no more difficult than placing a cross next to one; it simply requires a more consideration about voting patterns, which is not a bad thing.</p><p>Further, AV in Britain would not be the same as in Australia. Theirs is a preferential system requiring all candidates to be numbered; AV in Britain simply allows ballot papers to be numbered. Australia requires voters to use all their preferences, increasing the likelihood of putting two 2's or 5's, for instance. The UK system of AV would allow voters to use only one preference, or as many as they liked. "If you want to vote for only one person, you can do that– in other words, vote exactly as you would under the current system. You can rank as many or as few candidates as you want. If there are 8 names on the ballot, and you’re only comfortable ranking three of them, you can do that. If you want to rank all 8, you can do that too.<sup>1</sup> The UK's proposed system eliminates this barrier for poorer and less educated people, even allowing them to use a single "X" if they wish.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://thoughtundermined.com/?p=1918">Thoughtundermined</a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span><a href="http://thoughtundermined.com/?p=1918">, 2011, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span>accessed 31/5/11</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Unlike other proportional representation systems the alternative vote is easy to implement when changing from first past the post. This is because AV does not represent a very large change in terms of how the voting system would work. AV keeps the same constituencies so MPs and candidates would be competing for the same votes they have always done. Voters would remain in the same constituency so preventing any confusion that would be involved in a fully proportional system. The relative small change and therefore the ease to implement can be shown by the relatively small changes had the 2010 general election been fought under AV. Labour would have won ten fewer seats, the Conservatives twenty three less and Liberal Democrats thirty two more.<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/for-and-against-av/5732" target="_blank"> Factcheck, 2011, accessed 7/7/11 </a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span></p>        </div>
