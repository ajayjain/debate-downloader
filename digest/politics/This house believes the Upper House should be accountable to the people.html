    <h1 class="print-title">This house believes the Upper House should be accountable to the people</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>In many democracies, the legislature consists of two separate ‘chambers’ or ‘houses’. This practice is called ‘bicameralism’. Usually, the lower house is directly elected by the people. In the past, membership of the upper house was hereditary, like the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, which today still had hereditary seats, or Japan’s House of Peers, which until 1947 was hereditary. Nowadays the upper house is usually either appointed by another governing body, or indirectly elected.</p><p>An example of an appointed upper house is the Senate of Canada. In this system, each major area in Canada has 24 seats. Members are appointed by the Governor General (a largely ceremonial function) on the ‘advice’ the Prime Minister (so, practically the Prime Minister appoints the members) and remain in their seats until they reach the age of 75.</p><p>An example of an indirectly elected upper house is the Dutch ‘Eerste Kamer’. In this system,&nbsp; each province has an allotted number of seats based on their respective population sizes. Members for the seats are then chosen via election by the provincial legislatures and remain in their seats until the next provincial elections, after which the renewed provincial legislatures will hold a new election for the upper house.</p><p>This case argues that the upper house should be directly elected by the people, just as the lower house, but via a different voting system. An example of this is the United States Senate (upper house) vis-à-vis the United States House of Representatives (lower house). Whereas in the House of Representatives each State has seats apportioned according to their population size, in the Senate each State is represented by two Senators, regardless of their population size. Because the direct election system for both the lower and upper house can vary in different legislatures, I am not going to specify which exact voting system the upper house will be using – I only assume that it is a direct voting system different from the direct voting system for the lower house.</p><p>The upper house and lower house can also differ in the amount of legislative power they have. Usually, in so-called presidential systems, where the executive is directly elected, the upper house has equal legislative powers as the lower house. For example, the United States Senate is generally equal to, and in some special cases even more powerful than, the House of Representatives. In many parliamentary systems, where the executive is derived from the lower house, the upper house usually has less powers then the lower house. For example, the Senate of Canada, unlike the House of Canada, can’t force the Prime Minister to resign. The Dutch ‘Eerste Kamer’ can’t initiate legislation whereas the ‘Tweede Kamer’ can.</p><p>This case also makes no choice as to what the exact division of powers should be between the separate houses and focuses only on the question whether it should be directly elected by the people or not.</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>Democracy means self-governance by the people, wherein citizens have the fundamental right to decide how they are to be governed and by whom.

                    <p>Democracy isn't just 'direct elections'. Democracy is a means to ensure good governance. Stating that an appointed or indirectly elected upper house is 'undemocratic' is not enough. Instead, the proposition should show why an appointed or indirectly elected upper house hinders good governance. Moreover, given the fact that the upper house is either appointed by the directly elected executive, as in Canada, or elected by directly elected provincial legislatures, as in the Netherlands, the people still have the right to decide how they are governed, only indirectly.</p>        </div>

                    <p>When an upper house is directly elected, it will be perceived to be more legitimate by the public, because the public sees their political views directly translated into a legislative branch, albeit in a different way than the lower house. This enhanced legitimacy will help the upper house in performing their constitutional duties: whenever the upper house disagrees with either the lower house or the executive, the upper house can now strengthen their position by pointing to the public support it has.</p>        </div>

An upper house has a different role in the political process than the lower house: the lower house has to channel public opinion whereas the upper house has to provide critical scrutiny and sober second thought.

                    <p>Politicians who elect or appoint the members of the upper house have an incentive to put their friends an allies there, because this will make their decision making easier. This is patronage pure and simple: the public will have a hard time sending them away when, if ever, a scandal breaks because the members of the upper house don't depend on public opinion to remain in their seats. An example is the case of a senator in the Netherlands, Sam Pormes. After an opinion magazine revealed he once had partaken in terrorist activities, it took almost a year and several mediation attempts to get him removed from parliament.<a href="/print/17835#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17835#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Expatica, ‘Senator told to resign over 'guerrilla training''. 22 November 2005. <a href="http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/senator-told-to-resign-over-guerrilla-training-25533.html " title="http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/senator-told-to-resign-over-guerrilla-training-25533.html ">http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/senator-told-to-resign-over-g...</a> last consulted August 15, 2011.</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Sober second thought is undemocratic. A directly elected upper house can also provide an extra cycle in the legislative process if this is deemed desirable. When it comes to 'halting hypes', we need to realize that what constitutes a political hype is also a political choice. Democracy is defined as 'rule by the people'. If public pressure for a certain law is mounting, this means that apparently a large part of the public is urgently in favor of it. If democracy truly means 'rule by the people', then the legislative should respond to this kind of public pressure and not effectively hinder the rule of the people out of some misguided notion of 'political hype'.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Appointment or indirect election provides space to involve eminent or expert people into politics. Often, expert and eminent people don't have the time or resources to work on building a career in politics. An example is veteran professional hockey coach Jacques Demers, who was appointed by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper to become a Senator. Demers has been nearly illiterate for all his life but has been a very successful coach. As a Senator, Demers helped raise awareness and generate policy to enhance literacy across Canada.<a href="/print/17835#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17835#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> TSN, ‘FORMER NHL COACH DEMERS TO BE NAMED TO SENATE’. 27 August 2009. <a href="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=288991" title="http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=288991">http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=288991</a> last consulted August 15, 2011.</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Expert opinion shouldn't play a role at the legislative stage of political decision making. Expertise is relevant for policy making, but doesn't have a place in the legislative. The legislative is a place for deliberation and negotiation amongst public interests. Expert opinion should inform policy making either via expert policy makers who work for ministries and departments and help draft legislation before it is launched, or via the public, whom they inform and persuade via articles, talk shows and publicizing research.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Appointment or indirect election provides space to involve leaders of business and civil society in politics. Just like above-mentioned experts, they often don't have time to build a career in politics. But they do have first-hand knowledge of the effects of policy on their businesses and associations. By co-opting them in the legislative process, policy makers don't have to wait until policy is fully implemented to receive feedback on the feasibility of their ideas.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Feedback in the legislative process reeks of cronyism. Ensuring policy is feasible by checking it with target groups and implementing partners is important. Governments often do this by calling for position papers and organizing focus groups. Using an upper house for this only reeks of cronyism: for example, why would the government award a seat to one big oil company but not to the other?</p>        </div>
