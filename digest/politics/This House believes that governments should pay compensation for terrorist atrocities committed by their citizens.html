    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes that governments should pay compensation for terrorist atrocities committed by their citizens</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Terrorism, according to Wikipedia, is, broadly speaking, “those violent acts which are intended to create fear (terror), are perpetrated for a religious, political or ideological goal, and deliberately target or disregard the safety of&nbsp;civilians or non-combatants”. There is some debate as to whether or not we can distinguish between terrorism and freedom fighters but for the purposes of this debate when we refer to terrorists we refer to groups such as al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Irish Republican Army, Taliban and other such organisations that are generally recognised as terrorist. Compensation refers to a monetary payment given to the individual who are wither direct victims of a terrorist attacks or else to family members who suffer as a result of the death of a loved one. It would be wise as a proposition to begin the debate by stipulating that this would only be possible where it is clear who the perpetrators were and what their nationality was.</p><p>There are two possible scenarios. Either the terrorists have committed the atrocities in their own nation in which case there is less debate as we are far more inclined to believe that governments have certain duties towards their own citizens, or terrorists commit atrocities in countries other than their own, in which case there is a greater burden on the proposition to show why the state ought to be held responsible.</p><p>So the questions to be answered in this debate are: Are we justified in holding a state responsible for terrorist acts committed by its citizens? What will the consequences of this policy be?</p><p>The UN suggests: The more viable alternative [to the motion under debate] is to create an international fund for victims of terrorism. Terrorism is a global phenomenon and we need a global solution to this menace so that the damage is mitigated to a certain extent. This view of setting up an international fund was even backed by the UN since the government can’t pay every time. This fund was originally suggested to be providing financial support rather than compensation but could be easily adapted will serve better is a more viable alternative instead of calling on the government to pay up for acts of terror.<a href="/print/17771#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>This is one possible line that an opposition can take. It is also possible for the opposition to argue that the government of the victims should pay the compensation or that there should be no compensation at all. I will run the opposition line that the victim government should be paying compensation.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17771#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> United Nations, ‘Supporting Victims of Terrorism’, January 2009, <a href="http://www.un.org/en/terrorism/ctitf/pdfs/un_report_supporting_victims_terrorism.pdf">http://www.un.org/en/terrorism/ctitf/pdfs/un_report_supporting_victims_terrorism.pdf</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-editors">

                    <p>The state must pay compensation for the terrorist attacks because they are indirectly responsible for them. It is the state’s duty to ensure that its citizens act within the law by providing deterrents, education and by preventing crimes through the use of intelligence. Even if the terrorist atrocities do not take place within the state, they were most probably planned within the state or initiated by someone who lives in the state. This means that it was within the state’s power to have prevented the attack from taking place. Just as we would expect a state to investigate and track down a drug syndicate, we expect the state to track down terrorist organisations and prevent their activities.</p><p>In many cases, states are not only responsible in this manner but also in a more direct manner.</p><p>This may involve a paramilitary group – a group that acts like a military but whose affiliation with the state or whose existence is kept secret. It may involve the state supplying the terrorist group with weaponry, money or intelligence. In these cases the state should clearly be held liable for the atrocities committed. For example, Iran supports Hamas financially and also claims that it shares identical views on Palestine with Hamas.<a href="/print/17771#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad vowed to keep supporting Hamas until the collapse of Israel.<a href="/print/17771#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Syrian President Bashar Assad as another example provides both funds and weaponry for Hezbollah.<a href="/print/17771#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><p>Making the state pay for the wrongs of its citizens is therefore not only just but sends the message that the international community recognises the states involvement and duty in this regard. This means that the state becomes responsible in the sense that it takes the blame.</p><p><a href="/print/17771#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Wurmer,Meyrav. “The Iran-Hamas Alliance.” InFocus.

                    <p>It is unjust to expect the state to prevent terrorist attacks. Most of the terror attacks are covert operations which are totally outside the purview of the government in the sense that the ruling mechanism has no idea that attacks are being planned. Why should any government be responsible for acts which it hasn't endorsed, authorised or has no knowledge of whatsoever? Terrorist organisations are complex and difficult to track down. They spread themselves in a variety of locations. The structure of most terrorist organisations is such that individuals only communicate with their immediate superior and do not know the identity or whereabouts of any other member of the organisation, making it very difficult to gather intelligence. Another reason why it is difficult to track down terrorists is their unwillingness to offer up information. Terrorists are in many cases willing to die for their cause and so there is very little that we can do to persuade them to give up other members of the organisation or their plans. In short, they work very hard at hiding their plans and their members. It is a testament to this fact the US government, with their sophisticated means of gathering intelligence, took years to locate Osama Bin Laden. &nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, it is only rarely that we are certain of who committed a terrorist attack and what their nationality was.&nbsp; How difficult would it be, then, to determine whether or not the state was assisting such an organisation? This is very difficult to prove. The Lockerbie bombing took place in 1988 and it was only in 2011 that the Libyan president confessed that he had ordered the attacks. Even with a massive investigation it was not possible to prove his involvement until this confession.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, and very importantly, states are only responsible for the security of their own citizens and only have a duty to punish criminal acts within their own borders. The state is therefore not responsible and should not be required to pay compensation.</p><p>We would hold instead that it is the individuals who commit, plan and command the atrocities that should be held exclusively responsible.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>If states are expected to pay compensation in this way then they are incentivised to take action against terrorist organisations to prevent incurring this massive cost. They are more likely to put resources into investigating leads and to take a hard stance on terrorist activity. This will decrease the prevalence of terrorism or at least make more intelligence available.</p><p>Why would the expectations that a country should pay compensation be a strong enough motive to force nations to pay up? If it becomes commonplace and therefore expected, nations who do not pay compensation will be viewed as supporting terrorism or perhaps be suspected of being in cahoots with the terrorists. This would be very harmful to the nation. For example, in the case of the Lockerbie bombing, suspicion of Libya’s involvement lead to sanctions and poor international relations for many years. Libya ultimately felt it was better to pay $2.7billion, $10million per person killed, than continue to face UN sanctions.<a href="/print/17771#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17771#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> BBC News, ‘Q&amp;A: The Lockerbie compensation deal’, 14 August 2003, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3150793.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3150793.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3150793.stm</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Once again, this is unlikely to decrease terrorism because, as we explained, it is so very difficult to track down terrorists. Even if the state wants to deter terrorism they may not be able to.</p><p>Secondly, the fear of having to pay this compensation will make states more likely to try to hide terrorist activities in their nations and shelter terrorists who they know to have committed atrocities. They may deny any knowledge of the terrorist activities or even frame or blame other countries or terrorist organisations. &nbsp;This is certainly harmful to the war on terror.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Compensation can prevent more violence because the victims are less likely to seek revenge if they feel that a) they have been recognised as victims b) the perpetrators (at least someone representing the perpetrators) has suffered financially and so some justice has been done c) they are more satisfied with the outcome of events because they have received money. This is less important in scenarios such as the London train bombings and 9/11 where there is little chance of victims retaliating but it is important in conflicts that have revenge as a common theme. For example, the Israel-Palestine conflict involves a lot of retaliation resembling age-old family feuds. Feuds are often prevented through the payment of blood money, in Saudi Arabia blood money rates are 100,000 Riyals to compensate for the death of a Muslim man.<a href="/print/17771#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Perhaps we could use similar compensation to prevent some of this retaliation by compensating victims in the case of terrorism victims.&nbsp;</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17771#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Hürriyet, ‘Paying blood money to prevent blood feuds’, <em>Hürriyet Daily News</em>, 7 July 2009, <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=paying-blood-money-to-prevent-blood-feuds-2009-07-07" title="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=paying-blood-money-to-prevent-blood-feuds-2009-07-07">http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=paying-blood-money-to-prevent-b...</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Often when a terrorist attack occurs the victims feel anger not only towards the individual perpetrators or the terrorist organisation but towards the entire national, political, cultural or religious group they belong to. An example of this is the flood of anti-Muslim, anti-Arab sentiment that arose after the 9/11 attacks.<a href="/print/17771#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This has a lot of negative consequences because it means that perfectly innocent people will suffer hate crimes and ostracization which in turns is likely to turn those people against the victims of the terrorist attack. This kind of disharmony lays the foundation for poor international relations, discrimination and particularly make it difficult for integration to occur such a when a Muslim family moves to the US.</p><p>When the state pays compensation for the terrorist attacks they are making a statement that they recognise terrorism to be wrong. When this happens victims begin to distinguish from the terrorist organisation and the rest of the people in their cultural or national group. This allows for greater cultural reconciliation.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17771#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> “Islamaphobia.” Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>This is false. When the state pays compensation they are taking responsibility for the crime, as the proposition stated in their first argument, and in doing so they are associating themselves with the terrorists, not disassociating themselves as prop claims. Furthermore, if the state wanted to condemn terrorism they could simply release a statement doing so. This is a frank contradiction with props first argument.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The times when reparations tend to be suggested are when there is a wound of sorts between two groups of people that needs to be healed in order for there to be closure and reconciliation. An example of this is after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa when compensation was given to victims of apartheid.<a href="/print/17771#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> We would argue that terrorist attacks fit perfectly into this frame because terrorist attacks tend to be committed by one group with a particular political, religious or national identity against another group with a different political, religious or national identity. Compensation plays a role in reconciling these two groups.</p><p>This compensation is not purely to provide the victims with things they have lost e.g. if they have lost the breadwinner of their family money will help them and if their home was burnt down again money will help. Compensation from one’s own government can fulfil this need. But compensation from another government acts not only to fill financial needs but to provide reconciliation and closure.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17771#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> “Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa).” Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa)</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is often very difficult to identify the perpetrator of crimes. This is partly because the perpetrators are often at great pains to conceal their identity and partly because the perpetrators often die in the terrorist attack e.g. suicide bombers.

It took a further three years to find someone guilty.<a href="/print/17771#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The identification of the perpetrators of 9/11 required ‘the largest criminal enquiry in the history of the United States’.<a href="/print/17771#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> They had to follow half a million leads.
