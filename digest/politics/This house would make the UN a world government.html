    <div class="print-content"><p>The model of the nation-state has traditionally provided the basis for international relations. However, there are many problems which are impossible for individual nation-states to solve and which require international cooperation, for example environmental problems, third world poverty, international law, trading rules, etc. And cosmopolitanism is coming back into fashion; many people consider there to be such a thing as an international society with international laws. This has serious implications for the old nation-state model and evokes the possibility of the United Nations evolving into a popularly elected &quot;world government&quot;. Should (and could) such a government exist? &lsquo;World government&rsquo; refers to the idea of all humankind united under one common political authority. Arguably, it has not existed so far in human history, yet proposals for a unified global political authority have existed since ancient times &mdash; in the ambition of kings, popes and emperors, and the dreams of poets and philosophers.</p>

                    <p>The Oxford Dictionary defines democracy as a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state typically through elected representatives<sup>1</sup>. World Government should not be our ideal because it is blatantly less democratic than government on the nation-state model. The smaller the political unit, the more powerful is the individual vote. Individual citizens will always have more influence over local authorities and nation-state governments than they will over putative supranational entities. We value democracy and therefore oppose World Government because it dilutes the strength of an individual's influence over policy. There has always been a "democratic deficit" in even much smaller grouping of states such as the European Union, this would be elevating it to a planetary scale<sup>2</sup>. Voting rights would also be impossible to arrange fairly in a global parliament. If the current one-state, one vote system was retained then a coalition of small nations would be able to impose policies upon those states with a large majority of the world's population. If representation was on the basis of population, then China and India would often be able to act together to impose policies upon the rest of the world.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/democracy"> http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/democracy</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/janetdaley/6845967/Therell-be-nowhere-to-run-from-the-new-world-government.html"> http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/janetdaley/6845967/Therell-be-nowhere-to-run-from-the-new-world-government.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>The problem with this argument is that it presupposes national interest and operates within a framework where states still exist. This is precisely the problem the creation of a world government aims to ameliorate. Today, individual states are free to collude and skew world politics, and once they are eliminated as actors, every individual has the right to influence global politics and everybody has an equal share in decision-making. So, the problem this argument presents is not one of world government, but one of an international system dominated by nations.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The creation of a global parliament would end all wars. The interplay of political life would engender and reinforce an attitude of community and shared goals. Armed conflict is anathema to such a mindset. Just as the history of consensual, shared decision-making via the parliamentary process has virtually removed violence from the menu of political action in Western liberal democracies, so would a practice of parliamentary debate and decision effect such changes on a global scale. This is just the same as how parliaments within states have helped turn those states into nations and created a national consciousness even when uniting disparate peoples as in the United States. It is also being shown to occur internationally with the creation of the European Parliament which is slowly gaining in power.<sup>1</sup><br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.epha.org/a/3894"> http://www.epha.org/a/3894</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>It is utopianism at its absolute worst to dream of perpetual peace being brought about by a World Parliament. It is difficult to see how the power balance of international relations will be altered. States that are big enough and powerful enough will continue to pursue aggressive and oppressive policies in defiance of resolutions demanding them to cease. They will do so because they have the material and military capacity to ignore attempted restraints on their actions. To give two examples, Tibet would not enter this Parliament as a full member but as part of China, Chechnya would still be part of Russia. What dictates whether wars are prevented is realpolitik; action is taken when it is in the interests of those states, which are powerful enough to act. When war can be prevented and it is strategically useful to prevent it then action is taken (the Gulf War). But where action would involve incalculable losses and serves no immediate self-interest (Chechnya and Tibet) it will not be taken. Even today, most wars are civil, intra-state wars.<sup>1</sup> It is difficult to see how a world parliament would be better in addressing these than national governments.<br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.correlatesofwar.org/ ">http</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span><a href="http://www.correlatesofwar.org/ ">://www.correlatesofwar.org/ (Especially the data set on intra-state war)</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Many of the most serious problems in today's world are international, whether they are of an environmental or a political nature. To attempt the solution of these problems through the negotiation of nearly 200 individual sovereign states is futile. Even if any agreement is possible (and agreement is by no means guaranteed) it will be characterized by insufficiency because of compromise between the many different power interests of the separate sovereign states. This has been often exemplified in the case of negotiations involving global interest such as climate change, most recently at Copenhagen in 2010. This Consequently, nation-states should cede sovereignty over very important international issues so that effective action can be taken. World Government should be an ideal towards which we gradually work. The universal problems of human rights and the environment obviously cry out for universal solutions. But gradually, we can foresee other issues such as taxation-policy, education and law and order being decided at international level. The principle behind this is that humans are fundamentally similar. Ethnicity, religion or other cultural considerations can add variety and spice to daily life but they should not be obstacles to the recognition of globally shared interests and, consequently, to the introduction of global decision making.</p>        </div>

                    <p>This argument does not advocate for global government, but global governance, the key difference being that global government requires the amalgamation of nation states into one world state, while global governance advocates cooperation based on shared values.<br>The issue of human rights is indeed universal. To that end, intergovernmental cooperation has secured the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and numerous subsequent conventions. There are many intergovernmental conferences on human rights and other global issues such as the environment. And where agreements are not reached, or are not satisfactory, this reflects the genuine difference of interest and opinion amongst the different nation-states; it would be wrong, if not impossible for a global government to impose a single policy in these circumstances.</p>        </div>

                    <p>In the utopian concept of world government, all citizens of the world would obey a single authority. Not only is that practically impossible and essentially undemocratic as argued in the previous points, it is also detrimental as it removes the individual states as actors. States are necessary in the world as they act as buffers between the internal turmoil, the resolution of which they facilitate, and the external decision making on an international level. Without nation states, the result would be unmediated caucus, as the population of 7 billion would have no filter for the varying opinions, making consensus impossible, resulting in unrest and a halt in the development of the world<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/07/15/the_enduring_power_of_nationalism"> http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/07/15/the_enduring_power_of_nationalism</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>States are neither necessary nor desirable. The reasoning is based on the current norm that has been dominant for centuries&nbsp;– that without states there would be chaos. This is flawed reasoning. It is precisely the states that cause the chaos. They do not act as filters, they rather act as obstacles which individuals and pan-national organizations must overcome to have their voice heard. Removing localized interest which is epitomized and sustained by the concept of the state opens the way to cosmopolitan politics and decision-making.</p>        </div>

                    <p>National or regional identity is a real phenomenon; people identify themselves with their neighbors. This doesn't have to be in a cultural or shared-historical way, it can be as simple (and as telling) as shared a socio-economic position (Benedict Anderson explains how this can be by analyzing the creation of national awareness and forged identity through history in his work "Imagined Communities"<sup>1</sup>). Conflicting vested interests will remain and will be defended. To presume otherwise is utopian dreaming. It is entirely pointless to dream about such entities as World Parliaments because powerful, prosperous nation-states simply will refuse to cede their sovereignty to such entities lest they lose any control over the maintenance of their own comfortable societies, for example Britain is not willing to join the Euro, and China and the US are unwilling to join climate agreements that infringe on sovereignty <sup>2</sup>.<br><sup>1</sup> Anderson 1991<br><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/02/unconventional_wisdom?page=0,10">http</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/02/unconventional_wisdom?page=0,10">://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/02/unconventional_wisdom?page=0,10</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>While that may be true, a difference of interest is not a reason for abandoning the goal of world government. In every state, even in a local community, people have different religious, economic, political and other interests, and yet they find a way to reach decisions. World government will only expand the discussion to a global level, but without the hindrance of the political agendas of nation states. For example: ""United in diversity" is the motto of the European Union.<br>It signifies how Europeans have come together, in the form of the EU, to work for peace and prosperity, while at the same time being enriched by the continent's many different cultures, traditions and languages."<sup>1</sup><br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/index_en.htm"> http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/symbols/index_en.htm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Calls for world government in the post-World War II era implied a deep suspicion about the sovereign state's potential as a vehicle for moral progress in world politics. Emery Reves' influential The Anatomy of Peace is a condemnation of the nation-state as a political institution: "The modern Bastille is the nation-state, no matter whether the jailers are conservative, liberal or socialist". Echoing Rousseau, Reves argued that nation-states threaten human peace, justice and freedom, by diverting funds from important needs, prolonging a global climate of mistrust and fear, and creating a war machine that ultimately precipitates actual war. The experience of the world wars thus made it especially difficult to view states as agents of moral progress<sup>1</sup>.<br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/anatomyofpeace009815mbp"> http://www.archive.org/details/anatomyofpeace009815mbp</a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Conflict and interest groups cannot be eradicated by eliminating the nation state. Different interests will still exist, and without the buffer that international politics provides, they might prove even more difficult to consolidate into a decision. The world state is at even a greater risk of war between those interest groups as they will not have the release valve that is the state to regulate the expression of their interests.</p>        </div>
