    <h1 class="print-title">This house would let Turkey join the European Union</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Turkey has had a trade agreement with the European Union for over forty years, and first applied for membership of Europe’s premier club nearly forty years ago. Until ten years ago these requests were politely resisted; Turkey was never turned down outright but the EU made it clear that massive political and economic reforms would be needed before entry could even be considered. In 1999, however, EU leaders unanimously accepted Turkey as a candidate country, yet negotiations about entry did not begin until 2005.</p><p>Since 2005 the EU accession negotiations for Croatia and Iceland have advanced rapidly, but only one out of 35 chapters has been completed with Turkey; 20 have yet to be opened at all. This has led to Turkish suspicion that the EU is not really serious about ever including it. This suspicion seemed to be confirmed in November 2002, when Valery Giscard D’Estaing, a former President of France, declared that Turkey was an Asiatic nation that should never be allowed to join the European Union. Since then it has become the policy of France, Germany and Austria to oppose Turkish membership of the EU. They and some politicians in other EU states would prefer to offer a privileged partnership short of full membership; something which Turkey rejects. Greece and Cyprus do not reject the prospect of Turkish membership outright, but are insistent that progress should be dependent upon Turkey abandoning support for Northern Cyprus.</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-editors">

                    <p>The EU has welcomed poorer entrants than Turkey without disaster; Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece were all much poorer than the EU average when they joined and all are now well integrated and much more prosperous. Disastrous migration was forecast in their cases too, but did not occur. Nor is Turkey as poor as has been suggested; Turkey with a GDP per capita of $8215 in 2009 is richer than Romania at $7500 and Bulgaria with a GDP per capita of $6423<a href="/print/18104#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> both of which are already members. Turkey’s economy is also in the process of reform, including the restructuring of its banking system and IMF programmes; in the next few years this process will allow for faster, more sustained growth. Turkey provides a large new market for EU goods; should it be accepted into the single market the economic benefits would not be solely limited to that country.</p><p>Turkey’s inclusion in the EU would not threaten other members with overwhelming economic or immigration issues. It is possible that, as has happened with Bulgaria and Romania, that a delay is enacted for the Schengen passport-free zone<a href="/print/18104#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.

                    <p>The EU will never be able to integrate Turkey economically. Turkey is too poor, with millions of subsistence farmers and living standards far below the European norm (making massive migration to richer EU countries inevitable). "Despite its current population accounting for 15% of the EU-25 population, its GDP is equivalent to just 2% of the EU-25 GDP. Its GDP per capita is 28.5% of the EU-25 GDP (European Commission, 2004)"<a href="/print/18104#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. It would be a significant drain on EU funding to bring its economy and living standards to an acceptable level.</p><p>Turkey is a nation of over 70 million with significantly lower living conditions and wages than most EU member states. Most EU states are already going through a recession and credit crunch and are suffering enough without a potentially huge number of Turkish migrants legally given the right to live and work in 27 member states, but who would be expected to choose to reside mainly in the more prosperous member states such as the UK, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. This is especially a problem for Germany, who by 2004 already had 1.74 million Turkish people living in Germany<a href="/print/18104#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> who make up approximately one fourth of the immigrant population in Germany. To allow migrants to come in legally could potentially hinder Germany's economy significantly by increasing unemployment levels even further.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18104#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www6.miami.edu/EUCenter/nugentfinal.pdf">http://www6.miami.edu/EUCenter/nugentfinal.pdf</a>&nbsp; University of Miami study, ‘Turkey’s Membership Application: Implications for the EU’, Jean Monnet/Robert Schuman Paper Series, Vol 5 No 26 August 2005.</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/18104#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a><a href="http://www.faz.net/s/Rub594835B672714A1DB1A121534F010EE1/Doc%7EE0F99A1C8B80A445E84A70B8453383895%7EATpl%7EEcommon%7ESMed.html#F603AFF15A3548B08367A3ED2DB2733A">http://www.faz.net/s/Rub594835B672714A1DB1A121534F010EE1/Doc~E0F99A1C8B80A445E84A70B8453383895~ATpl~Ecommon~SMed.html#F603AFF15A3548B08367A3ED2DB2733A</a> ‘Turkish Migration in Germany’, chart breakdown of German immigration figures by country.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Romania and Bulgaria, who have by far the worst human rights’ records, were prioritized over Turkey when they were granted the right of accession, joining the EU in 2007. The EU rewarded states that have made a big effort to democratize and change policy in order to be allowed in to the EU. By essentially procrastinating on Turkey's case, the EU are discouraging Turkey from making the required changes to their legislature and norms and thus hindering their chances of accession. Countries such as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic were pressurized to reform at a rapid pace after being promised by the EU they would likely be in the EU in a relatively short period of time; Turkey has been given no such promises. Turkey should have even more 'right' to be in the EU as these states, as it formally applied for membership long before these states and should thus be given priority over them.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Turkey is a key geo-political strategic ally to the West and should be integrated fully in order to ensure its continued cooperation. "Turkey is a secular Muslim democracy and a crucial ally for the West. The eastern flank of NATO, straddling Europe and Asia, it played a critical role in containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War. In the 1990s, it helped monitor Saddam Hussein and protect Iraqi Kurds by permitting U.S. warplanes to use its bases. After the September 11, 2001, attacks, it became a staging area for coalition forces in Afghanistan, where Turkish forces eventually assumed overall command of the International Stabilization Force. Turkey continues to be a pivotal partner in the fight against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, despite attacks by radical Islamists at home."<a href="/print/18104#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18104#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60100/david-l-phillips/turkeys-dreams-of-accession">http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60100/david-l-phillips/turkeys-dreams-of-accession</a> ‘Turkey’s Dreams of Accession’ by David Phillips, <em>Foreign Affairs </em>September/October 2004</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There are fears that Turkey joining the EU would create the possibility of a ‘single market’ in terrorism. "Turkey will not be admitted to the E.U. It will not be admitted because, at this point, given the behaviour mainly of Arab Muslims (for does anyone doubt that it was the Arab influence that caused some Chechens to embrace not only the idea of Jihad, but all of the current methods being used to further it), Europeans have lost their stomach for parroting phrases about the religion of "peace" and "tolerance." They do not want to admit a country of 70 million Muslims, who would then move freely about Europe. They do not want Turkey admitted because it will be an easy conduit for non-Turkish Muslims to enter Europe, posing as Turks."<a href="/print/18104#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18104#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/2005/12/fitzgerald-turkey-will-not-be-admitted-to-the-eu.html">http://www.jihadwatch.org/2005/12/fitzgerald-turkey-will-not-be-admitted-to-the-eu.html</a> ‘Turkey will not be admitted to the EU’ by Hugh Fitzgerald, 6<sup>th</sup> December 2005</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Turkey was promised a chance to join the EU by a unanimous vote at the Helsinki summit in 1999, when its candidacy was unanimously accepted after three decades of consistent Turkish requests. As a candidate country Turkey should be allowed in once it meets the membership criteria which were first set out in the Copenhagen European Council of 1993. These were stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union and the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic &amp; monetary union.<a href="/print/18104#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Clearly economic and political reforms are necessary, but that is true of all states attempting to join the EU and should not be used as an excuse to backtrack now. It would be hypocritical to apply one set of criteria to Central and Eastern European states and another to Turkey. Such blatant hypocrisy would have consequences, if the EU is seen to break its promise to Turkey it may turn a potential friend and partner into a suspicious and hostile neighbour.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18104#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm</a> European Commission Enlargement, Accession criteria, 30<sup>th</sup> October 2010</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Turkey first applied to join the EU back in the 1960s but there is no document where EU leaders have promised unconditionally to include Turkey in the future. In a decade of candidacy Turkey has managed to satisfy less than half of the chapters, and these are only the <em>minimum </em>prerequisites. Even if they had, past declarations (as opposed to treaties) cannot be held to bind today’s leaders in weighing both their own national interest and the wider European interest. The possibility is therefore a long way off. The possible negative impact of Turkish EU membership upon existing members must be considered. The recent rise of far-right anti-immigration politicians, such as Marine Le Pen, Jorg Haidar and Pym Fortuyn, point to a dangerous public reaction to more open borders and unchecked migration.</p>        </div>

Today the location of a Mediterranean state in the North Atlantic is no longer considered as something "odd".&nbsp; Another example of changing perceptions of a region is the change from regarding the border of Europe as falling between East and West Germany; Europe broadened to include all the former Eastern European countries as potential members of the EU.</p><p>Given that part of Turkey’s territory is on what everyone accepts is the European mainland, why shouldn’t it be allowed to join the main European club?

Its election of a party with Islamist roots has led to a smooth transfer of power, with no attempt at intervention by the secularist military (as in the past).

Turkey signed and ratified Protocols 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It abolished the death penalty and adopted measures to promote independence of the judiciary, end torture during police interrogations, and reform the prison system. In addition, Turkey has significantly reduced the scope of its antiterrorism statutes, which had been used to curtail political expression, and it amended the Penal Code and Codes of Criminal and Administrative Procedure.

                    <p>Turkey’s citizens may be Muslims, but the state is as firmly secular as France in terms of its constitution and government. The new Justice and Development Party (AK) which is currently in government is not seeking to overturn the secular constitution, although it does want to amend some laws that positively discriminate against devout Muslims. These include rules such as the ban on women wearing headscarves in government buildings; restrictions on expressing religious belief which would break human rights laws within the EU.</p><p>Regardless of one's beliefs surrounding Turkey's possible ascension to the European Union, the fact that the nation's predominant religion is Islam is surely not one of the issues to be considered. Millions of Muslims already live within the EU; excluding Turkey from membership on the grounds of religion would suggest these European Muslims were second-class citizens in a Christian club. It would also presumably rule out future EU entry for Albania, Bosnia and Kosovo. If the EU is to be regarded as an institution that promotes freedom for the citizens of its member states then surely this also means that it promotes freedom of religion. If EU member states are fearful of building closer relations with Islam, which they will inevitably have to, proceeding with the world's most moderate and 'western' Islamic country is the most logical first step. The EU should welcome a state which could provide a positive example of how Islam is completely compatible with democracy, progress and human rights.</p>        </div>

This is a much smaller proportion than Germany represented in the EU of 15 before the 2004 enlargement (21.9%)<a href="/print/18104#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, so it is ridiculous to argue that Turkey would dominate EU decision-making. It would not gain full status for many years anyway; an inauguration period, in which it had semi-membership status, would introduce it slowly to the process. Turkey would not be able to change EU policy to suit itself as soon as it arrives.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18104#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.demographia.com/db-eu-pop.htm">http://www.demographia.com/db-eu-pop.htm</a> European Union (EU-15) &amp; Constituent Nation Population from 1950 &amp; Projections to 2050, Demographia, 2001 <a href="http://www.demographia.com/db-eu-pop.htm">http://www.demographia.com/db-eu-pop.htm</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Turkey is too big to be safely included within the EU. The Turkish population - estimated at 65.6 million in 2000 - is on current growth trends forecast to rise to 87.3 million by 2025, making it the largest single state in the EU<a href="/print/18104#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. As population size determines representation and voting strength in the Council of Ministers, and in the European Parliament, Turkey would be able to dominate EU decision-making and set its own agenda, to the disadvantage of existing members.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/18104#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.planbleu.org/publications/demo_uk_tur.pdf">http://www.planbleu.org/publications/demo_uk_tur.pdf</a>&nbsp; Population projections of countries and their coastal regions: Turkey</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
