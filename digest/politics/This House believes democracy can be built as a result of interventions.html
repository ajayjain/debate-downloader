    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes democracy can be built as a result of interventions</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Whether it takes the form of imperialism or the neoconservative movement, democratic countries have long seen it in their duty to &ldquo;civilize&rdquo; and &ldquo;democratize&rdquo; the countries that remain autocracies, dictatorships, monarchies, and communist regimes. While promoting freedom, justice, respect of law, and democracy seem like fair and worthwhile goals, they come at a price which has called into question the methods of democracy promotion. The West often justifies interventions, usually military, with freedom and democracy&mdash;ultimately the pain and bloodshed will be outweighed by the beauty of freedom. Part of the tension is that these intervening nations feel that they are right, and everyone else is wrong, which is not necessarily the case. Pushing Western ideals on other countries, particularly through war, is not undeniably just. Further, these interventions sometimes fail and many question whether democracy can come from war and violence. This debate focuses on the practicality of the matter: can interventions lead to functioning democracies? The cases of Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Libya will be particularly telling and pertinent. Just because it was successful or failed in one case, does not prove or disprove the entire argument, the larger trends and back story need also be analyzed.</p>

                    <p>Generally in interventions there are loyalists, rebels, and everyone else. Even when a leader is deposed and a new political system is swept in, the old political leaders remain. It is difficult to remove them from the electoral process, and doing so is undemocratic. Ultimately, old, loyalist leaders make democratic development from intervention difficult. In Libya, the intervention has only caused Qaddafi’s friends to rally around him, and lead him to hold on tighter to his power<a href="/print/17577#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. If this intervention is successful, this will only create divisions in the political system. In the case of Iraq, even though the original regime has been removed from power, Baathist, Hussein’s party, politicians still exist and the affiliation is creating problems for Iraq’s attempt at democracy. In the 2010 elections, 500 politicians were disqualified because of alleged Baathist ties, which were in some cases probably true, but not in all<a href="/print/17577#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. There is no way to remove old parties from the political system which creates two problems: one, if left alone they may bring anti-democratic influences, but two, if they are removed from the system that is inherently undemocratic.</p><p><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/libya/index.html">New York Times (2011), “Libya—Protests and Revolt”, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span>[Accessed July 19, 2011].</p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iraq/elections/index.html">New York Times (2010), “Iraq Elections”,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span> [Accessed July 19, 2011].</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>All incumbents attempt to hold onto power. If the democratic system is made strong enough, then even old politicians will have to be elected and chances are they will not be able to erode the system from the inside. There needs to be acceptance of who wins wins in a democracy, but that does not mean that once a country has devolved into dictatorship they cannot make a comeback due to old political leaders attempting to get involved.</p>        </div>

                    <p>One inhibitor to democratic development is not only the inability to overthrow a leader, but the feeling that without any external support, efforts to create democracy will be entirely futile. Interventions from the international community can be important signals of support to domestic, democratic movements. This means that foreign intervention does not have to be on its own, it is much easier to set up a functioning government after the intervention if there are strong native groups involved from the start. The intervention in Libya was organized by Western powers including the US and UK in an effort to support and protect the people calling for democracy and looking to bring justice to Libya. While the conflict in Libya is still going on, the rebel movement has not petered out, and the likelihood of success has been strengthened by international support and help<a href="/print/17577#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Interventions can present the necessary support for already present democratic movements to be successful, and can also provide guidance for establishing democratic institutions. For example the United States has helped Afghanistan organize democratic elections and a centralized government, which on their own they likely would have been unable to do<a href="/print/17577#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.</p><div><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_9431000/9431836.stm">Democracy Live (2011), “Libya intervention ‘may have averted crisis’-PM”, BBC,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span> [Accessed July 19, 2011].<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/sep/21/progress-for-democracy-in-afghanistan/">The Washington Times (2010), “Progress for Democracy in Afghanistan”,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span> [Accessed July 19, 2011].</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Once an actor intervenes in a nondemocratic country, they begin to demand reforms and put in place a new government. This, however, is the wrong way to go about building democracies. Bill Collier in his books <u>Wars, Guns and Votes</u> explains that the most volatile dangerous countries are those that are only semi-democratic; they want to look like democracies, but they are corrupt and very unstable. These countries take the necessary steps to being deemed a ‘democracy’ (ie. Elections, etc), but are only attempting to satisfy the countries supplying their aid, and once that is achieved reforms stop. The democratic development is not institutionalized and therefore is not successful. Take Afghanistan for example. The country has democratic elections, however they are controversial, corruption is rampant, the government isn’t centralized, and the government in Kabul has almost no power outside the city<a href="/print/17577#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. US intervention in Afghanistan has produced a country with elections, but the only way for a country to develop as a democracy is from pressure and dedication within, and that cannot be instituted through intervention. Without an internal movement, countries become overly dependent on the actor that intervened. Afghanistan and Iraq would likely not be able to run elections without US help, but intervening actors like the US do not want to be deeply involved in the country’s politics, which contributed to US failure in Somalia<a href="/print/17577#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. These torn attitudes, and over dependence makes it difficult for democracy to come from the ashes of intervention.</p><div><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.cfr.org/afghanistan/painting-democracy-afghanistan/p20500">Johnson, Thomas (2009), “Painting Democracy on Afghanistan”, Council on Foreign Relations,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span> [Accessed July 19, 2011].<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~jwestern/ir317/clark.htm">Clarke, Walter; Herbst, Jeffrey (1996), “Somalia and the future of humanitarian intervention”, Foreign Affairs Magazine,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span> [Accessed July 19, 2011]</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>During interventions usually factions are formed that fight against each other. It is very rare that it is just the loyalists against rebels fighting for freedom. Usually it is much more complicated with ethnic and religious groups taking different sides. Once these distinctions have been made during the fighting involved in the intervention, it is hard to heal from them. Even when peace comes, people are distrusting of other ethnicities and religions; they vote along those lines versus party platforms. Democracy calls for voting for the best qualified representative no matter their beliefs and race, yet the scars left behind from war take a lot of time to heal and inhibit democracy. For example, in 2006 a civil war broke out in Iraq thanks to the US intervention. There were different factions represented by the different ethnic and religious groups, namely the Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites<a href="/print/17577#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. The tensions that arose from this bloodshed have not subsided in peace time and remain prevalent in the political landscape of the country<a href="/print/17577#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.

                    <p>Often for democracy to take hold, countries need other logistical and development help. Education and literacy are important for a functioning democracy because only with the ability to acquire and analyze information can people make informed decisions about candidates. There need to be roads and buildings so that people can get to the polls and information can reach more rural areas. It is essential that a rule of law, and thus laws, prisons, and courthouses, and free press are established. All of this can be very expensive and require a fair amount of coordination. Interventions give countries a stake in the country they have invaded and thus push them to make the necessary investments to create a functioning democratic state. While Afghanistan is not democratic yet, US development has been very important in its changing political landscape. In 2001, 900,000 boys and no girls were enrolled in school in Afghanistan, today 7 million children, 35% of whom are girls, are going to school<a href="/print/17577#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. 5 million people have been lifted from extreme poverty as GDP per capita has doubled<a href="/print/17577#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. The economy is growing at 10% with government revenue at 1.65 billion dollars, and a stable currency is being used across the country<a href="/print/17577#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. The US has given 18.8 billion dollars of foreign aid to Afghanistan and has made some progress that without the intervention likely would not have been executed or successfully allocated.</p><div><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/blog/11020">Thier, Alexander, Foreign Policy Magazine Afpak channel,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span> [Accessed July 19, 2011].<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> ibid</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> ibid</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Chances are that if a country needs an intervention, democracy was probably not only inhibited by a lack of elections. Democracies need a free press, literate and active population, rule of law, a constitution, checks and balances, and even a functioning economy to help them remain stable. If there are no roads people can’t go vote and without some income, people are not concerned about voting. If people can’t read and there is no free media, then they cannot make informed decisions about candidates. For example Afghanistan is a tribal society with a culture of bribery which proposes obstacles to democracy<a href="/print/17577#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Somalia has a GDP per capita of $600, which is not even reflective of the distribution, and only has a little over 2,000 km of paved roads<a href="/print/17577#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Iraq rates 130<sup>th</sup> in the world in press freedom. The problems that plague nondemocratic countries are often too large for intervening nations to truly tackle and therefore democracy does not easily develop from interventions. Countries aren’t committed for the long haul once they see the money and time it will take to improve the political situation in nondemocratic nations.</p><div><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Kinzer, Stephen. <u>Overthrow</u>, New York: Times Books, 2006.<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html">CIA World Factbook, “Somalia”, Central Intelligence Agency,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span> [Accessed July 19, 2011].</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The resolution is not country specific and it is therefore worth examining the potential effect of interventions on countries that only witnessed the intervention, but were not part of it. When a country intervenes in another, the intervening party is making it clear that undemocratic behavior is unacceptable and oppression of citizens is not without consequences. NATO intervened in Libya under the responsibility to protect clause of the United Nations charter<a href="/print/17577#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. The intervention sends a message to the rest of the countries in the region with restless populations, that their oppression will not be tolerated and thus incentivizes democratic reform.

                    <p>Some governments are so oppressive, that even though people want democracy they have no power to effectively ask for it. Thousands have been protesting in Bahrain and their leader will not bend—some people simply don’t have the leverage or force to push their government out<a href="/print/17577#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. In these cases interventions can be effective. The first step to democratic formation is removing the dictatorial, undemocratic leaders. As long as a strong-man leader is at the helm of the state, democracy cannot flourish. After its intervention in 2003, Iraqi people celebrated the fall of Saddam Hussein, their dictatorial leader who had killed thousands of people<a href="/print/17577#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Iraq in 2010 held parliamentary elections that despite some violence and other problems had a large turnout and were arguably the most transparent, fair, democratic elections in the country’s modern history<a href="/print/17577#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. The first step was removing Saddam from power through an intervention, which has put Iraq on the road to democracy. Intervening countries need to be careful to work with the local populations, and minimize civilian casualties, but as long as caution is used this tactic can be successful.</p><div><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://, http://www.npr.org/2011/03/13/134513834/bahrain-protests-throw-kingdom-into-chaos">National Public Radio (2011), “Bahrain Protests Throw Kingdom into Chaos”, NPR,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span> [Accessed July 19, 2011].<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1967340_1967342_1967406,00.htm">Singal, Jesse, Lim, Christine, and Stephey, M.J,&nbsp; “April 2003 Baghdad Falls”, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[15]</span>[Accessed July 19, 2011].</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17577#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iraq/elections/index.html">New York Times (2010), “Iraq Elections”, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span>[Accessed July 19, 2011].</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
