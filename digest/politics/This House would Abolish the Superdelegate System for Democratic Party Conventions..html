    <h1 class="print-title">This House would Abolish the Superdelegate System for Democratic Party Conventions.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The so-called superdelegates are senior members of the US Democratic Party who have an automatic right to attend and vote at the party&rsquo;s convention to select their presidential and vice-presidential candidates. These are former presidents, current senators, representatives and members of the Democratic National Committee.<a href="/print/18379#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> Speaking broadly, supporters of the system say that it injects welcome expertise into the process while critics say that it is simply undemocratic.</p>
<p>By way of context, it ties into the primary system where ordinary party members express their support for one candidate or another on a state by state basis. In turn the state parties then send delegates to their party&rsquo;s nominating convention where they are bound to vote in accordance with the wishes of the party members in their state. Superdelegates, by contrast, are not bound in terms of who they vote for and are free to choose. Both sides of this debate accept the fact that this gives disproportionate influence to party elders and much the debate revolves around whether that is a good thing or not. Although some of the superdelegates are unpledged state delegates (established on a predetermined basis before the start of the primary campaign), the vast majority fall into the category of PLEOs &ndash; the senior party figures. The ratio of the two groups voting power is roughly one to ten.</p>
<p>Comparing the voting power of superdelegates to that of an ordinary party member the ratio works out at about 1:10,000. In the light of this, clearly Proposition has a strong argument in the simple fact that the system undermines the principal of one person, one vote and there is little Op can do to deny that. Instead Op needs to demonstrate the system is not meant to work like that and that the superdelegates fulfill another role. For example in the build up to the Obama/Clinton convention it was widely suspected that the convention could come out to a dead heat between the two and that superdelegates could be used to break that deadlock. Opponents say that such action would be redolent of Gore/Bush decision being thrown into the Supreme court rather than allowing it to be decided by the voters.</p>
<p>The only convention where the result has actually been decided by super-delegates was the selection of Walter Mondale to run against Ronald Reagan in 1984. Mondale went down to a massive defeat as Reagan swept the board. Some have suggested that Mondale lacked legitimacy in the eyes of the electorate and that contributed to his defeat. Others would argue that since Mondale had a slight edge over his rival Gary Hart, superdelegates were simply following the popular vote. Conversely in 1968 &ndash; before the superdelegate system was introduced, big party bosses handed the nomination to Hubert Humphrey despite the fact he had not won a single primary.</p>
<p>Perhaps interestingly in 2008, Mondale, himself a superdelegate, voted for Clinton.</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s simply a violation of basic democratic principles for one vote to be worth more than another. There have been plenty of other attempts to restrict the rights of party members and activists to select candidates by party insiders keen to sew up the selection without members being consulted, super-delegates were created as a watered down response to one of these but the effects are the same<a href="/print/18379#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of how votes are actually cast it gives a very poor appearance a sends a bad message for a major party &ndash; especially one called the Democratic Party&nbsp; - to be justifying such a situation.</p>

                    <p>Primaries are a process of selection, not one of election. There are plenty of other situations in which political parties recognise the need to introduce particular expertise into their processes such as in drafting policy or developing campaign materials.</p>
<p>Superdelegates act as a balancing mechanism in the event of an emergency or a tie. Other than that the system simply ensures that the winning candidate has a clear majority and to provide the leadership with the party a legitimate reason to attend and show their support to those watching at home.</p>
<p>Rather than providing an unwatchable parade of faces and names that the electorate has never heard of the superdelegate system means that senior party officials have the opportunity to say that they have actively and publically voted for the successful candidate.</p>

                    <p>The influence of superdelegates acts as a vehicle for an elite that needs little help. The situation in which the superdelegates would be most likely to act were as the result of the membership of the party selecting someone from outside the political class or their friends in business. It was worried that this might happen in 1998 in the close primary contest between Clinton and Obama.<a href="/print/18379#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p>
<p>There is no reason that this decision should not be left to the members, it is after their party and they should be represented by whosoever they see fit. The decision in a democracy over the governance of the country &ndash; or the leadership of the party &ndash; should be determined by the populous or the members.</p>
<p>Allowing a disproportionate influence to past leaders and those they have selected inevitably discourages new ideas and new voices.</p>

                    <p>The suggestion that superdelegates vote for one of their own are simply disproved by the selection of Obama over one half of the most influential couple in the entire party.<a href="/print/18379#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> Obama drew his support from the grassroots and his funding and that was quite sufficient.</p>
<p>There is simply no evidence that the superdelegates act as a drag on the party, indeed they have consistently followed the popular decision of party activists and respected that decision. Indeed the Republican system, without superdelegates, have most recently selected George Bush followed by John McCain; it would be difficult to think of two candidates who would more accurately fit either of the descriptions &ldquo;old, powerful, white men&rdquo; or &ldquo;party establishment&rdquo;.</p>

                    <p>Superdelegates, as many are senators, representatives or officials in the states, often have their own reelection campaigns to secure and as a result their votes can be up for negotiation or go to which candidate will be best for their own reelection chances rather than in the best interests of the party. Presidential candidates are often prepared to make concessions to superdelegates to secure their support. There is public acknowledgement of the fact that this process takes place and the fact that they are not obliged to support the candidate designated by their state parties gives them enormous bargaining power. For example in 2008 several Democratic Representatives of Ohio formed a &lsquo;Protect American Jobs&rsquo; pact to hold back from endorsements until a candidate addresses issues of importance to the Ohio economy.<a href="/print/18379#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p>
<p>The system of superdelegates simply extends the pork-barrel buffet into the convention. With votes to be bought through offer of jobs or political support, the political process is distorted and corrupted<a href="/print/18379#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>.</p>

                    <p>Overwhelmingly senior party figures have publically declared for a candidate and the suggestion that this does not involve a degree of horse trading is simply naïve. Equally the suggestion that leaving such negotiations until after the election is over would be reckless in the extreme.</p>
<p>For anyone seeking reelection their most likely request is the candidates involvement in their campaign. In terms of cash donations the amounts concerned are tiny - Obama donated under a million to election campaigns and Clinton less than half of that, it doesn&rsquo;t seem unreasonable that someone wanting to lead the party into an election campaign should deploy some of their own funds to help get a congress they can work with.</p>

                    <p>The superdelegates are really a valve to deal with the unexpected. Even in the most contentious case of Walter Mondale &ndash; in reality only contentious because it was the first time the system had been used &ndash; the party had already decided and the superdelegates were just ensuring a clear majority.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario in which a candidate had won the popular vote only to face a major scandal on the eve of the convention. The role of those electors with a free hand would suddenly look very useful to party members.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>In such a scenario &ndash; which is a little concerned &ndash; it can be assumed that exactly the same party elders could be relied on to pressure the candidate to resign.</p>
<p>Equally the only &lsquo;crisis&rsquo; it is conceivable to imagine after months of primaries being raked over by the press and political opponents would seem to be that party grandees considered that the voters had made &lsquo;the wrong choice&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The reason that the Mondale case was contentious was that he wanted &ndash; and had wanted for some time &ndash; the party apparatus to have an even greater say but this was the best he could get. It also gives the lie to the party &lsquo;experts&rsquo; capacity to ensure winning candidates are selected.</p>

                    <p>There is absolutely no reason for the party leadership not to be invited &ndash; and to speak &ndash; without being given a vote. Every other party manages to do so.</p>
<p>Working on the basis that Bill Clinton managed to get an invite to &ndash; and address &ndash; the British Labour party (with Kevin Spacey as his sidekick) in 2002,<a href="/print/18379#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> it seems unlikely that Democrat party managers would forget to give him an invite.</p>
<p>Indeed the fact that the parties great and good have already had an influence over the outcome of the nomination in terms of giving their support and appearing on the campaign trail with candidates to give them an extra say at this late stage seems doubly unfair.</p>

                    <p>It is a standing joke in both parties that to win the nomination candidates need to run to the extreme and then, to win the election, run back to the middle. The very fact that this disparity exists suggests that having a stop button of people who have actually won some elections because, by definition, they have an understanding of the electorate might not be a bad idea.</p>
<p>In essence the superdelegates act as what in parliamentary terms as a reviewing chamber, rarely used but useful in a crisis.<a href="/print/18379#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p>

                    <p>The very fact that the only time since its creation when the superdelegates played a significant role, they managed to select the most unelectable candidate in modern American history &ndash; and by their involvement made him, more unelectable still suggests that the system may not be working.</p>
<p>Their intervention in 1984 to nudge Mondale over the winning line produced a candidate who lost in 49 states. If ever there were a situation when the party elders subtle understanding of the electorate might have been useful then it was at that election.</p>
<p>Instead they supported the party insider with a mechanism he had helped design and for exactly the purpose he had wanted it in place.</p>
