    <h1 class="print-title">This house would maintain the ban on nuclear weapons testing</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) outlaws the testing of nuclear weapons (United Nations, 1996). So far, 175 countries signed the treaty, but it cannot become a binding international law until it has been ratified by all states capable of developing nuclear weapons, of which there are 44 specified in the treaty. Of these states, three (India, Pakistan and North Korea) have not signed the treaty, and a further six (China, Egypt, Israel, Iran, and the United States) are yet to ratify it (Preparatory Commission, 2010). The United States signed the treaty in 1996, as soon as the language was agreed upon, but the Senate rejected it by a tiny margin. While the idea of the CTBT is quite simple, implementation is immensely complex. One of the greatest concerns of the treaty, and of the international community, is with monitoring countries so as to verify their compliance with the ban. To this end the treaty sets up the International Monitoring System (IMS), a network of hundreds of scientific facilities spread across the globe which monitor seismic activity, radioactive fallout, atmospheric noise and oceanic waves to pick up evidence of a nuclear explosion. If the IMS detects a suspected nuclear test then an on-site inspection can follow. The treaty does not detail the action that would be taken against a state that has broken the treaty, but the Charter of the United Nations does empower the Security Council to take &quot;appropriate steps&quot;. Although the treaty has not yet come into force, most of the IMS is now in place and working. Debates about the CTBT revolve around the efficacy of the treaty to prevent nuclear testing, and whether it is in the interest of nuclear-capable, and would-be nuclear-capable, states to agree to it.</p>

                    <p>There are a number of technological developments that will make the use of conventional weapons ineffective in combating certain threats. For example, some bunkers are now designed to be buried so deep underground that conventional bombing cannot penetrate them. Weapons such as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), currently in development in the United States, would be able to penetrate such bunkers, while leaving no more surface damage than a conventional bomb<sup>1</sup>. Deployment of a weapon such as the RNEP might prove necessary in order to stop proliferation of nuclear weapons in rogue states, as for example, Iran has built extremely tough bunkers for the purpose of nuclear testing. Blocking the development of necessary tactical nuclear technologies actually raises the chances of these dangerous states obtaining nuclear weapons. Another instance of tactical nuclear devices proving useful is in the destruction of clandestine biological and chemical weapons factories. Were such facilities destroyed by conventional bombing, some of the materials being manufactured could easily leak into neighboring population areas, leading to untold deaths. These new uses for nuclear weapons must, however, be tested before they can be deployed. The CTBT blocks all hope of developing such useful, and potentially lifesaving weapons.<br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/nuclear_weapons/technical_issues/nuclear-bunker-buster-rnep-animation.html"> Union of Concerned Scientists. 2005.

                    <p>Tactical nuclear weapons are a huge risk to world security, as their use can escalate conflicts into full-scale nuclear war<sup>1</sup>. Their development should thus rightly be restricted. Furthermore, developments in conventional weapons can serve the same purposes, if with slightly greater difficulty. New super bunker-buster bombs are in development in the United States that do not carry a nuclear payload, and fuel-air bombs can, with their wide incendiary range, destroy factories and any incinerate any hazardous materials quite effectively. New nuclear weapons are not necessary for the tactical concerns of the future.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.hsfk.de/index.php?id=9&amp;no_cache=0&amp;detail=3124&amp;cHash=0991198fec&amp;L=1">Muller, Harald and Stephanie Sohnius. 2005.

                    <p>Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons ever created, it is right that they should be limited; something that the test ban treaty will be a step towards. An internationally ratified Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on the testing of nuclear weapons would serve to hamper attempts by countries currently not in possession of nuclear weapons from acquiring them<sup>1</sup>. Of course, a country could still develop a nuclear weapon without testing, but little faith can be put in a weapon that is entirely untested; all countries that currently possess nuclear weapons conducted tests. A comprehensive and internationally ratified treaty against testing would serve as an important signaling device to countries considering developing nuclear weapons. Just as a taboo has formed around the use of nuclear weapons due to international accords denouncing their use, so too would a ban on testing generate a norm against it. Countries rely on their reputations in international relations; states will fear loss of credibility should they be seen flouting the ban, either by testing weapons themselves or by supplying materials to countries seeking to perform tests. Furthermore, fear of sanction by other countries and the United Nations will prevent states from engaging in nuclear tests for fear of economic and political damage incurred there from.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/50/ares50- 45.htm">United Nations General Assembly. 1996.

                    <p>International law is often worth little more than the paper it is written on. If countries want to develop and test nuclear weapons, they will do so irrespective of a ban. Not many countries want nuclear weapons at all, and those that do are often not the friendliest players in the international arena. In North Korea, for example, the government cares little for international accords and has made a habit of ignoring sanctions against it. A ban will have no effect on stopping a state developing and testing nuclear weapons if it feels it needs them.</p>        </div>

There has actually been significant progress toward nuclear disarmament in recent years, most notably the New Start between the United States and Russia, which pledges to reduce both countries number of strategic missile launchers by half (Associated Press, 2011). Countries should not be concerning themselves with updating their outdated arsenals, but with making stronger steps toward disarmament.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-02-05-start-treaty_N.htm">Associated Press. 2011.

                    <p>Scanning and detection technology has become so advanced in recent years that it is virtually impossible for a country to detonate a nuclear device without it being detected. Compliance with the treaty can be monitored through the means of seismology, hydroacoustics, infrasound, and radionuclide monitoring. The technologies are used to monitor the underground, the waters and the atmosphere for any sign of a nuclear explosion. The monitoring network consists of 337 facilities located across the world. The system is so sensitive that it was able to detect the disintegration of the space shuttle Columbia. Furthermore, the treaty's system of inspection will reveal any suspicious activity regarding testing.<sup>1</sup> Clearly, efficacy in terms of determining who might be testing weapons is not an issue. When countries are found to be violating the CTBT, heavy political and economic sanctions can be imposed which will serve to force countries back into compliance with the treaty.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/50/ares50-45.htm">United Nations General Assembly. 1996.

                    <p>There is still a great deal of speculation on the ability of the detectors to spot nuclear tests occurring, particularly in underground facilities. If such tests are shielded, then the treaty can be flouted without fear of discovery. Regardless, even if it is true that tests can be detected with relative ease, the threat of sanctions is not as powerful as its proponents suppose. Rather, many countries are perfectly willing to endure heavy sanctions without acquiescing to international demands. Such has been the case in both Iran and North Korea, which have pursued their nuclear ambitions with little regard to the will of the international community. The CTBT, no matter how vocally defended, will not shape the behavior of states that want nuclear weapons.</p>        </div>

                    <p>States are universally recognized as having the right to defend themselves, and this right must extend to the possession of nuclear weapons, and the ability to test them. Often states lack the capacity to defend themselves with conventional weapons. This is particularly true of poor and small states. Even wealthy, small states are susceptible to foreign attack, since their wealth cannot make up for their lack of manpower. With a nuclear deterrent, all states become equal in terms of ability to do harm to one another<sup>1</sup>. If a large state attempts to intimidate, or even invade a smaller neighbor, it will be unable to effectively cow it, since the small state will have the power to grievously wound, or even destroy, the would-be invader with a few well-placed nuclear missiles<sup>2</sup>. An example of this is the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008, which would likely never have occurred had Georgia been armed with nuclear weapons, as Russia would have thought twice when considering the potential loss of several of its cities it would need to exchange for a small piece of Georgian territory. Clearly, nuclear weapons serve in many ways to equalize states irrespective of size, allowing them to more effectively defend themselves. Furthermore, countries will only use nuclear weapons in the event of existential threat. This is why, for example, North Korea has not used nuclear weapons; for it, like all other states, survival is the order of the day, and using nuclear weapons aggressively would spell its certain destruction<sup>3</sup>. Nuclear testing is thus imperative in this context, due to the fact that it very difficult to obtain nuclear weapons other than to develop them oneself, the result largely of anti-proliferation treaties designed to maintain the status quo.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57069/robert-jervis/weapons-without-purpose-nuclear-strategy-in-the-post-cold-war-era">Jervis, Robert. 2001.

                    <p>While states should of course have the right to defend themselves, this does not extend to the possession and testing of nuclear weapons. Just as biological and chemical weapons are banned by international treaty, so too has the international community generally acknowledged that nuclear proliferation is negative, which is why so many treaties are dedicated to non-proliferation<sup>1</sup>. Recognition of the CTBT will help serve to prevent proliferation by stopping the testing of new nuclear weapons. It is unfortunate that nuclear weapons exist, even more so that a few countries are still seeking to develop them. It is better to fight this movement, to keep nuclear weapons in as few hands as possible so as to prevent their development, testing, and use by rogue states, terrorists, and other dangers to international security.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/issue/67/nuclear-weapons">Shah, Anup. 2009.

                    <p>Some countries have been reticent to sign the CTBT for fear it would limit their ability to either expand or to begin their nuclear arsenals. The United States stands as one of the only such non-signers, in the company of such countries as Iran, China, and North Korea. The United States fears the limiting of the ability for it to defend itself with nuclear armament. However, in reality the United States will benefit politically and militarily by signing, and the world will be benefited by a greater chance for peace without nuclear proliferation<sup>1</sup>. American accession would benefit the US politically by increasing its credibility as a responsible international player with a respect for international law. Often the US is viewed by the rest of the world as a cowboy pursuing its own aims and only paying lip service to the international community's opinion. If the US were to show a degree of respect to international law, particularly through signing CTBT, it will be more able to gain support from other countries for its goals. Also, if the US signs, it will encourage other states to sign, such as China, which has said that its signature is contingent upon that of the US. US involvement in the CTBT, and the Chinese involvement expected to follow from it, will give the treaty far greater weight, and will generate greater obedience toward it, as countries recognize that it is binding on all states, not just the weak. Furthermore, from a military standpoint, the US has nothing to lose from signing as it may still retain its present nuclear stockpiles, as well as to develop new delivery and guidance systems, provided they are not tested with live nuclear warheads. Also, it has much to gain, as the ratification of the treaty will prevent other states from developing nuclear weapons, keeping the club of nuclear powers small and influential. Clearly, it is in the interest of the United States to sign the treaty, in order to benefit not only itself, but also the international community.<br><sup>1</sup> Shah, Anup. 2009. "Nuclear Weapons".

                    <p>The United States bending the knee to the CTBT would do nothing to stop the countries currently seeking to develop nuclear weapons from doing so. Those countries have often made a habit of ignoring international sanctions, and the participation of the US will do little to change their behavior with regard to nuclear armament. Countries often develop nuclear weapons due to local strategic concerns that are largely unaffected by the US's acquiescence to international law or otherwise. In the case of Israel, for example, its choice to sign the treaty will depend entirely on Iran's attitude toward developing nuclear weapons. Furthermore, it may not be in the US's strategic interest to sign the treaty, as allowing itself to be seen as bound by international law might be perceived as a sign of weakness by potential rivals.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Nuclear weapons tests release vast quantities of radiation into the atmosphere, contaminating water supplies, soil, and harming human, plant, and animal health irreparably. The bomb tests conducted by the United States between 1951 and 1963, for example, released 148 times the radioactivity of the Chernobyl disaster<sup>1</sup>. Radioactivity released by Russian tests in the 1950s and 1960s are estimated to have released even greater amounts of radiation. It is estimated that 2.4 million people currently living will die due to cancers caused by radioactivity generated by nuclear testing. The genetic damage created by nuclear tests has killed, and will kill many innocent people. Accidents can also occur, as in the United States when an accident in 1954 saw inhabitants of towns near a test site blanketed in the radioactive plume. Such horrors cannot be allowed to continue, but would be all the more likely in poorer countries trying to test weapons. Furthermore, nuclear testing has done untold damage to the environment and ecosystems around the world. In the Pacific, for example, hydrogen bomb testing destroyed whole ecologies. Even when tested underground nuclear weapons are dangerous to the environment, with radiation seeping out of test sites at half of all such tests<sup>2</sup>. It is imperative that the environmentally devastating effects of these weapons not be allowed to continue through testing.<br><sup>1</sup> Costandina, Titus. 2001.

                    <p>Every country has a right to self-defense, which includes access to a nuclear deterrent. If advanced countries are concerned about nuclear testing they could provide the technology to budding nuclear powers so that they can be safer in their construction and testing of nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the damage supposedly caused by nuclear fallout is not so great as to deny the fundamental right to self-defense. Some ecosystems may be damaged and some areas may suffer higher radiation levels, but it will not be so bad as to significantly reduce the quality of life of people within the countries conducting nuclear tests or that of their neighbours.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Nuclear capability has served as a sign of being a player on the world stage since they were first developed. After the initial development of the technology, Russia quickly built its own. Following suit, the United Kingdom, France, and China all built their own independent nuclear deterrents. It is not surprising that it was these first nuclear powers that also form the permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council. Nuclear capability means power and influence, something many developing and emerging powers aspire to<sup>1</sup>. Effectively denying the ability of some states to develop nuclear weapons, just because they were too late to emerge as major actors on the world stage is to freeze the international system in place, preventing new powers from taking their place at the forefront of the congress of nations. By developing nuclear weapons, countries demonstrate a mastery of a very complicated science, showing they are capable of interacting on a level playing field with more mature powers<sup>2</sup>. It is best to allow countries to emerge peacefully, and for them to be able to show their capacity than to try to keep the international system static.

                    <p>A ban on nuclear testing is almost universally desired in virtually every country, with the exception of a few rogue states, such as North Korea. Even in the United States, which has been reticent to sign, the popular opinion is overwhelmingly in favor of the ban<sup>1</sup>. There is a very strong political impetus to enact a ban, and actually doing so would show that the international community could actually agree upon something. It is difficult to make the case that international cooperation will accomplish anything regarding contentious issues when it cannot even act on one that has universal support virtually everywhere.

                    <p>The vast majority of people may support a ban, but that will not stop rogue states from developing and testing nuclear weapons any more than signing the CTBT will.

Furthermore, there is a potential harm in signing the treaty, in that people might actually believe that the ratification of CTBT accomplished something, and would suppose that countries seeking nuclear weapons would actually be deterred from doing so.

                    <p>The CTBT, like most international treaties, is worth little more than the paper it is written on. It may deter more peaceful-minded countries from considering testing nuclear weapons, though such countries were unlikely to do so in the absence of the treaty anyway. The countries actively seeking nuclear weapons at present are already very isolated from the international community, or are in the midst of what they consider to be a fight for their very existence. These beliefs are held in Iran, for example, which views the United States as a very real threat to its sovereignty and a nuclear deterrent as instrumental in protecting itself from either a direct American attack, or a US-sponsored attack by Israel. Iran has been subjected for year to trade sanctions, yet it soldiers on. The power to enforce the treaty is thus non-existent<sup>1</sup>. Furthermore, because there is no mandatory sanctioning clause in the CTBT, there is a real chance that the UN Security Council would not even implement a punishment against a violator of the treaty.<br><sup>1</sup> Bailey, Kathleen and Robert Barker. 2003.

Furthermore, if some countries will not stop developing nuclear programs, further methods should be taken against them, and such actions would likely garner greater international support if the treaty is ratified into international law.</p>        </div>
