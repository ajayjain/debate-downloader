    <div class="print-content"><p>Most democratic constitutions make some provision for the use of referendums – a public vote which asks the electorate its opinion on a specific proposal to change the law or constitution – to consult citizens on matters considered to be of special importance. However, with a few exceptions, most nations use this power extremely infrequently.</p><p>Supporters of referendums believe that they are a thoroughly good idea; they return power to the hands of the people, increase engagement with politics, and ensure that everyone’s views are represented in the political debate. But opponents argue that increased use of referendums would not improve decision-making; on the contrary, they say, putting too many questions before the public in referendums leads to short-term policymaking, turns complex, nuanced debates into simplistic campaigns between slogan-wielding factions, and would just irritate voters who are already fed up of politics.</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

                    <p>Governments exist to serve the will of the people, not the other way round; politicians take their instructions from their constituents, or should do. But in the modern state this relationship is often inverted. By obliging our democratic institutions to take genuine account of public opinion, and returning real political power back to those to whom it rightly belongs – the people – we can put the relationship between the individual and the state back on a healthier footing. In principle, people should have the right to decide for themselves on matters of importance to their lives. <a href="/print/18101#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/18101#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> .

                    <p>The public already has an effective veto on legislation, and retains the ultimate power over a politician’s career through its vote at general elections. When governments break their promises, or govern contrary to the preferences of their voters, they are punished by being ejected from office at the subsequent election.

                    <p>In the past, it was impractical to organise frequent referendums due to the difficulty and expense of holding them. But with the advent of the internet and mass media, it is now easier than ever to consult the public on issues of concern to them. For example, Switzerland regularly holds referendums on all sorts of issues in an efficient manner which commands widespread public support. <a href="/print/18101#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/18101#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Gerlach, Jan; Gasser, Urs. “Three Case Studies from Switzerland: E-Voting”, <em>Internet and Democracy Case Study Series</em>, March 2009. <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/Gerlach-Gasser_SwissCases_Evoting.pdf">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/Gerlach-Gasser_SwissCases_Evoting.pdf</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

Just because we can consult the public more easily nowadays, that is no reason to destroy a system that has generally served us well for decades and, in some cases, centuries.</p><p>Furthermore, electronic voting is still in its infancy, and liable to fraud and technical problems. <a href="/print/18101#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/18101#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> ”E-Voting Rights”, <em>Electronic Frontier Foundation</em>. <a href="http://www.eff.org/issues/e-voting">http://www.eff.org/issues/e-voting</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>People are apathetic about politics because they only get to vote once every few years. Even then it is not directly for policies but for competing political parties who promise to implement them (but often reverse position when in office). They feel that politicians do not listen to them between elections, and disengagement with the political process grows and grows. More frequent referendums would stimulate interest in politics because people would actually get a say in decisions. For example, evidence from the US shows that states with frequent use of ballot initiatives tend to have higher voter participation in elections. <a href="/print/18101#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/18101#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Tolbert, Caroline; Grummel, John; Smith, Daniel. “The Effect of Ballot Initiatives on Voter Turnout in the American States”. <em>American Politics Research</em> Vol. 29 No. 6, November 2001. <a href="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/dasmith/apr.pdf">http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/dasmith/apr.pdf</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Most people are apathetic about politics because they find it dull or do not believe that it affects them. This may be regrettable but it is hard to see how increasing the number of votes they are asked to participate in will have a positive effect on this trend. On the contrary, many of those who do not like politics will quickly become even more bored and irritated if they are constantly bombarded with campaign literature, television adverts and activists ringing on their doorbells.</p>        </div>

                    <p>If none of the parties support a policy it is probably because it has no significant support among the people! Much of modern politics is reactive; policies are tested by focus groups and carefully crafted to appeal to as many potential voters as possible. People may tell pollsters that they favour a particular policy (such as the reinstatement of the death penalty in the example from the Proposition side), but that does not necessarily mean that there is a grounds well of support for changing the law.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is right that once the people have given it a mandate it should be able to carry out legislation with long term aims. Often good legislation is unpopular at first, but effective and popular in the long run. Such legislation would never survive a referendum. It is only fair that the government is given a chance to see if its legislation does indeed work. The people can then vote the government out of office if it fails.</p><p>Similarly, it is government’s job to lead and not to follow, especially on social legislation.

                    <p>It is true that a responsible government should draft legislation with a view to its long term benefits. However, many governments do not do this; programmes are often set up, laws changed or taxes cut with a view to short term electoral benefit and narrow party political gain, not the good of the country. Arguably, the electorate are more likely to vote on issues for the “right” reasons than are their elected representatives.</p><p>Saying that government should lead public opinion, rather than follow it, is simply another way of saying that the state should ignore the will of the public. It is hard to see how it can be justified for governments to pass laws which they know do not command public support. Clearly there may be exceptions in extreme situations - such as the abolition of slavery in the 19<sup>th</sup> century – but, broadly speaking, the citizens of a country should have the right to order their society in the way they think is best.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is possible to avoid freakish results by only allowing a referendum to be valid if a certain percentage of the population votes, say 30%.

There is no reason to think it would be hard to find a formula that avoids these sorts of problems.</p><p>It may be formally true that the same referendum question could be put to the public again and again, but the same can be said of any political question in the status quo. Once a referendum has been held on an issue, politicians are unlikely to risk the wrath of the electorate by making them vote on the same question repeatedly.</p>        </div>
