    <h1 class="print-title">This House would introduce recall elections.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>A recall election is a form of direct democracy in which citizens are able to cut short the term of an elected representative through a public vote. Particular mechanisms vary, but usually involve a petition signed by members of the public. If a sufficient proportion of the electorate signs the petition the recall process is triggered and a special election is called to decide whether the representative concerned should be removed from office. In some systems (e.g. Venezuela) this is essentially a straightforward referendum on the politician; if the recall initiative is passed then their office becomes vacant and a new election is held later to decide who should fill it. In other versions of the recall process (e.g the Philippines) , the incumbent is placed on a ballot alongside a number of challengers; if the current representative receives the most votes they keep their office, but if someone else gains more votes than they do, they are lose office and are replaced by the successful challenger. In California a two-part ballot requires voters first to decide on whether the incumbent should be dismissed, and then to vote for a replacement should the first question be passed<a href="/print/17800#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Recall procedures are used in a small number of countries. 36 states in the USA allow recall votes for county or city officials, but only 18 have provisions to recall state legislators or governors (recalls are not used for federal positions). Only two US governors have ever been recalled, the most recent being Gray Davis of California who was removed from office in 2003 and replaced by Arnold Schwarzenegger.<a href="/print/17800#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Parts of Switzerland and British Columbia in Canada also have recall mechanisms, as do Venezuela and the Philippines. In 2009 a House of Commons expenses scandal in the United Kingdom tarnished the reputation of many British Members of Parliament, and led to calls for recall mechanisms to be introduced. Because the exact nature of recall systems varies widely from place to place, the Proposition should devote some thought to defining what kind of mechanism they would put in place. Nonetheless, it is important to argue the debate on the basis of broad principles that apply to all recall systems; the arguments below should apply in almost all cases. Note that as recall votes are a form of direct democracy, many of the wider arguments that are used in debates about referendums and initiatives also apply here.</p><p>The law may require a certain percentage of adult citizens to sign a petition to trigger a recall (3%-7% in Switzerland, depending on the canton) or a certain percentage of the number of votes cast in the election of the incumbent (as in California, which requires 12%). The mechanism can demand the removal of office in one ballot and the appointment of the next politician in a separate one. Additionally, the laws may differ in the conditions they place on someone’s running for office.</p><div><a href="/print/17800#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> California Constitution, Article II. <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_2">http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_2</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17800#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> The States’ Liberty Party California Recall Info Page. <a href="http://www.liberty-ca.org/recallgraydavis/">http://www.liberty-ca.org/recallgraydavis/</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>Elections only come around every four years or so, allowing unethical or incompetent politicians to do a lot of damage in office before facing the judgment of their constituents. And after three years or so, many voters may have forgotten about their offending behavior, allowing them to get away with it. In any case, regular elections seldom focus on the record of one particular candidate for a legislature, but are a referendum on their party as a whole. If their party remains popular, or if their seat is a safe one, then incompetent and unethical politicians will often be re-elected regardless of their personal failings. Such was the case in California, where immediately before the recall, Gray Davis (a Democrat) was re-elected simply because the local Republican Party had self-destructed.<a href="/print/17800#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17800#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> “Democracy as chaos” 07.08.2003 <em>The Economist</em> – accessed on 21.08.2011 http://www.economist.com/node/1974493?story_id=E1_TJSQQJP</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>In reality, most recall votes in systems where they are allowed come down to judgments about policy decisions. In 2003 no one accused Gray Davis of being personally corrupt or mentally incapable of wielding power. Davis was ejected as Governor of California because voters didn’t like the way he had handled power-utilities and tried to solve the state’s debt problems. Not only should Davis have been allowed to serve out his term so that voters could judge him on the long-term success of his policies in these areas; the struggles of his successor as Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, with much the same set of problems suggest that getting rid of Davis did little to address the underlying problems facing California.</p>        </div>

                    <p>People today are apathetic and distrustful about politics, which is very unhealthy for a democracy. Low turnouts in elections mean that governments today lack moral authority. Giving people more direct control would create more interest in politics, and get more people educated and active about the issues that affect them. In other words, allowing recall elections will help to restore faith in politics and encourage active citizenship. Enabling ordinary voters to sack unsatisfactory representatives will give them an incentive to monitor what their politicians are doing in office, and will encourage the media to cover legislative affairs more fully than they do at present.<a href="/print/17800#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17800#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Goldsmith, Zac. “My Surefire cure for voter apathy.”2 July 2009.&nbsp; http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23714689-my-surefire-cure-for-voter-apathy.do</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Having a recall mechanism focuses the minds of elected representatives and ensures that they keep the interests of their constituents constantly in mind. Not only will this lead to harder working politicians with higher ethical standards, it will also prevent them selling out to lobby groups and party whips. All too often elected representatives give way to the lure of “business as usual” in the capital city, and forget the folks who sent them there in the first place. A system which provides the opportunity for a recall will give voters more power than what they currently have – cast a ballot once every four or five years. For the reasons outlined above, i.e. that voters may simply lack quality of choice in election time, giving them the ability to demand a recall decreases the democratic deficit<a href="/print/17800#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p><div><a href="/print/17800#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Government Accountablity Board: State of Wisconsin. <a href="http://gab.wi.gov/elections-voting/2011/recall/july-19">http://gab.wi.gov/elections-voting/2011/recall/july-19</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The overwhelming numbers of elected representatives at every level already keep the concerns of their constituents constantly in mind, working very long hours in their interest. Recall systems are offensive as they imply that all politicians are crooks who need some kind of parole procedure. In addition, too much focus on very local interests can make politics very parochial and lead to too little consideration of the overall national interest, allowing small minorities to block necessary reforms and encouraging wasteful “pork barrel” spending. Finally, recall elections are not the only means to hold politicians to high standards of behavior; if they stray ethically they can already be punished by the courts, by impeachment, or by legislative ethics panels.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Recall systems undermine representative democracy, in which citizens choose elected representatives to take decisions on their behalf. Accountability is ensured by regular elections, but in between these citizens should trust their representatives to exercise their judgment responsibly. Many policies may require unpopular short-term pain (in the form of higher taxes, spending cuts, new laws that restrict personal behavior, etc), in order to achieve a longer-term benefit. For these reasons it is natural for voters to suffer “buyers’ remorse” but dangerous to allow them to act on it – politicians constantly looking over their shoulders in fear of recall petitions will never dare to undertake necessary but painful reforms. We should only judge representatives on their overall record after several years in power.<a href="/print/17800#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17800#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Wildermuth, John. “Dean, Davis say recall undermines democracy.” SF Gate. <a href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2003-09-07/news/17510490_1_recall-monterey-park-gray-davis">http://articles.sfgate.com/2003-09-07/news/17510490_1_recall-monterey-park-gray-davis</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The power of recall is an important part of a fully democratic system. If sovereignty is truly popular, then as much power as possible should reside with the people. Although they entrust power to legislators and members of the executive, if that trust is broken or abused there should be a mechanism to recall from office the offending politician. In this way politicians will not be able to get away with lying to the voters at election time (for example, about their qualifications or family circumstances), breaking campaign pledges (e.g. on cutting taxes), or acting unethically (e.g. fiddling their expenses) once in office<a href="/print/17800#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p><div><a href="/print/17800#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Tate, Mike. “Recall Elections Enhance Democracy.” US News: Politics. <a href="http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2011/05/10/recall-elections-enhance-democracy">http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2011/05/10/recall-elections-enhance-democracy</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Recall procedures can be very easily abused. In marginal seats they can just be a way for sore losers to try to overturn a valid election result, leading to permanent campaigning at the expense of good government. Powerful private interests, such as rich lobby groups or media magnates can use their influence to attack politicians they dislike, promoting recall petitions to advance their own agendas. Even where there is genuine popular feeling against a representative, the minority who dislike him or her are likely to be more highly motivated than those who don’t object to his/her behavior in office, which will distort any process based on obtaining signatures or turning out for a one-off vote without national implications.<a href="/print/17800#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17800#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Riemer, Daniel. “Governor Walker’s Adversaries emboldened by Wisconsin FBI Probe.”<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/sep/19/fbi-wisconsin-scott-walker">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/sep/19/fbi-wisconsin-scott-walker</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Recall elections need not be vulnerable to abuse. For a start, in a democracy we must trust the people - voters are not so stupid as to believe automatically the arguments of well-funded lobby groups. The history of recall elections in a range of countries shows that attempts to remove elected representatives are very uncommon, and that when they do occur most incumbents survive the process. Abuse can be prevented by requiring a larger proportion (often between 10 and 25%) of the electorate to sign a petition for a recall election to be held. Many recall systems also require the representative concerned to have been officially censured, either by the courts or by a legislative ethics committee of some sort.</p>        </div>

                    <p>As well as being unnecessary and dangerous, recall elections are also expensive. Holding a special vote means taxpayers’ money has to be spent on preparing the ballots, hiring halls, taking public employees away from their other duties, sending out information, etc. – the 2003 California vote cost $80 million just for campaigning<a href="/print/17800#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. And the very possibility of recall elections also requires a state permanently to maintain a larger electoral authority than would otherwise be necessary. In addition politicians will have to maintain permanent campaign funds in case they are challenged in a recall petition, leading them to spend time on unnecessary fund-raising rather than serving the public.</p><div><a href="/print/17800#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> “Tracking money in the California Recall Election” Winter 2003 <em>Nieman Reports</em> – accessed on 26.08.2011 http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=100932</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>If cost was our priority we would never hold elections at all – ultimately we have to be willing to pay the price of democracy. In a well-run system a recall election should not cost more than a few cents per voter – easily less than the bills unethical or incompetent politicians may run up at the public expense. In any case, most political systems have some sort of election most years (e.g. national, state, local council votes, referendums), so recall votes can be made to coincide with these scheduled ballots.</p>        </div>
