    <h1 class="print-title">This House Believes that the War in Iraq was Worth the Cost</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The war in Iraq is likely to be remembered for decades, if not centuries, as the defining conflict of the early 21<sup>st</sup> century. The effect it had not only in the nation and country itself in radicalizing an entire generation as well as the toxic effect it had on those politicians most closely associated with it may well stand as a legacy to how not to fight a war.</p><p>However, as the original reasons for going in fade into history – and they were never that clear in the first place – the issue of what has been accomplished becomes an interesting one. It would be foolish to assert that everything went according to plan, and proposition will have to demonstrate benefits from some unusual sources. However unlikely it may seem, such benefits do exist.</p><p>The first and most obvious one is that Saddam Hussein, and his genocidal regime, is no longer in power. Instead there is, by the standards of the region, a democratic, relatively stable and relatively transparent nation state. It may not be Switzerland but the difference between the country the allies entered and the one they are leaving could not be clearer.</p><p>Equally, although it will come as little consolation to the families of those who have died the knowledge gained about how wars in the 21<sup>st</sup> century need to be fought can be used to save lives in the future. Especially given the instability of the Middle East as a whole and the growing scarcity of oil, it seems unlikely that this is the last desert war the West will be fighting in the decades to come.</p><p>Equally, the impact it had on the West is instructive. When Britain and France chose to intervene in Libya, Sarkosy and Cameron did so in the shadow of Baghdad and the difference in their approach could not have been more different from the gung-ho, militaristic approach taken by Blair and Bush. Instead they adopted very clear goals, were very clear on the need for indigenous allies, and refused to put boots on the ground. It seems that they acknowledged that their electorates would not stomach another war conducted along the lines of Iraq.</p><p>It would stretch credulity to suggest that there is a direct link between the fall of Baghdad and the Arab Spring. However, that synchronicity of the two events may ultimately prove beneficial. The Middle East would have been a lonely place for a democratic state and now there are at least a handful to build upon.</p><p>Although the cost in lives – lost and broken – is almost too ghastly to contemplate and the effects on the economies of all concerned has been devastating, there are some positives that have come out of the conflict. Benefits that would not be available with Saddam left in power. The balance of probability now seems to be that the future generations living in a free and democratic Iraq will give thanks to those who died to start the nation on its long road to freedom.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-text field-field-debate-authors">

                    <p>It's important to be clear that this debate is looking at the results of the Iraq war and, by any definition Iraq is in a much more stable and secure position than it was in 2003 when American, British and other international troops arrived in the country.</p><p>Whatever one thinks of the initial justifications for the war there is no doubt that the country, the region and the world are better and safer places without Saddam Hussein<a href="/print/17934#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>.

                    <p>Without intervention there is little doubt that Saddam or one of his still more murderous sons would be running Iraq. Even though there were no WMDs, it seems reasonable to assume that neither Saddam nor his sons would have ignored Iran’s attempts to secure fissile material and develop a bomb. Iraq had attempted to build a nuclear reactor in the 1970’s but it was destroyed by Israel in 1981<a href="/print/17934#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> and Iraq and Iran had fought a far for most of the 1980s for political dominance in the Gulf and the Shi’ite, Sunni religious divide.<a href="/print/17934#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>So we would now be watching an arms race in the Middle East between the two with Israel on a hair trigger.</p><p>This wasn’t just about removing one tyrant; the regime had dynastic ambitions, and a failure to act would have created the equivalent of North Korea. However, this particular hermit kingdom would have been sitting on top of the second largest reserves of oil in the world. It would, therefore, have the capacity to create the sort of fear and chaos Kim Jong Il can only dream of.</p><div><a href="/print/17934#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/7/newsid_3014000/3014623.stm">BBC On This Day, ‘1981: Israel bombs Baghdad nuclear reactor’.</a><br><div id="edn2"><p><a href="/print/17934#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[ii]</a> <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/164/a-border-adrift-origins-of-the-iraq-iran-war">Pipes, Daniel, ‘A Border Adrift: Origins of the Iraq-Iran War’, <em>The Iraq-Iran War: Old Conflict, New Weapons</em>, 1983</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There is little evidence that the Ba’ath Party would have tolerated a handover of power to Saddam’s sons. Even in North Korea, the issue of Kim Il Sung’s succession became fraught, and hotly contested amongst the North Korean political elite.. However, the issue of who should run Iraq was and should remain a matter for the Iraqi people. The current puppet regime has little power outside <a>Baghdad</a> and, frankly, not that much inside, this lack of central control is as damaging as too much would be as is shown by the failure of Somalia and resulting civil war and piratical attacks.<a href="/print/17934#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p>In many ways the war has encouraged the world’s rogue states to pursue nuclear weapons as, in an era of ‘pre-emptive defense, they are the only surety against invasion and overthrow<a href="/print/17934#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>. Iran is continuing to persue nuclear weapons even without the threat of Iraq on its borders, instead it is worried about Israel and the United States. One more threatening state would therefore have made little difference.<a href="/print/17934#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a></p><p>If the aim of the war was to insure against future threats then leaving a nation bitter and resentful, where barely a family has not lost someone to the conflict, a radicalized younger generation, emboldened militant clerics and a weak central government seems a very strange way to go about doing it. The West will almost certainly have to return to Iraq within a generation, if not a decade.</p><div><a href="/print/17934#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/somalia/3479010/Somalia-Analysis-of-a-failed-state.html">Blair, David, ‘Somalia: Analysis of a failed state’, <em>The Telegraph</em>, 18 November 2008</a><br><div id="edn2"><p><a href="/print/17934#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[ii]</a> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121876047023242841.html">Francis Fukuyama. “Iraq May Be Stable, But The War Was Still A Mistake”.

                    <p>Events from the Arab Spring have demonstrated, more graphically than anything else could have done, that Arab peoples are more than capable of dealing with their own dictators and do not need to be patronized by fading imperial powers.</p><p>Imagine what the situation in Iraq would be now following a genuinely democratic uprising rather than the imposition of yet another puppet regime by the West. Since the creation of the state of Iraq as a modern state by the British in 1932, a succession of rulers, of various stripes of dictatorial ruthlessness, have been brought in to ensure that the oil wealth continues to flow to Washington, London and other foreign capitals.</p><p>The allies were never interested in Iraqi freedom, this was yet another grab for oil and the results look set to be the same round of misery and tyranny for the people of Iraq.</p>        </div>
