    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes European NATO member governments should significantly reduce their armed forces</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>NATO is an alliance of 28 states from Europe and North America.<a href="/print/17651#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It was founded in 1949 at the start of the Cold War to provide for the collective defense of its members, and for much of its history was focused on the military threat posed by the forces of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. Since the end of the Cold War in 1989, the direct military threat to NATO&rsquo;s European member states has substantially diminished and NATO has transformed itself to additionally include crisis management beyond its borders and collective security amongst its tasks. This requires substantial investment by its member states to modernize their armed forces to be deployable and sustainable overseas. More recently, the long term effects of the global financial crisis have underlined the strain that defense expenditure puts on the governments of the member states. And, under the terms of NATO&rsquo;s Treaty, its European member states should still be able to expect military assistance from the United States and Canada in the event of an attack.&nbsp; Should NATO&rsquo;s European members reduce their armed forces?</p>

                    <p>The threat of a direct military attack on the European member states is very remote. As NATO’s new strategic concept acknowledges: “Today, the Euro-Atlantic area is at peace and the threat of a conventional attack against NATO territory is low.”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>NATO troops are involved only in crises abroad, such as the war in Afghanistan and NATO’s intervention in Libya. These operations do not affect the security of the member states – they have no need to maintain expensive armed forces to fight such ‘wars of choice’ or to help others when there are problems at home.&nbsp; Further, the money that the member states spend participating in such operations could be better spent on things that would really help in these regions – such as development aid.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> “Strategic Concept For the Defence and Security of The Members of the North Atlantic Treaty&nbsp;Organisation,” <u>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</u>, November 2010, <a href="http://www.nato.int/lisbon2010/strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf">http://www.nato.int/lisbon2010/strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span>.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Even though the threat of direct military attack is low, there is no guarantee that it will remain so.&nbsp; Armed forces act as an insurance policy against the emergence of a future threat. Once they have been reduced, they cannot be rapidly reconstituted as recruiting and training personnel, and purchasing or manufacturing arms are long term processes. Effective armed forces cannot simply be conjured into existence.&nbsp; Further, the threat of military attack is low because, in part, Europe’s armed forces deter such a threat.&nbsp; NATO’s new strategic concept acknowledges this: “[Peace in Europe] is an historic success for the policies of robust defence, Euro-Atlantic integration and active partnership that have guided NATO for more than half a century.”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Reducing Europe’s armed forces would weaken this deterrent.</p><p>In a globalized world, instability anywhere affects our own security and way of life.&nbsp; As Canada, a NATO member state, notes: “Globalization means that developments abroad can have a profound impact on the safety and interests of Canadians at home. Indeed, the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001 and those carried out since, demonstrate how instability and state failure in distant lands can directly affect our own security and that of our allies.”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Our own security depends on our ability to prevent and stop conflicts abroad, provide stability, protect trade routes and so on. Further, the plights of people in need in places such as Libya, or those suffering from natural disasters, cannot simply be disregarded. NATO’s European member states have an ethical duty to maintain forces to help people in need.&nbsp; The capabilities to support such operations, and to deploy and sustain troops in distant lands are expensive in terms of both people and budgets – there is no case for reducing Europe’s armed forces or cutting defense expenditure.&nbsp; Finally, although NATO members may spend a lot maintaining forces for intervention operations, there is no guarantee that other ways of spending money would be more effective in achieving the same goals.&nbsp; After all, no development can take place without the basic stability that NATO forces provide in conflict zones.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;“Strategic Concept For the Defence and Security of The Members of the North Atlantic Treaty&nbsp;Organisation,”&nbsp;<u>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</u>, November 2010,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nato.int/lisbon2010/strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf">http://www.nato.int/lisbon2010/strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span>.</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> “Strategic environment,” <u>Department of National Defense (Canada)</u>, <a href="http://forces.gc.ca/site/pri/first-premier/defstra/enviro-eng.asp">http://forces.gc.ca/site/pri/first-premier/defstra/enviro-eng.asp</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span>.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The commitment to collective defense remains a core purpose of the Alliance. Article 5 of the NATO Treaty specifically states: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The Treaty goes on to state that NATO states will use the full force necessary to defend against such an attack.&nbsp; This commitment was recently reaffirmed in NATO’s new strategic concept: “NATO members will always assist each other against attack, in accordance with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. That commitment remains firm and binding.”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Furthermore, NATO has already backed up its words with actions: when Article 5 was invoked on September 12, 2001, following the attacks on New York and Washington, NATO agreed on, and delivered, a package of measures to support the United States.</p><p>And the United States, which has the largest armed forces among the Allies is also firm in its commitment to defending other NATO Allies. For example, Rose Gottemoeller, U.S. assistant secretary of state for verification, stated on a visit to Lithuania: “The point that I can most clearly repeat and underscore today for you is that NATO will protect NATO... I know that is a view that is shared by all NATO allies that NATO will protect NATO”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>So, it seems clear that NATO would defend its European member states if they were attacked, allowing them an opportunity to reduce their armed forces.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> “The North Atlantic Treaty”. <u>North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</u> April 4<sup>th</sup>, 1949. <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm">http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> “Strategic Concept For the Defence and Security of The Members of the North Atlantic Treaty&nbsp;Organisation.” <u>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</u>, November 2010, <a href="http://www.nato.int/lisbon2010/strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf">http://www.nato.int/lisbon2010/strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span>.</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> “NATO will protect its members with missile defence system”. <u>The Lithuania Tribune</u>.

                    <p>European member states cannot assume that NATO will come to their defense if attacked. Article 5 of the NATO Treaty states that the member states “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> – it is not an automatic commitment to military defense.&nbsp; According to Michael A. Goldberg, Editor in Chief of the Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review, “after NATO invokes Article Five, each Ally must then consider what assistance it should and will provide;” and, “Allies can provide any form of assistance they deem necessary to respond to the situation”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.&nbsp; Relying on NATO is unwise. This is especially true because of NATO’s decision-making structure requires full consensus, which Jay Bergman, professor of Russian history at Central Connecticut State University, describes thus: “if just one member objects, a course of action the remaining 27 members favor cannot be carried out.”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Therefore NATO’s European members must still be able to defend themselves, because one dissenting country could unravel their full protection.</p><p>Furthermore, NATO is a <em>collective</em> defense organization.&nbsp; The European member states – 25 of the 28 Allies - cannot unilaterally reduce their own armed forces and still expect the United States and Canada to come to their aid.&nbsp; Commentators in North America are already concerned that the European member states are not pulling their weight.&nbsp; As outgoing US Defense Secretary Robert Gates noted in his final speech at NATO: “The blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress – and in the American body politic writ large – to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense.”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> The European member states thus need to continue to invest in defense if they are to continue to benefit from membership of NATO.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>“The North Atlantic Treaty”. <u>North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</u> April 4<sup>th</sup>, 1949. <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm">http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Michael Goldberg.&nbsp; “MIRAGE OF DEFENSE: REEXAMINING ARTICLE FIVE OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY AFTER THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES”. <a href="http://www.bc.edu/dam/files/schools/law/lawreviews/journals/bciclr/26_1/03_TXT.htm">http://www.bc.edu/dam/files/schools/law/lawreviews/journals/bciclr/26_1/03_TXT.htm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Jay Bergman. “NATO Past and Present, and Why the Obama Administration Values it”.

                    <p>The problem with nuclear deterrence is that nuclear weapons cause many small wars, a phenomenon known as the <em>stability-instability paradox</em>. Peter Lavoy explains: “mutual fear of big weapons may produce, instead of peace, a spate of smaller wars… states armed with nuclear weapons might bully or attack their non-nuclear neighbors and then use their nuclear arsenals to intimidate foreign powers from intervening.”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Indeed this has played out in the history of the nuclear age. Nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction provided the backdrop for Cold War confrontations between the superpowers that occurred through their proxies in theatres like Vietnam and Afghanistan.<a href="/print/17651#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp; So even when they have nuclear weapons nations need to keep their troops for conventional wars.</p><p>Moreover, third party groups (mainly terrorists) can avoid this deterrence by remaining stateless. Deterrence relies on the enemy having cities and a population that can be threatened with obliteration. Terrorist organisations have neither. They are simply groups of individuals with no responsibility for, and no control over, a state or its population. As a consequence there is no deterrence as there is nowhere to retaliate against.<sup> <a href="/print/17651#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a></sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, Sofaer argues that “States can attempt to avoid responsibility for attacks by using terrorists to carry them out. States can also enable terrorists to attack other states by refusing to prevent such attacks, as the Taliban did. In either situation, establishing responsibility for attacks is a formidable problem, greatly complicating national deterrence.”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> So, armed forces are necessary to combat these threats.</p><p>Finally, nuclear deterrence doesn’t take into account irrational actors, as Dershowitz shows: “[Nuclear deterrence] theory depends largely upon actors making calculations and counter-calculations based on each other’s contemplated actions and reactions. Near the other end of the continuum are largely futile attempts to deter impulsive actions by irrational actors. These actions may be caused by such factors as passion, [or] impulse.”<a href="/print/17651#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a> Given that actors such as North Korea may be considered somewhat irrational, nuclear deterrence is not sufficient justification to reduce armed forces.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Peter Lavoy, The Strategic Consequences of Nuclear Proliferation, Security Studies, Vol.4, No.4, 1995, Chairman of the National Intelligence Council.</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> P.R.

                    <p>The liberal view of international relations argues that the anarchic nature of the international system has been exaggerated and, to the extent that it exists, alliances and other forms of cooperation can mitigate its effects. NATO is such an alliance. As a collective security organization, its members have committed themselves to cooperate to the benefit of their mutual security and to assist each other in the event of an attack.&nbsp; They do not need large militaries, as together, the Allies already have large enough armed forces for defensive purposes.&nbsp; And, as NATO itself recognizes, the threat of a direct military attack on the European member states is very remote.</p>        </div>

It is not legitimate to maintain armed forces for these purposes.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17651#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Wheatcroft, Geoffrey, “Who Needs NATO?” <em>The New York Times</em>, June, 15 2011, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/opinion/16iht-edwheatcroft16.html?ref=global">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/opinion/16iht-edwheatcroft16.html?ref=global</a> <span class="print-footnote">[17]</span>.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The military is one of the largest employers for any state. And many other employers supply and otherwise support the armed forces. Reducing them would increase unemployment and burden the state.&nbsp; Most NATO members cannot find enough jobs for everyone right now, never mind reducing the Armed forces and making thousands more men and women unemployed.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Giving jobs to people when we don’t need them is only a short-term fix, which will cause an increase in either taxes or the budget deficit, or more likely a combination of the two. Keeping these jobs means increasing the debt of each nation, and so it fails as a long-term solution.&nbsp; We would be better to invest in sustainable jobs that increase, rather than drain, the national wealth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
