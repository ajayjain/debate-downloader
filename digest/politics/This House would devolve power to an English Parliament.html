    <h1 class="print-title">This House would devolve power to an English Parliament</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>This debate arises as a consequence of devolution, a policy carried out by the UK&rsquo;s Labour government from 1997. Devolution is the process of giving certain previously centralised powers to regional governments. Under the 1997 policy, the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly were created and contained similarities to the Stormont Parliament in Northern Ireland, which was established in the 1920s but then abolished in the 1970s. These legislative bodies are separately elected by UK citizens resident in Scotland and Wales and make policy on areas such as education, health, agriculture and justice. Policy in these areas in England is made by the UK Parliament (at Westminster in London), which also legislates on UK-wide policy, such as defence, economy and foreign policy. Scottish and Welsh citizens, therefore, vote in two elections &ndash; one to choose their representatives in the Scottish Parliament (Members of the Scottish Parliament &ndash; MSPs), or Welsh Assembly (Assembly Members &ndash; AMs) and another to choose their representatives in the Westminster Parliament (Members of Parliament &ndash; MPs). In contrast, English citizens only vote to elect MPs. A problem, known as the &lsquo;West Lothian Question&rsquo;, that arises from this is that Scottish and Welsh MPs get to vote on policy that only affects England, since the relevant policy in Scotland or Wales is decided on by the devolved bodies. One proposed solution is that England should also have its own legislative body &ndash; the English Parliament &ndash; which would decide on the same issues for England as the Scottish Parliament does for Scotland, leaving Westminster to decide only on those issues of UK-wide significance. Essentially, this debate will cover issues on the representation of English issues, the &lsquo;West Lothian Question&rsquo; and population.</p>

                    <p>The status quo denies the English their own distinctive political identity. The devolution settlement acknowledges that the political preferences and cultural identities of the Scottish, Welsh and English peoples are sufficiently different to warrant the creation of separate Scottish and Welsh legislatures. If political preferences were the same between these nations, there would be no problem with having one central Parliament. Proponents of devolution must, therefore, believe that such differences exist. However, having done the Scottish and Welsh the service of allowing them to elect representatives of their political preferences, the UK denies this right to the English, forcing them to continue to be subject to the political preferences of the Scottish and Welsh, who can vote in Westminster elections. This process is clearly unfair, and generates an inequality within the UK. This is exemplified by the fact that in the 2005 General Elections, a plurality of English votes were cast in favour of the Conservative Party,(35.7% compared to labour's 35.4%)<sup>1</sup> but a Labour Government was elected, partly on the back of the heavily Labour-dominated Scottish and Welsh votes.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/vote2005/html/england.stmm">Election 2005, 'Results England' BBC News, 10 May 2005</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span>, accessed 28 August 2011</p>        </div>

                    <p style="margin-left:1.7pt;">The devolution settlement was designed with English dominance in mind. The reason why the Scottish and Welsh desired autonomy from Westminster was against a historical backdrop of oppression by the English, and because of a remaining fact that the English dominated proceedings at Westminster. This is for three reasons: 1) the location of the UK Parliament in London, which meant that all MPs were residents of England; 2) the population of England compared to Scotland and Wales, guaranteeing it a substantial majority of seats; and 3) the economic power of England within the UK, particularly that of London. The necessitated independent representative bodies for Scotland and Wales, whose political identities were suppressed before devolution. Post-devolution, no such problem exists for England– it remains the dominant nation within the UK Parliament, and has little difficulty exerting its influence over UK politics (indeed it continues to exert more influence over Scotland through Sewell motions than the Scottish Parliament does). The statistic about the 2005 General Election is a diversion, since Labour would still have won a majority of seats in England, despite not having a plurality of votes (owing to the first-past-the-post electoral system). In addition to this, it is clear that the English themselves are relatively uninterested in devolution and the issues brought about by the ‘West Lothian Question’.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In the early 21<sup>st</sup> century the main preference of English constituencies was for the status quo of government by the UK Parliament in Westminster.<sup>2</sup></p><p style="margin-left:1.7pt;">&nbsp;</p><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Has+devolution+made+a+difference&amp;btnG=Search+Books,">Alan Trench, ‘Introduction - Has Devolution Made a Difference?’ pp. 1-10, in <em>Has Devolution Made a Difference?: The State of Nations 2004,</em> ed.

                    <p>There is an issue with accountability under the status quo. Around 20% of the MPs elected to Parliament are elected from constituencies outside of England, and these MPs all get to vote on issues which affect only England. Most MPs can be held to account for their decisions by their local constituents, who can lobby their MPs by writing to them, attending local surgeries (meetings with the MPs) or by switching their vote at the next election. Such scrutiny and accountability takes place under the assumption that when the MP votes, she does so in the interests of her constituents, and they may protest if she does not vote in their interests. However, for the 20% of Parliament whose constituents are totally unaffected by the outcome of the vote, no accountability can be expected. No Scottish or Welsh constituents will write to their local MP, or change the way they vote, based on their MP's voting record on matters which cannot affect them. As such, a fifth of MPs stay in their jobs without fear of public scrutiny, and knowing that the likelihood of their being re-elected is divorced from their voting record in Parliament. An English Parliament would solve this problem, by creating a situation in which all politicians vote only on those issues that may affect their constituents. Politicians, such as Malcolm Rifkind, have suggested that an English Parliament, or in this case Grand Committee, would increase the accountability of MPs thus making the system much fairer<sup>1</sup>.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2799542.ece">Rifkind, Malcolm, 'Be fair, give devolution to England', The Times, Nov. 4th 2007</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span>, accessed 27th June 2011</p>        </div>

                    <p>To say that the 'West Lothian Question' hinders accountability is to misunderstand how the electorate votes. General elections are not, as the proposition case requires, decided upon by the local electorate's satisfaction with their MP. They are, effectively, voted in along party lines, with the electorate voting for the party they prefer, not the candidate. As a result, it is nonsense to believe that politicians are held to account by local lobbying efforts, letters to MPs and constituency surgeries. They are held to account by media scrutiny, by the effect of the central government's policies on people's lives, and by Parliamentary committees and the opposition.<br>The introduction of an English Parliament would, in fact, reduce the quality of policy-making and accountability by spreading a scarce number of talented policy-makers and politicians over a greater number of legislative bodies and parliamentary committees. It is good that the Westminster Parliament concentrates the most successful political operators in one organisation, which can develop good policy and effectively hold the government to account. Good policies made for England by Westminster can then be recommended to the Scottish Parliament, a procedure known as a Sewell motion.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Devolution in England represents the eventual division of the UK. As previously mentioned, certain inequalities of population and representation would cause national instability and would lead to competition and division. Many British nationalists, including the UKIP (United Kingdom Independence Party), think that devolution is detrimental to the maintenance of the UK and so they are against English devolution. The party suggests that all forms of devolution, including Welsh, Scottish and Irish, should be abolished in order to maintain the Union and cause greater maintenance of centralised power. Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer believes that an English institutional Parliament would lead to the eventual disintegration of the UK as a union<sup>1</sup>. In short, English devolution has been considered as damaging the British identity as a unionised nation. Devolution would facilitate a change in national identities because of the division of the union, which many in the UK would not find easy to accept.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4792120.stm">BBC News, 'No English Parliament - Falconer'</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span>,&nbsp;Friday, 10 March 2006</p>        </div>

                    <p>Devolution for England should take priority over the maintenance of the Union because it is basically a more democratic system. A political correspondent from BBC New commented that 'There may not be massive demand for an entirely separate and new English Parliament, but there is growing resentment at England-only issues being decided by politicians from other parts of the United Kingdom.'<sup>1</sup> So to a certain extent, devolution is considered essential to political equality and, therefore, would mean a more democratic Union.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4792120.stm">BBC News, 'No English Parliament - Falconer'</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span>, 10th March 2006</p>        </div>

                    <p>The Scottish and Welsh assemblies were created to give those nations ' national focus'. Some believe that English devolution would leave England without such a national focus. Labour's plan for England did not provide England with regional governments comparable with the Scottish and Welsh assemblies. The regions themselves, with the exception of Yorkshire, have relatively no historic or cultural identity. The only part of England that might conceivably need its own devolved assembly is Cornwall but Labour's proposals mean that Cornwall is governed from Bristol rather than Truro. England is not a 'huge area'. It is a small country in terms of size. While the English form 80% plus of the UK population there is just as much diversity in Scotland (where two native languages are spoken) and in Wales<sup>1</sup>. The Outer Hebrides have little in common with the cities of the Lothian's - except that they are Scottish. Regionalisation is a top-down policy imposed by the British Government. Regions may be the Napoleonic solution to the governance of England but they are not the democratic one. The nations of the Great Britain Parliament are at present divided into manageable areas of authority, however, devolution in England would cause problems. Areas like Newcastle in the North contrast very differently with in the South like Kent. Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland are smaller units with their own parliament but England would not be sensible if it was divided into one separate parliament. To suddenly create an English Parliament would be a slapdash response to a more serious political problem aimed only at appeasing a minority of nationalists.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=15106">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=15106,&nbsp;</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span>accessed 27th June 2011</p>        </div>

                    <p>Devolution in England would not have to mean lots of regional parliaments; it could instead mean one parliament for the whole of England. Either form would be fairer. It is argued that, not only is regional government practical in decision-making and focusing on the needs of the localities, but also it is more democratic<sup>1</sup>. In theory, it would give greater communication between the public and central authority with regional governments acting as mediators. Some have argued that instead of singular parliament for England, it should be divided into areas and built up like a regional government. This was the original plan as part of Labour's devolution process. This would help to deal with the divisions within England itself while also helping to appease areas of England, such as Cornwall, who are already positive about being separated from England.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/arguments_for_devolution.htm">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/arguments_for_devolution.htm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span>, accessed 27th June 2011</p>        </div>

                    <p>English devolution would mean instability within the Union because of population imbalances and increased competitions and tension. Some fear that such instabilities could have a drastic and detrimental effect on the maintenance of the Union. The Bow Group paper went further, taking devolution to its logical conclusion. If devolution is implemented, this would cause more problems (and conflict) than it would solve<sup>1</sup>. It would create what Will Hutton called 'a witches' brew of internecine rivalry ' (just as in the seven kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England)<sup>2</sup>. There are problems even today over transfers of payments when Welsh people receive treatment in England. England has a population of 52 million out of 62 million in the UK as a whole. This would create a situation where the English parliament would end up completely dominating and becoming more important, in the English perspective, than the UK Parliament. This would provide cause to suggest that the instabilities that show themselves within the Union after total devolution would lead to more drastic collapse which will be explored next.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.bowgroup.org/content/devolution-all-round-manifesto-2005">Whelan, Dennis, 'Devolution All Round: A Manifesto for 2005,' The Bow Group</a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span>, accessed 2nd July 2011<br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://thecep.org.uk/in-depth/the-constitutional-case/the-solutions/"> http://thecep.org.uk/in-depth/the-constitutional-case/the-solutions</a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span>, accessed 27th June 2011</p>        </div>

                    <p>England already dominates the Union. Creating a federal UK between nations would not therefore increase English domination and might conceivably lessen it, as devolution has begun to show. The English Parliament would only become 'more important' to the English on matters of English domestic policy, just as the Scottish Parliament is now more important than Westminster for the Scottish people on these matters. England is no more or less 'homogenous' than Scotland or Wales and indeed regional differences in England are less significant than those in Scotland even the Labour party never contemplated a degree of regional devolution for England equivalent to devolution in Scotland or Wales<sup>1</sup>. The evidence so far is that there would be no diminution in the North-South divide, no significant economic gains for poorer regions and no serious decentralisation of government. A better solution is a move to a full federal Union where the population of each federal region is as pragmatically equal as possible (as was Labour's original plan for devolution). England is not one homogeneous region, and has a clear north-south divide. Federal regions would allow less well off regions to introduce policies that would be more befitting to the more local needs e.g. the North East could reduce corporation taxes to attract more investment to that region. This would help to reduce the north-south divide by reducing the excessive concentration of political and economic power that currently exists in the South East. Therefore, because these regions will become more stable and independent within themselves, there should be no worries concerning hostility and division.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/arguments_for_devolution.htm">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/arguments_for_devolution.htm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span>, accessed 27th June 2011</p>        </div>

                    <p>An English Parliament is required to overcome a democratic deficit. In the status quo, Scottish and Welsh MPs get to vote on issues that do not affect their constituents, but may be pivotal in getting through legislation that affects the English. This in fact happened with the vote on university top-up fees: top-up fees were implemented in England despite a majority of English MPs voting against introducing them. They were passed only because Scottish MPs voted with the government, even though the Scottish Parliament had already voted not to introduce them for Scottish universities. Here we have a clear example of the representatives of English citizens voting down a proposal, but the policy being implemented on the English (against their will) because of the votes of outsiders. This totally undermines the democratic principle of self-rule and according to Paul Kingsworth these policies are, therefore, flawed. The policies were not, in many cases, representative of the public's wishes in the geographical area they were to be implemented<sup>1</sup>. Democracy exists so that a population can decide for itself what laws it lives under– the absence of an English Parliament denies the English this right to decide for themselves, because sometimes the Scots and Welsh decide for them.<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1 </sup><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/feb/18/devolution-england-pseudo-democracy">Paul Kingsworth, ‘England is a pseudo-democracy’, <em>guardian.co.uk</em>, 18<sup>th</sup> February 2010, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span>accessed 28<sup>th</sup> August 2011</p><p><sup>2 </sup><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-big-question-what-is-the-west-lothian-question-and-can-it-be-resolved-satisfactorily-406571.html">Andy McSmith, ‘The Big Question: What is the West Lothian question, and can it be resolved satisfactorily?’, <em>The Independent</em>, 4<sup>th</sup> July 2006,</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span> accessed 27<sup>th</sup> June 2011.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The 'West Lothian Question' creates no more problems than any other aspect of a system of representative democracy. It is simply a feature of democracy that large institutions make decisions which don't affect all of the population, and yet we have no problem with everyone getting a say in those matters. Parliament makes policy on education and health, for example, despite some people not being affected by those decisions. The fact that the Scottish and Welsh voters have an influence over English affairs is no more undemocratic than some English people getting to have a say on matters that will affect other English people. In order to make the claim that the English are denied a right to self-rule because of the 'West Lothian Question', one would have to claim that there was some special quality&nbsp;– ‘Englishness’ – that made English people qualified to make decisions on behalf of one another, but disqualified the Scots from making such decisions. Such a quality clearly does not exist – a representative of Berwick-upon-Tweed is no more able to look after the interests of someone from Cornwall than a representative of Dumfries. Some also believe that that an English Parliament would cause further friction between conflicting wishes and policies and would, eventually, cause Britain to act undemocratically.<sup>1</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><br clear="all"><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://commonrepresentation.org.uk">http://commonrepresentation.org.uk</a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span>, accessed 27<sup>th</sup> June 2011</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is problematic that England, Scotland and Wales elect politicians to the same legislature with differing mandates. A mandate is a commission given to a government and its policies or an elected representative and his policies through an electoral victory. The Westminster Parliament can only affect the Scottish and Welsh through foreign policy, therefore, Scottish and Welsh MPs are elected by their constituents with a mandate to enact policy in areas of foreign policy. Meanwhile, English politicians have a mandate to enact both foreign and domestic policy, since their electorates vote them in to carry out these functions. This means that one set of MPs are not acting under an electoral mandate when they vote in Parliament and, consequently, their decisions lack the legitimacy of English MPs. Separating the functions of foreign and domestic policy into two separate parliaments would make the mandates of elected politicians clear, and enable all MPs to vote with a consistent level of legitimacy<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.devolution.ac.uk/Final%20Conf/Devolution%20in%20England.pdf"> <a href="http://www.devolution.ac.uk/Final%20Conf/Devolution%20in%20England.pdf" title="http://www.devolution.ac.uk/Final%20Conf/Devolution%20in%20England.pdf">http://www.devolution.ac.uk/Final%20Conf/Devolution%20in%20England.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span>, accessed 27th June 2011</a></p>        </div>

                    <p style="margin-left:1.7pt;">Again, the proposition's case rests on anunrealistic view of what constitutes a political mandate. The electorate do not elect politicians with a specific set of policies in mind, but rather treat the General Election as a referendum on the government. Since the central government still controls aspects of Scottish and Welsh life (through macroeconomic and foreign policy decisions and Sewell motions), it is appropriate that Scottish and Welsh voters should have a say in who sits in that government. It is not the case that an English Parliament would not affect the Scottish and Welsh at all – economic movement and the free movement of people within the UK, overlapping public bodies and administration, and the political and economic impact of England on the rest of the UK would all contribute to the effect of the English Parliament on Scotland and Wales.<sup>1</sup> Thus, an effective referendum on the government of England is one in which Scotland and Wales should have a say.</p><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/arguments_for_devolution.htm">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/arguments_for_devolution.htm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span>, accessed on 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011</p>        </div>

                    <p>A devolved parliament for England would mean an unnecessary drain on the resources of the taxpayer and of the UK as a whole. Further representation for the English, in some views, would mean higher taxes and higher amounts of politicians. At present, politicians do not have the best reputation concerning authority and financial resourcefulness, so it is no wonder that a contingent of public opinion would be against devolution. David Cameron has said that the answer was 'not a separate English Parliament with more politicians spending taxpayers' money'<sup>1</sup>. To some, devolution in England would mean an awkward time of readjustment and the drain on resources is considered to be unnecessary because some are content with the way things are run centrally now. The sheer cost of establishing something that is already done in London would be too much for what you got at the end<sup>2</sup>. Further, there have been comments on how an English devolved Parliament would drain the resources, particularly of south East England by having its headquarters in London which is already the location of centralised government and the London Assembly.<br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3639162/Cameron-cant-ignore-devolution-for-England.html">Dale</a> <span class="print-footnote">[13]</span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3639162/Cameron-cant-ignore-devolution-for-England.html">, Iain, 'Cameron can't ignore devolution for England', The Telegraph, 13th April 2007</a> <span class="print-footnote">[13]</span>, accessed on 1st July 2011<br><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/arguments_for_devolution.html">http</a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span><a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/arguments_for_devolution.html">://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/arguments_for_devolution.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span>,accessed 27th June 2011</p>        </div>

                    <p>An English Parliament would not mean 'more politicians' because the British Parliament could be reduced in size. One of the simplest and least expensive ways of creating an English Parliament would be to designate the House of Commons as the English Parliament (minus MPs from non-English constituencies) and the House of Lords (reformed and entirely elected) as the British Parliament. Very little cost, no new buildings, fewer politicians - and one tier less of government as English legislation would not have to be referred to a second chamber. Some politicians, like the previously mentioned Malcolm Rifkind, suggest a type of committee that would work alongside the House of Commons and would cost relatively little<sup>1</sup>. Moving on from this, an English Parliament does not have to be in London. Either the English or British Parliaments (at a certain cost) could be sited somewhere north of Watford, thus helping to reduce the North-South divide. The English Parliament would have powers comparable to those of the Scottish Parliament and would represent England's national interests.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2799542.ece">Rifkind, Malcolm, 'Be fair, give devolution to England', The Times, Nov. 4th 2007, , accessed 27th June 2011</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p>        </div>
