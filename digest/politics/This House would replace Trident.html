    <div class="print-content"><p>In 1952 the United Kingdom became the third country to test and independently developed nuclear weapon. The country continues to have nuclear weapons in its arsenal and is one of the five nuclear weapons states set out in the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty of 1968. However despite having independently developed nuclear weapons the United Kingdom now cooperates with the United States in developing its nuclear weapons. Britain&rsquo;s current nuclear deterrent is maintained by four Vanguard submarines with the first having been commissioned in 1993. These submarines each carry sixteen trident missiles which were designed by the United States and are provided to the UK by a modification of the previous the Polaris Sales Agreement.<a href="/print/25002#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The submarines are expected to remain in service until the 2020s. In 2006 the white paper &lsquo;The Future of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Nuclear Deterrent&rsquo; argued that Britain needs to retain a nuclear deterrent but did not take the final decision on the replacement of trident or if it is retained how much of a deterrent is needed.<a href="/print/25002#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> But because of the long lead time necessary for designing and building replacements work has already started on some of the components which would be necessary for new submarines such as the reactor cores. Despite this the government maintains the final decision on trident has not yet been made and is expected in 2016.<a href="/print/25002#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>

                    <p>The Trident Weapons System while it may be a &quot;horrific part of our system&quot; is still necessary even in today&rsquo;s post-Cold War world. Firstly through deterrence it protects us from being blackmailed by any other states, and in particular so called &quot;rogue states&quot; like North Korea and potentially in the future Iran who could threaten our vital interests &ndash; such as closing the straits of Hormuz.<a href="/print/25002#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Moreover having a second strike capability, the ability for nuclear weapons to survive a nuclear assault by an opponent so allowing retaliation, is also still necessary.<a href="/print/25002#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> It may currently seem unlikely that any of the major nuclear armed states will threaten the United Kingdom however we do not know what may happen in the future and by the time a threat appears it would be too late to build a new nuclear second strike capability.</p>

                    <p>A deterrent is useless if no one thinks it will ever be used. The only conceivable use of Britain&rsquo;s nuclear deterrent would be in the event of a nuclear attack on the UK, and if that has happened then there is little point in firing the missiles as there will be nothing left to save. Any blackmail today is likely to be much smaller, no state is going to threaten the use of nuclear weapons in order to get their way on trade. The only real possibility of nuclear blackmail is by terrorists who could not be deterred by a nuclear armament.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Currently the UK is recognised as a nuclear power by the Nuclear non-proliferation treaty along with the USA, China, France and Russia. All of whom are either modernising or maintaining their current nuclear arsenals. This means to not replace Trident would mean that we&#39;d suffer a severe loss of status in relation to the other permanent members of the UN Security Council. This would also raise questions of whether the UK even deserves its place as a member there as it would show the UK&rsquo;s declining global role and military power. Other countries that can be considered &quot;more representative&quot; such as India (the world&#39;s largest democracy) now would be an obvious replacement at the top table.<a href="/print/25002#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Churchill said that the H bomb that it was &quot;our badge to the Royal Enclosure [at Ascot]&quot;<a href="/print/25002#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> and today Trident remains one of our master keys to the Britain&rsquo;s status at organisations such as the United Nations Security Council. There are already plenty of reasons why other countries might be more deserving of a security council place than the UK; we don&rsquo;t need to add another.</p>

                    <p>Status in the world is not based upon having one extremely powerful weapon; there are much more important factors such as a country&rsquo;s economy and use of diplomacy. Britain would still be a major financial centre, a major economy, a member of the UNSC (which is not based on nuclear weapons) as well as being one of the biggest contributors to peace and security in the world through peacekeeping and aid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Status&rsquo; is one of the popular justifications for acquiring nuclear weapons. However while countries like North Korea that develop nuclear weapons may acquire deterrence they don&rsquo;t gain any more diplomatic clout. Britain giving up its deterrent or combining it into a European deterrent would help to undermine this perception by showing that nuclear weapons are not needed to maintain a powerful role in the world.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The UK nuclear weapons programme was first created in late 1945 a time when people were concerned about the US commitment to Europe which was uncertain as the rise of the Iron Curtain had not been yet apparent. Currently if we didn&#39;t replace trident and disarmed more likely than not we would fall under the American strategic nuclear umbrella which would be fair enough in the short term and medium term as the relationship is currently strong despite certain cobblestones. A similar thing also applies with the French</p>
<p>But can we really rely on the Americans to keep that umbrella extended over the long term when their interests and emphasis may shift, regardless of cultural or ideological links? Relying on someone else&rsquo;s deterrent will always be risky as the US or France would not want to put themselves at risk of being attacked in order to deter an attack on us.<a href="/print/25002#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> An independent deterrence arsenal is necessary to maintain deterrence.</p>

The USA can at the moment easily pull the rug out from underneath us. While the UK maintains command and control over its weapons the United States is needed to keep the weapons operational.

                    <p>A state of the art nuclear weapons system is always going to be costly and no one wants to cut corners for the risks that could create.

                    <p>One country disarming is not going to persuade others, particularly those like China and Russia that still consider themselves great powers, to do so. At the same time the United Kingdom&rsquo;s situation can never be compared to other countries; Israel would argue it is surrounded by enemies, China that it needs them if the US has them etc. These countries would only consider whether to disarm based upon their own national interests not what other states have done. We should do the same and renew trident as being necessary for the defence of the realm.</p>

                    <p>When the United Kingdom first tested Nuclear Weapons in 1952 she was still a great power with a large empire to defend. In the early 1980s when trident was being conceived<a href="/print/25002#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> the UK fought a war with Argentina and the Cold War was perhaps at its deepest following the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. The Country was therefore in an international situation in which nuclear weapons were potentially required to deter the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>A study of the vulnerability of Nuclear Weapons states shows that the UK is the least vulnerable nuclear weapons state because the country is surrounded by allies and is nowhere near any states that may potentially become failed states.<a href="/print/25002#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The only conclusion from this can be that the UK no longer has any need for nuclear weapons.</p>

                    <p>That Britain is not currently threatened with nuclear Armageddon as it was during the cold war does not mean that such a threat could never again occur. Britain must remain prepared for any eventuality which has to include the unthinkable such as the United States no longer being an ally.</p>
<p>The world is not yet a safe place there are many unstable states, such as North Korea,&nbsp;developing nuclear weapons capabalities. Beyond these dangers it is easily conceivable that the world will once again face tensions similar to those of the cold war. Given the length of time it would take to rearm should such tensions occur Britain would be safer to keep its nuclear armament.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Sharing procurement of nuclear weapons delivery systems makes simple sense through sharing the cost. The UK only contributed 5% of the original cost of trident but the UK systems are just as potent. This however does not mean that the UK weapons systems are not independent.
