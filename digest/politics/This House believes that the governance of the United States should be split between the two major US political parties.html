    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes that the governance of the United States should be split between the two major US political parties</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>In the United States, divided government describes a situation in which one party controls the White House and another party controls one or both houses of the United States Congress. Divided government is suggested by some to be an undesirable product of the separation of powers in the United States' political system, resulting in political gridlock and little progress. By others, it is considered a desirable outcome that helps maintain checks on the excesses of opposing political parties. In the 2008 US presidential election, the topic received attention because the prospect of one-party rule loomed and subsequently became a reality with the election of Democrat Barack Obama and further additions to the Democratic majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives in the United States Congress. John McCain argued, in the last days of his presidential campaign, that electing Barack Obama would be a bad idea because it would lead to one-party rule and that this would be harmful. &nbsp;With the Republicans having regained control of the Senate in 2010 the question has arisen again in respect of the 2012 presidential election. The debate regarding divided government vs. one-party rule is framed by some of the following questions. Does divided government create a necessary check on government and the excesses of one political party or another? Can presidents of one political party more effectively constrain the actions of their own party? Does the Supreme Court provide a sufficient check on one-party rule? Is divided government more stable? Can one-party rule be important in passing legislation quickly and solving crises? Does divided government lift up more centrist, and perhaps more long-lasting ideas and reforms? Does divided government constrain corruption? What does history demonstrate? Have divided or one-party governments been more successful? What do voters prefer?</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>Proposition makes the assumption that Single-Party Government prevents Checks and Balances to be enacted within the United States Government.

                    <p>The Constitution of the United States is designed to prevent power from being concentrated in one place, with each of the three branches (executive, legislative and judicial) placing checks and balances upon each other. As James Madison wrote “It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part.”<a href="/print/17954#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>This principle ensures that power is divided, facilitating greater dialogue between the branches and between the two houses of Congress which seeks to compromise with each other to provide the best possible expression of Congress’ will.</p><p>Such a need for compromise between the branches lends itself to having control of the two elected branches being spilt between two parties necessitating compromise as opposed to single party control of both houses, where compromise can be pre-arranged to fit the aims of the executive. Therefore, Divided Government is an extra requirement to government, ensuring that powers are not concentrated to the detriment of Americans.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17954#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Madison, James, ‘The Federalist No.51 The Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks and Balances Between the Different Departments’, <em>Independent Journal</em>, 6 February 1788, <a href="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm" title="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm">http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is true that the Founding Fathers did design the complexion of the Federal Government in such a way that prevents power from being concentrated in one place. This made sense in the eighteenth century when the states had most of the power. However the power and responsibilities of the federal government has expanded dramatically. The United States is no longer best off with a slow government that creates compromise. In a period where the poles of the parties are increasingly powerful government is not just slow but glacial as is shown by the crisis in 2011 over negotiations to raise the debt ceiling.<a href="/print/17954#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Single party government would be able to get its legislation passed and could actually govern rather than merely engaging in political manoeuvring to fend off the other party.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17954#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> MacAskill, Ewen, and Rushe, Dominic, ‘US debt crisis talks reach an impasse’, <em>guardian.co.uk</em>, 26 July 2011, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jul/26/us-debt-crisis-talks-impasse" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jul/26/us-debt-crisis-talks-impasse">http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jul/26/us-debt-crisis-talks-impasse</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Congress is a bicameral body, with its constituent parts, the House of Representatives and Senate, working largely independent of each other to create bills. However necessary for both the house and Senate to pass laws in identical form in order for it to become law.<a href="/print/17954#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> A period of ‘Reconciliation’ is usually required to find a compromise between two different versions of the same bill in order to maintain and improve what is best about proposed reforms and eliminate flaws before it becomes law.<a href="/print/17954#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>This independence between the two chambers, with Reconciliation being one of the few areas where the two meet can allow for division in Congress between the two major parties. Indeed this can be seen as beneficial, as the broadest ideological range will be considered when making a policy work by reconciling two bills, making sure that centrist policy is enacted, preventing an ideological swing against the wishes of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17954#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Goldman et al., <em>The Challenge of Democracy</em>, Brief ed., Fourth ed., New York 2001, p.196</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17954#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> United States Senate, ‘reconciliation process’, <a href="http://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/reconciliation_process.htm" title="http://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/reconciliation_process.htm">http://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/reconciliation_process.htm</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Congress maybe a bicameral body, but it still needs to be able to work effectively and having control split between the parties is not conducive to this. Reconciliation only truly works when there is a clear and coherent ideological programme to work around when making straightening differences between laws. In an ever more polarised politics, divided government would be more likely to result in gridlock as is the case in 2011 the reconciliation.</p><p>Voters may also choose an ideological swing, rendering such a point moot. There was a clear mandate for Republican policies from 2003 to 2007 and Democratic policies from 2009. Every democracy has its losers. Voters recognise this and vote for a clear program at elections, not a watered down version of it.</p>        </div>
