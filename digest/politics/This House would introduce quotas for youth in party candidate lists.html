    <hr class="print-hr" />
    <h1 class="print-title">This House would introduce quotas for youth in party candidate lists</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>There are two standard ways of approaching quotas in the selection of candidates for public office in a first past the post. One is to insist that all shortlists must contain at least one &ndash; and sometimes more &ndash; candidate meeting that description. This is, with some justification, treated as tokenism as the real issue is who is finally selected rather than who made the list and attempts of this kind have tended to create also-rans. In this particular regard there is a real concern as the major benefit of this approach is that it provides experience of the selection process for that person to try their luck elsewhere at a later date. This can be a useful exercise with some groups but would be self-defeating with young people. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to assume that before standing for parliament a typical candidate would be likely to graduate and then at least make a start on another career. Realistically this would put them in their mid- to late-twenties. Treating this as a trial run would simply see them better placed to squeeze out younger candidates a few years later when they were in their thirties at the time of the next election. This approach &ndash; at least one woman on the shortlist &ndash; was tried by Labour in 1992 and achieved a negligible effect. It is impossible to demonstrate a situation in which the resulting member of parliament would not have been elected anyway.</p>
<p>Realistically if candidates were much younger, say 18 to twenty-five, their age would become a significant electoral issue with voters. The law determining the minimum age to be a candidate was changed in 2006, reducing it from 21 to 18. In those British legislatures that allow election by party list, this system allows for a more creative use of this approach as parties can impose quotas of this kind full in the knowledge that more than one is likely to be elected &ndash; at least in some cases.</p>
<p>Recent examples of those elected or selected without a quota in place, have been the Labour MP for Airdrie and Shotts elected at the age of 28 and, in the previous election, the Liberal Democrat MP for East Dunbartonshire, Jo Swinson, who was elected at the age of 27, making her the first MP to be born in the 1980s. It seems to be something of a trait for the Liberal Democrats &ndash; or their predecessor parties &ndash; both David Steel and Charles Kennedy were elected in their twenties &ndash; the latter at 23.</p>
<p>A more realistic definition of this motion would relate to the imposition of shortlists along the lines of the Labour Party&rsquo;s introduction of All Women Shortlists (AWS). In this scenario, the party identifies one half of all winnable seats and compels local parties to select only women. There are major ethical and political issues with this approach but, in this instance, the major hurdle was a legal one. In 1996, an industrial tribunal ruled that all women shortlists were illegal under the 1975 sexual Discrimination at Work Act and the practice was suspended. However, the 34 candidates who had already been selected by that point were allowed to proceed and many went on to form a part of the female contingent of new Labour MPs in 1997 nicknamed Blair&rsquo;s Babes.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this debate, we will assume that any legal obstacles have been removed and consider the political and ethical consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Debaters&rsquo; Note</strong></p>
<p>It is important for Proposition to deal with the legal issue from the outset. One way of doing this is the approach taken here of simply announcing that current legislation would be amended as necessary. However, a more creative, and possibly more successful, approach may be to propose the introduction of primary legislation to compel all parties to impose such lists and, as a result, amending or supplanting all existing legislation on the subject.</p>

                    <p>There are 650 Members of Parliament, overwhelmingly in the forties and fifties. Recent years have seen some progress in improving the representation of women and ethnic minorities at Westminster &ndash; a process that, while rocky, has broadly been seen as positive. It has been seen as a positive shift, almost regardless of the individuals concerned, the fact that many of them have made significant contributions to public life might almost be seen as an added bonus to their making it more representative.</p>
<p>Yet one glaring area remains unchecked in the Commons, that of age. The representatives of the nation, in this regard more than any, do not represent the nation. It is worth addressing why this is important. Some might say that parliamentarians should be capable first and foremost and representative second &ndash; that misses the point, the Civil Service is there to provide expertise and deliver policies, the legislature &ndash; in this case Westminster &ndash; is there to bring the experience and understanding of the electorate to bear on those policies.</p>
<p>The AWS experience of 1997 demonstrated that shortlists across 50% of winnable constituencies works as a method of radically changing the face of politics<sup><a href="/print/41592#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup>. In this regard proposition is proposing the introduction of primary legislation to impose a threshold on all parties and keep it in place for subsequent elections. As new people enter other parts of the workforce, their voices should be represented in parliament.</p>

                    <p>At no point has anyone suggested that the great strength of MPs should be that they are entirely typical of their constituents. The system works because we elect people who can do the job rather than electing people who are a fair cross-section of society. Indeed the idea is that they aren&rsquo;t a cross section of society but remarkable people with a passion for public service and the ability to deliver. Nobody is claiming that always happens but it is hard to see how this would make it more likely.</p>

                    <p>People, of course, get older. To prevent todays spring chickens becoming tomorrow&rsquo;s dinosaurs there is a lot to be said for compelling parties to introduce young faces at each generation. Not only would this ensure that, over time, all age groups were represented but it would also act as an encouragement for parties to move on with their ideas as, ultimately, some of those who had become stuck in the rut would need to move on.</p>
<p>Parliament too often becomes a reactionary force; frequently only adapting to new ideas years or decades after they have been widely accepted in the rest of society. This is most marked in social issues such as people&rsquo;s attitudes towards gay marriage<sup><a href="/print/41592#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>At the moment there is only a considerable shift in representation in the event of a massive electoral shift &ndash; such as 1997 &ndash; requiring parties to constantly introduce fresh blood would serve to keep them in touch with all voters, not just young one, rather than ossifying in the Westminster bubble.</p>

                    <p>This proposal would also undermine the possibility for the accumulation of experience. As well as experience brought from decades of experience in a life before politics, parliamentarians then tend to specialise, through their committee work or particular passions &ndash; often based on their previous experience &ndash; which takes years to accumulate. This is particularly important in terms of the balance between the Executive and backbenchers who only have their knowledge base as a tool. Proposition&rsquo;s &lsquo;fresh blood&rsquo; would be on the walls as ministers with teams of advisers and civil servants made short work of inexperienced MPs. At a time when parliamentary power is at a low it is hard to see how this would help matters. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>One of the allegations often thrown at the idea of younger parliamentarians is that they lack experience. This is clearly not dependent on age as the allegations of lacking real life experience are currently being hurled at most of the cabinet demonstrate and therefore seems an unfair basis on which to exclude younger people<sup><a href="/print/41592#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, there is a benefit that is often overlooked, what may be described as experience by some could be considered vested interests by others. Young people have had considerably less time to become enmeshed in a certain way of doing things or to accept the sectorial interests of certain groups as normative<sup><a href="/print/41592#sdendnote2sym" name="sdendnote2anc"><sup>ii</sup></a></sup>. How being open minded to many approaches is not preferable to being closed-minded and assuming that the world is made up of wealthy white lawyers seems simply perverse.</p>
<p><a href="/print/41592#sdendnote1anc" name="sdendnote1sym">i</a> Quite a few of the current cabinet have faced questions either about their lack of experience before politics or their personal wealth. The chancellor has often faced both. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/9426424/George-Osborne-is-a-work-experience-Chancellor-who-should-be-moved-in-reshuffle-says-senior-Lib-Dem.html">Here</a> is one of many articles on the subject.</p>

                    <p>All politicians come to the job with certain assumptions and interest in particular sectors or issues. It goes with the territory of people with an interest in public life seeking office. It is surely preferable that they have a degree of experience over which of these work and which don&rsquo;t rather than presenting a blank slate. That isn&rsquo;t impartiality, it is nativity, which could be quickly captured by those experienced vested interests.</p>

                    <p>Local people have little enough chance to realistically impact the outcome of elections. In many safe seats a change is only likely every twenty or thirty years. Giving local parties a free hand in selecting the candidate at least introduces some degree of local involvement. Surely it should be up to local parties and then the electorate to decide whether they want to be represented by someone in their twenties. It isn&rsquo;t impossible for them to run &ndash; there&rsquo;s no law or regulation preventing it. It just happens that they tend not to be selected or, where they are, tend not to get in. That&rsquo;s not unrepresentative, that&rsquo;s democracy. If this is to affect all parties for their winnable seats, that would mean marginal were all of the likely candidates where in their twenties. That seems a bit rough on those voters who would rather chose an older candidate<sup><a href="/print/41592#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup>.</p>

                    <p>Leaving the decision to a cabal of local party officials to select one of their own is an interesting way of going about rejuvenating British democracy. When younger people are turning away from the traditional structures of politics &ndash; youth membership is down in all three main parties &ndash; leaving the decision on selecting candidates to groups who rarely reflect that group would seem to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

                    <p>There are only so many seats up for grabs. Short of a landslide there are probably between twenty and fifty seats available in most elections. In many of these instances, local candidates will have been working hard on the ground for many years &ndash; as activists and councillors &ndash; it is simply unfair to ignore that work in favour of someone who may have little or no experience and hasn&rsquo;t had time to even prove their association to the party or their understanding of the local area.</p>
<p>None of the major parties has failed to contest a seat in ordinary circumstances in decades so the available seats are going to have to come from somewhere. It will end up as another example of imposition by a central party machine &ndash; an issue that dogged Blair throughout AWS, namely that he was using it as an opportunity to get rid of &lsquo;troublesome&rsquo; activists and candidates.</p>

                    <p>This is reminiscent of a, possibly apocryphal, question put to Claire Short. She was asked &ldquo;Surely it is ability and not gender that ought to decide who is selected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered simply, &ldquo;Why, it never has been in the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same applies here, the idea that there is not a single young person in hundreds of constituencies that could handle the job &ndash; when people in their twenties handle complicated jobs in other areas of life, is statistically fantastically unlikely.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The point of a representative democracy is that the elected represent the entire constituency rather than just a core of people whom they happen to be similar to.</p>
<p>By the logic of Propositions arguments, there should also be quotas for class<sup><a href="/print/41592#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup>, religion, educational standards and so forth. Indeed class makes the most sense, with a salary of nearly &pound;100,000 MPs become middle class &ndash; with above average wealth - fairly quickly. Imposing representation of the poor and the working class onto them on a regular basis would do a great deal to ensure representation for the majority of people in the UK.</p>
