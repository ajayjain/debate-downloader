    <h1 class="print-title">This House Believes the US is Justified in Using Force to Prevent States From Acquiring Nuclear Weapons</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has been a concern from almost before the first atomic bomb was developed, when a number of scientists on the Manhattan Project suggested that the weapons be placed under the control of the United Nations. Since that time there has been a constant fear that unstable nations will acquire access to them.</p><p>The identity of these states changes by the decade. During the late 1950s and early 1960s there were fears in both the United States and the Soviet Union over the prospect of Maoist China developing Nuclear weapons. In the 1970s the Shah’s Nuclear Program in Iran gave cause for concern, as did programs in Taiwan and South Africa. In the 1980s Argentina and Brazil competed to develop them.</p><p>The current discussion mainly focuses on three countries. Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons, but may or may not be able to control them. North Korea which likely already has them, but also is not known for its commitment to international peace and stability. And finally Iran, which again is pursuing an aggressive program.</p><p>The Legal international framework governing the development of Nuclear weapons is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968, which has been signed by most countries and bans the development of nuclear weapons, but not of nuclear power. The question of whether or not a state can withdraw from the accords has been the subject of a prolonged international debate. In theory, a nation can leave with three months’ notice, if its vital interests are at stake. Israel, Pakistan and India are currently outside of the treaty.</p><p>This motion can likely be run in a range of ways, ranging from being a general philosophical motion, to mentioning certain countries (ie. Iran) specifically, or a specific scenario (a collapse of the Pakistani state, which would be its own debate). This article will focus on the general discussion with one or two points specific to Iran noted separately.</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

                    <p>The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&nbsp;is one of the lynchpins on which the current Western-led international political and diplomatic order is dependent.<sup>1,2</sup> Just as any normal legal system requires laws that are predictable and enforceable, so too does the international system. The Non-Proliferation Treaty provides this level of consistency and control over states’ nuclear assets.</p><p>In particular, one of those key principles is the assumption that once a country enters a treaty it will abide by its terms. If a country can leave a treaty at will, it means that no policy can be made with any degree of predictability. States are not able to formulate plans for future policies and development strategies if analysts and politicians are prevented from making reliable predictions about neighbouring state’s behaviour, economic policies and territorial ambitions.</p><p>This is particularly important with treaties relating to armaments, and of vital importance when it comes to Nuclear Weapons, because other countries choose to participate in military alliances and actions based on such assumptions.</p><p>Historically, arms build-ups and wars have occurred when the Great Powers fail to uphold the international legal system – fail to regard it as binding and inherently valuable and consequential. For example Germany’s willingness to disregard Czechoslovakian sovereignty prior to World War II. For that reason the United States has a vested interest in upholding the principles of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This is because the US is the major beneficiary of the present international system, both economically and politically.</p><p>Economically, the major loser in any upheaval around the world is almost guaranteed to be the United States or its corporations. However, the political incentives for the USA to continue upholding the non-proliferation treaty- by force if necessary- are far greater. A failure on its part to act will not just lead to nuclear proliferation, but also undermine other treaties banning chemical weapons and guaranteeing human rights as nations’ realize they are only pieces of paper.</p><p>1. ‘The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons’, 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),&nbsp; 1 July 1968, <a href="http://www.un.org/en/conf/npt/2005/npttreaty.html" title="http://www.un.org/en/conf/npt/2005/npttreaty.html">http://www.un.org/en/conf/npt/2005/npttreaty.html</a></p><p>2.

                    <p>The reality is that it makes far more sense for the United States to legitimatise actions it might take to prevent a state like Iran from developing nuclear by making reference to the uses that might find for a nuclear device, rather than the fact that they are have breached the terms of highly tenuous body of law.</p><p>While it may be true that the development of nuclear weapons is banned by international treaty, and that this treaty is recognised as a valid international legal instrument, it is far from clear whether it is in the United State’s interests to embrace either this specific version of International Law, or whether it should be the enforcer even if it does.&nbsp; For one thing, the current international legal system bans Iran from developing Nuclear weapons, but also bans Brazil from developing them. Consistency would obligate the US to actively prevent Brazil from developing a nuclear deterrent, by using threats and sanctions similar to those that have deployed against Iran. However,– common sense would argue that this would be both futile and counter-productive, since it would not only be difficult but result in enormous costs, both militarily and in terms of the reputation of the US. The alternative- granting an exception to Brazil, comparable to those previously granted to India, Pakistan and Israel-, India in particular now wishes to not just be an exception by join the NPT as a weapons state,&nbsp;would undermine those very legal standards that the government argues in favour of.<sup>1</sup></p><p>After all, Brazil is unlikely to use such weapons aggressively, and the acquisition of such weapons by a regional hegemon(like Brazil) is unlikely to change the balance of power. It should be noted that most of the rising “responsible” regional hegemon like Brazil and South Africa opposed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program,<a href="/print/17836#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> out of risk of enshrining a legal precedent.</p><p>Furthermore, even if the US chooses to cleave to the premise that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty should be enforced as a matter of law rather than of policy, it is unclear why the US alone should take on the burden of its enforcement. As Afghanistan and Iraq have demonstrated, even disarming and politically reforming countries that lack a nuclear deterrent is a financially and politically ruinous process – one that cannot be achieved without the support of allies and intergovernmental organisations. Furthermore, given the reaction against the US in international opinion,<a href="/print/17836#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> it’s worth asking whether or not the cure is worse than the cold when it comes to American influence around the world.</p><div><a href="/print/17836#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Fidler, David P., and Ganguly, Sumit, ‘India Wants to Join the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a Weapons State’, <em>YaleGlobal</em>, 27 January 2010, <a href="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/india-wants-join-non-proliferation-treaty" title="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/india-wants-join-non-proliferation-treaty">http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/india-wants-join-non-proliferation-tr...</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17836#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Charbonneau, Louis, ‘Q+A: How likely are new U.S. sanctions against Iran?’, <em>Reuters</em>, 9 November 2011, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-iran-nuclear-sanctions-idUSTRE7A86Z220111109" title="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-iran-nuclear-sanctions-idUSTRE7A86Z220111109">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-iran-nuclear-sanctions-idUS...</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17836#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Pew Global Attitudes Project, ‘Opinion of the United States’, <em>Pew Research Center</em>, 2011, <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/database/?indicator=1" title="http://www.pewglobal.org/database/?indicator=1">http://www.pewglobal.org/database/?indicator=1</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>This would be an argument in favour of preventing countries from developing any deterrent at any time, because it would make them easier to invade. It presumes, firstly, that it would be a good thing for the United States to be able to invade countries that do things it does not like at will, and secondly that it assumes that deterrence will not deter the initial invasion in the first place.</p><p>The main reason why great powers involve themselves in wars, is because many smaller countries are not able to fight off larger ones using their own resources and so the great power expects an easy victory assuming it can avoid intervention by other great powers. Jammu and Kashmir could not stand up to the Indian army in 1947 and Kuwait could not stand up to Iraq; Georgian was unable to mount armed resistance against a Russian incursion and neither was Chechnya.</p><p>Nuclear Weapons are a great equalizer, and if one consequence of Iran developing Nuclear weapons is that all of her neighbours do so as well, then war will become far less likely, and US intervention will become unnecessary. As a consequence, in the long-run, Nuclear proliferation is a self-correcting problem.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty is inherently unfair, in that it prevents countries that did not have nuclear weapons as of 1964 from developing them, but makes no effort to force those who already possess nuclear devices to disarm.</p><p>The result is that the list of countries with such weapons, the United States, Russia, Britain, France, and China, represents the balance of power as it existed at the time that the non-proliferation treaty was drafted. Countries that have entered the club subsequently, like India and Pakistan, did so in violation of the treaty and international law.</p><p>Any sort of treaty that seeks to limit access to nuclear arms has to provide opportunities for countries like Brazil to enter the “club” as they gain political or economic power. In the absence of any such mechanism the current treaty system is nothing more than a tool of Western dominance in order to keep the status quo which is favorable to the current nuclear powers something which is bound to build up resentment.</p><p>This would in effect offer not only to the pursuit of nuclear weapons by the targeted regimes, but to the rest of their policies. States like South Africa and Brazil already find it difficult to support a strong international line against Iran<a href="/print/17836#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> due to seeing the inequality of allowing some countries nuclear weapons programmes but seeking to punish others, especially when the nuclear weapons states that are signatories to the NPT have not moved towards disarmament as the treaty stipulates.<a href="/print/17836#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This would in effect alienate them completely.</p><p>Second, even if the harm was justifiable by the ends, it would seem that in the long run, invading- or even censuring- every country that attempts to develop Nuclear Weapons in violation of the NPT is impractical as the United States and the rest of the world have de facto admitted by ending sanctions on Pakistan and India in 2001, two years after their nuclear tests.<a href="/print/17836#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> As such, there needs to be a political means that can separate states like Brazil from states like Iran, lest the policy collapse under its own weight.</p><p>The West, rather than using force, should attempt to repair the existing non-proliferation treaty framework, such that the standards for possession of nuclear weapons are based on behaviour rather than history.</p><div><a href="/print/17836#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Charbonneau, Louis, ‘Q+A: How likely are new U.S. sanctions against Iran?’, <em>Reuters</em>, 9 November 2011, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-iran-nuclear-sanctions-idUSTRE7A86Z220111109">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-iran-nuclear-sanctions-idUSTRE7A86Z220111109</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17836#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Spektor, Matias, ‘How to Read Brazil’s Stance on iran’, <em>YaleGlobal</em>, 16 March 2010, <a href="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/how-read-brazils-stance-iran" title="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/how-read-brazils-stance-iran">http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/how-read-brazils-stance-iran</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17836#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> BBC News, ‘US lifts India and Pakistan sanctions’, 23 September 2001, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1558860.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1558860.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1558860.stm</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

It may be true that the treaty should be revisited in the case of say India or Brazil, but this debate is not about the nuclear ambitions of fundamentally stable, democratic states that would willingly comply with all of the terms of the non-proliferation treaty if they were permitted to become signatories. Rather, the question of America’s right to act to enforce the treaty should focus on rogue states that present a significant danger to their neighbours, and whose acquisition of such weapons is likely to destabilize regional balances of power, and make the entire world less secure. Iran, Syria and Pakistan’s use of the language of anti-colonialism is a sign of nothing more than political opportunism.</p>        </div>

                    <p>States are fundamentally rational, and as such, nuclear proliferation has generally made war less likely, by promulgating the principle of mutually assured destruction (MAD).</p><p>States go to war with other states when they think they can win the conflict they will provoke. By making victory impossible, MAD makes wars unprofitable, and thereby prevents them from beginning in the first place. The Cold War never turned hot partially for this reason, and it is possible that the Israeli-Iranian relationship could be stabilized by both states possessing a nuclear deterrent. North Korea may well desire to Nuke the United States and Japan, and may well feel that there would be no moral issues with doing so, but they have refrained from doing so. As they have refrained from invading the South since 1950. There is substantial evidence that even the most irrational regimes can be deterred.

A “second Strike” ability means that a country has the capacity to nuke another country after it has already been attacked, whether through hardened silos or submarine launched warheads. Without such an ability, a state like Israel would risk losing its nuclear deterrent in an Iranian attack, and would therefore have every incentive to strike first if it thought such an attack might be about to occur. Iran, which is far less likely to be able to develop a “Second Strike” capability due to financial and technological limitations, would in turn almost constantly face a “use it or lose it” situation of its own.</p><div><a href="/print/17836#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Myers, B.R., ‘Excerpt: The Cleanest Race’, <em>The New York Times</em>, 26 January 2010, &nbsp;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/books/excerpt-cleanest-race.html?pagewanted=all</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
