                    <p>Prohibition is not the answer, especially not in countries such as the USA where gun ownership is such an entrenched aspect of society. Banning guns would not make them disappear or make them any less dangerous. It is a legitimate right of citizens to own weapons with which they can protect themselves, their family, and their property (see point 4). Many people also need guns for other reasons. For example, farmers need guns in order to protect their stock and crops from pests, e.g. rabbits, birds, deer, foxes, stray dogs attacking sheep, etc.</p>        </div>

Legally held guns are stolen and end up in the hands of criminals, who would have greater difficulty in obtaining such weapons if firearms were less prevalent in society. Guns also end up in the hands of children, leading to tragic accidents and terrible disasters such as the Columbine High School massacre in the U.S.A. Sometimes even normal-seeming registered gun owners appear to go mad and kill, as tragically happened at Hungerford and Dunblaine in the U.K.</p>        </div>

In the vast majority of crimes involving firearms, the gun used is not legally held or registered. Many of illegal weapons are imported secretly from abroad, or converted from replica firearms rather than being stolen from registered owners.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Shooting is a major sport enjoyed by many law-abiding people, both in gun clubs with purpose-built ranges and as a field sport. These people have the right to continue with their chosen leisure pursuit, on which they have spent large amounts of money – an investment the government would effectively be confiscating if their guns were confiscated. In addition, field sports bring money into poor rural economies and provide a motivation for landowners to value environmental protection. While compensation could be given the cost would be huge; in the UK shootings value to the economy was £1.6billion in 2004.<a href="/print/17894#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17894#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> ‘£1,600,000,000 – the value of shooting’, <em>Shooting Times</em>, 27 September 2006, <a href="http://www.shootingtimes.co.uk/news/96001/pound1600000000__the_value_of_shooting.html" title="http://www.shootingtimes.co.uk/news/96001/pound1600000000__the_value_of_shooting.html">http://www.shootingtimes.co.uk/news/96001/pound1600000000__the_value_of_...</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
