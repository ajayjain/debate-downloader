    <h1 class="print-title">This house believes states are justified in waging war in response to terrorist acts</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the most significant threats to international security now purportedly come from non-state actors, particularly global terrorists. Counterterrorism has become one of the key objectives of Western security policies. Even before the September 11 attacks, the United States targeted Al Qaeda following the Twin Tower bombings and attacks on the US embassy in Kenya. Bombs were dropped on alleged Al Qaeda training camps and states that were believed to harbor terrorists were threatened with coercive measures. However, it was only after the September 11 attacks that a significantly more hawkish counterterrorism strategy took shape. Not only was the use of force central to this new strategy, but so was the initiation of war and even the invasion and occupation of countries that were believed to support or harbor terrorists. The Afghanistan war epitomised this shift in strategy, but the new doctrine also influenced thinking on the invasion of Iraq, with many security experts warning of a potential alliance between dictators such as Saddam Hussein and international terrorists that sought Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs). Those that champion war as a means to fighting international terrorism argue that allowing states to support or harbor terrorists endangers national security and makes terrorist attacks far more likely. Invasion can be effective in disrupting terrorist networks and cutting international terrorists off from the states that provide them with resources or sanctuaries. Moreover, by engaging in &#39;nation-building,&#39; Western nations can combat the social roots of terrorism by promoting democracy, alleviating poverty, tackling human rights abuses, empowering women, and discrediting extremist ideologies. However, critics argue that invading other countries only increases the risk of terrorism. Occupying foreign lands, killing civilians through military action, and trying to implement Western forms of democracy only strengthens the recruitment base of terrorist organisations. Furthermore, invasions and occupations are far too costly for the public and economy to endure. International police action, and not invasion, is the only suitable method for tackling global terrorism.</p>

                    <p>Invasions and subsequent occupations have limited domestic and international support. For example, the Washington Post has reported that two-thirds of Americans now believe that the war in Afghanistan is not worth fighting<sup>1</sup>. International polls also suggest a substantial global decrease in support for the "war on terror", with America's image in the world suffering as a result<sup>2</sup>. Future invasions are therefore likely to be extremely unpopular options in the arena of domestic and international opinion, which will also significantly compromise their success if they are launched.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.ongo.com/v/582620/-1/685DAD3D89C0C12A/publics-support-for-afghanistan-war-fading">http</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span><a href="http://www.ongo.com/v/582620/-1/685DAD3D89C0C12A/publics-support-for-afghanistan-war-fading">://www.ongo.com/v/582620/-1/685DAD3D89C0C12A/publics-support-for-afghanistan-war-fading</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span><br><sup>2</sup><a href="http://pewglobal.org/2007/03/14/americas-image-in-the-world-findings-from-the-pew-global-attitudes-project/">http</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span><a href="http://pewglobal.org/2007/03/14/americas-image-in-the-world-findings-from-the-pew-global-attitudes-project/">://pewglobal.org/2007/03/14/americas-image-in-the-world-findings-from-the-pew-global-attitudes-project </a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Support for the war on terror only began to ebb when George W. Bush initiated the Iraq war, which proved to have no real relevance to fighting terrorism, and in fact intensified the terrorist threat. Similarly, support for the Afghanistan war has decreased substantially because it has lost its initial purpose. If a future invasion is well-planned and articulated and conducted specifically in response to terrorist attacks and threats, it is likely to have broad support. Moreover, people will also be more willing to bear the financial costs because of the importance of national security concerns. Invasion in response to terrorism can therefore still be an effective and popular option.</p>        </div>

                    <p>As Tony Blair’s former special adviser to foreign affairs Robert Cooper has argued, failed “pre-modern” states – those without a domestic monopoly on the use of force and stable state institutions – pose significant threats to international peace and security because they can provide a base for non-state actors (including terrorists) to plan and launch attacks without a hindrance. Invasion, or “defensive imperialism” (Afghanistan providing an example), may be the only effective response to this threat [1]. The instability in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, for example, made it impossible to rely on the Afghanistan government to pursue Al Qaeda. Furthermore, the Taliban effectively inferred Al Qaeda with governmental functions, including the projection of force abroad [2]. In cases such as this, interstate cooperation is ineffectual and armed action may be necessary. Even more alarming still is the possibility of “rogue states” cooperating with international terrorists, and allowing terrorist groups to acquire Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) or chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons. Pre-emptive military action can protect against these threats [3]. Invasion can also act as a deterrent to other regimes thinking of supporting terrorism as it demonstrates to them that allowing attacks upon other countries will result in massive retaliation and the swift overthrow of the sponsoring regime.&nbsp;</p><p>[1]&nbsp;Robert Cooper, ‘Why we still need empires’, <em>The Observer</em>, Sunday 7 April 2002 [<a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,680117,00.html">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,680117,00.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span>].

                    <p>There is scant evidence to suggest that failed states provide the conditions for terrorism to prosper. While a few ‘failed states’ have provided a base for terrorists, the vast majority have not [1]. Moreover, in several key states that can be regarded as ‘failed’ or ‘failing’ and where terrorists operate – including Yemen and Pakistan – invasion has not been necessary. In these states the US and its allies have built relationships with the countries’ ruling regimes and have undertaken highly effective methods short of invasion – such as drone attacks and the raid on Bin Laden’s compound – which have significantly weakened terrorist networks. Finally, while terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda may have a desire to use unconventional weapons such as CBRNs, there is very little evidence or proof to suggest that they have the capability to execute successful attacks. Indeed, the use of unconventional weapons by terrorist groups is rare [2].&nbsp;</p><p>[1] For example, see Christopher A.

                    <p>Article 51 of the U.N. Charter upholds a state's right to use force in self-defense against states that harbor terrorists. Article 51 makes reference to a state's fundamental right to self-defense, and allows states to undertake certain measures in the event of an armed attack. Allies may also assist in "collective self-defense"<sup>1</sup>. In the case of Afghanistan, the United States and its allies made distinct references to Article 51 in justifying military action against the Taliban regime<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, invasion in response to terrorism can be legal under international law if, as in Afghanistan, it is initiated in self-defense and designed to deter future attacks.</p><p><sup>1</sup>U.N.

                    <p>It is evident that war against states that purportedly harbor terrorists is unlikely to satisfy the requirements of Article 51 in anything other than very narrow and exceptional circumstances. Self-defense claims are only valid if an attack is imminent or ongoing. Terrorist attacks are often sporadic and the intelligence on future attacks is usually unspecific, and therefore waging a war in response to terrorism does not meet the criteria for self-defense. States such as Afghanistan that purportedly "harbor" terrorists can also not be regarded as "aggressors" and "perpetrators". This would require that states instrumentally use terrorist groups to attack other states, rather than simply "harboring" them and even having knowledge of their intent. Moreover, invasion can only be legal where armed force is the only available means of self-defense. In the case of terrorism, war is unlikely to be the 'last resort'. International police action and criminal prosecution of terrorists represent alternative and more effective options, but these were deliberately neglected when war was launched against Afghanistan<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&amp;context=vulr">http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&amp;context=vulr</a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>The substantial civilian casualties that are likely to result from invasions, as well as the presence of foreign military occupiers, inevitably leads to the populations of invaded countries (and their sympathisers) regarding the military presence as a form of imperialism. This may also lead many to join militant groups. For example, several studies and polls have shown that civilian casualties brought about in particular by Western airstrikes have led to a significant drop in support for international forces among the Afghan people, with many joining the insurgency or providing it with moral or material support. Even Afghan President Hamid Karzai has strongly lamented the civilian casualties and warned international forces that they are seen as occupiers<sup>1</sup>. Indeed, Ill-considered action against Afghanistan has made the USA in particular, and the West in general more widely feared and hated. A brutal campaign increased sympathy for the Taliban and Bin Laden, especially in Islamic countries. This in itself seriously increases the risk of future terrorist attacks, but it also threatens moderate and pro-western regimes throughout the Islamic world. In particular, it could seriously destabilise nuclear-armed Pakistan where the pro-USA stance of the military government routinely causes widespread and sometimes violent protest. Any future invasion in response to a terrorist threat or attack is likely to heighten these tensions.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2009/02/civilian-casualties-undermining-afghanistan-war-effort-says-report">http</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span><a href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2009/02/civilian-casualties-undermining-afghanistan-war-effort-says-report">://motherjones.com/mojo/2009/02/civilian-casualties-undermining-afghanistan-war-effort-says-report </a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>While collateral damage is always regrettable, it is an inevitable feature of modern warfare. Moreover, improved military technology (for example precision bombing) and strategic planning to avoid civilian deaths has significantly reduced the risk of civilian casualties<sup>1</sup>. Indeed, in Afghanistan it is insurgent groups that are primarily responsible for civilian deaths, with international forces accounting for a proportionately limited number of casualties. A recent report by the UN found that 80% of the civilian casualties this year are attributable to insurgents<sup>2</sup>. Finally, although invasions can sometimes be unpopular, they may be necessary if a country suffers a significant terrorist attack and faces a continued, imminent, and substantial risk of future attacks.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://essays.ssrc.org/sept11/essays/falk.htm">http</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span><a href="http://essays.ssrc.org/sept11/essays/falk.htm">://essays.ssrc.org/sept11/essays/falk.htm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39036&amp;Cr=Afghan&amp;Cr1">http</a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span><a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39036&amp;Cr=Afghan&amp;Cr1">://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39036&amp;Cr=Afghan&amp;Cr1</a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>As military historian Michael Howard argued following the September 11 attacks, international terrorists should be brought to justice through international police action under the auspices of the United Nations, and should face an international court, be awarded a fair trial and be given the appropriate punishment. Launching invasions and conducting "wars" on terror merely legitimises terrorists as war combatants rather than criminals, and negatively affects the legitimacy of states that undertake invasions and often resort to breaching international law. Not only are wars and invasions an ineffective response to terrorism, but they also offer terrorists the protection of the laws of war and allow them to exploit breaches of international law for propaganda purposes, thereby strengthening their recruitment base and political relevance<sup>1</sup>. Several studies have also demonstrated that, historically, military responses to terrorism have a very poor success rate. The Afghanistan war epitomises this failure, with many policymakers and security experts now recognizing that only a political solution to the conflict, consisting of negotiations with the Taliban, is workable<sup>2</sup>.</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57615/michael-howard/whats-in-a-name-how-to-fight-terrorism">http</a> <span class="print-footnote">[13]</span><a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57615/michael-howard/whats-in-a-name-how-to-fight-terrorism">://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57615/michael-howard/whats-in-a-name-how-to-fight-terrorism</a> <span class="print-footnote">[13]</span></p><p><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG741.html"> http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG741.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>International police action is not always sufficient enough to tackle the threat of terrorism. For example, where a state harbors terrorists, it is unlikely to cooperate in any international police effort, even if it faces sanctions or international condemnation. Moreover, unstable weak states are unlikely to have the capacity to pursue terrorists. Both of these reasons convinced Western policymakers that only an invasion of Afghanistan was a practical option in fighting Al Qaeda after September 11. If similar conditions exist around a future significant terrorist attack, invasion may be the only practical option.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Properly planned and justified invasions in response to terrorist attacks can command high levels of support. For example, support for the war in Afghanistan was very high in the initial stages of the war because people accepted that invading Afghanistan and dismantling the Taliban regime was the only realistic option for destroying the Al Qaeda networks responsible for the September 11 attacks. Nations waging war always have to pay for the cost of the invasion, so that cost does not constitute a reason why starting a war specifically in response to terrorism is a bad idea.

                    <p>Nation-building has been a central element of post-invasion planning for the Afghanistan and Iraq invasions, as well as possible future wars. In Afghanistan in particular, invasion coupled with subsequent nation building has been successful in constructing relatively stable political institutions and promoting economic development. In addition, efforts have been made to promote women's rights and tackle extremist ideology. While the military element of invasion can forcefully disrupt terrorist networks and deter future attacks, nation-building can complement invasion through effectively tackling many of the social roots of terrorism by building stable and legitimate political and economic institutions to facilitate democratic governance and economic growth.

                    <p>Nation-building exercises are likely to fail, are far too costly, and do not reduce the threat from terrorism. Moreover, there is not an inherent threat of terrorism from weak states, and where one may be present, it can be tackled through existing institutional capacity without the need for invasion or nation-building. Arguments for nation-building also rest on very debatable assumptions – for example that the roots of terrorism lie in poverty and lack of education (which is contradicted by the relatively wealthy status of many Al Qaeda operatives), and false analogies to the Marshall Plan and European reconstruction after World War II [1]. In Afghanistan, nation-building has been a dismal failure, with high levels of corruption crippling the country’s political and economic institutions, and warlords controlling large swaths of the country while continuing many of the misogynistic and violent practices of their Taliban predecessors [2].&nbsp;</p><p>[1] Gery T.

                    <p>The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated that major powers will use the pretext of fighting terrorism to pursue narrow geopolitical and strategic objectives. Thus, while the official rationale of the Iraq war was the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's alleged WMDs and his possible links with Al Qaeda, the true motives involved controlling the region's oil supply and establishing a base in one of the world's most geopolitically valuable regions. Similarly, the Afghanistan war has not merely focused on fighting Al Qaeda, but also on establishing a strong presence in Central Asia and securing key gas and oil pipelines<sup>1</sup>. The lexicon of 'failed', 'weak', and 'rogue' states has also been used to pressure various 'unfriendly' states that have no connection to terrorism<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, it is likely that narrow interests that go far beyond fighting terrorism will influence the planning for any future invasion.</p><p><sup>1</sup>Ahmed Rashid, Taliban: Islam, Oil and the New Great Game in Central Asia (London, 2000).

                    <p>It is inevitable that certain geopolitical and strategic objectives will be incorporated into the planning of any war. However, with respect to genuine invasions in response to terrorism (such as Afghanistan), these influences will be secondary and will not hamper counterterrorism efforts. The argument that the Afghanistan war was launched primarily to secure oil pipelines is ill-informed and ignores the broad international support for the war and the extent to which the invasion was motivated by the aim of destroying Al Qaeda following the shocking September 11 terrorist attacks.</p>        </div>
