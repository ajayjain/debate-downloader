    <h1 class="print-title">This House would ignore North Korean provocations</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>For its size and wealth North Korea gets a lot of international attention. It regularly gets into the media around the world and is the subject of numerous high powered rounds of talks and discussions in the Security Council. Yet despite all the attention North Korea gets from the press, diplomats, and policymakers North Korea also regularly seems to get its own way in negotiations and its on-going brinkmanship with the rest of the world despite the obvious disparities between the North Korean state and even its southern adversary let along the United States.</p>
<p>North Korea, formally the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, occupies the northern half of the Korean Peninsula which was divided at the 38<sup>th</sup> parallel at the end of the Second World War with the northern half administered by the Soviet Union while the south was administered by the United States. The Soviet Union handed over control to the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic in 1948. War between the two Koreas in the early 1950s did not resolve the split and today Korea is one of the few areas where the Cold War continues.</p>
<p>North Korea is small, at 120,000km<sup>2</sup> slightly smaller than the US state of Mississippi, is mostly mountainous, has a relatively small population of 24.5 million people who are extremely poor with GDP per capita at purchasing power parity of $1,800.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The attention this country gets is therefore completely out of proportion with the importance that would normally be given a country of similar size and wealth, for example Cambodia.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> North Korea&rsquo;s influence comes from several factors;</p>
<ul>
<li>Its strategic location as both buffer zone and potentially a bridge between three great powers &ndash; Japan, China, and Russia.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> The United States is also closely interested as a result of alliances with Japan and South Korea</li>
<li>As a country building a nuclear weapons capability</li>
<li>Being the most militarised country on earth &ndash; with the potential to cause huge casualties as a result of being in artillery range of South Korea&rsquo;s capital Seoul.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></li>
<li>North and South Korea having never agreed a peace treaty and having huge military forces along the border between them meaning even small incidents could blow up into a large scale conventional war.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should the great powers in the region simply ignore the regime and continue business as usual when these intermittent provocations occur?</p>

                    <p>The two Koreas should be able to solve the situation themselves without recourse to all the neighbouring powers &ndash; whose interest does not seem to have spurred a solution to the frozen conflict anyway. With the Cold War over South Korea is more than capable of handling its own security. South Korea is economically far ahead of the North with its economy thirty seven times bigger.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Its military is also more capable than the North&rsquo;s as the International Institute for Strategic Studies argues &ldquo;As measured by static equipment indices, South Korea&rsquo;s conventional forces would appear superior to North Korea&rsquo;s. When morale, training, equipment maintenance, logistics, and reconnaissance and communications capabilities are factored in, this qualitative advantage increases.&rdquo;<a href="/print/44867#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> So should be able to deter aggression on its own and pull its own weight in negotiations without the need of a multilateral process. Moreover no one would argue that an invasion should be ignored however the South should be the one who responds to North Korean actions on its own.</p>

                    <p>Pressure from other states acts as a force multiplier helping to show that the North has crossed a line with its actions.

                    <p>North Korea has an attention seeking cycle on the go that was used by Kim Jong Il and now seems to be used by his son Kim Jong Un. Essentially North Korea takes a provocative action (as big or small as it thinks necessary &ndash; this may be a missile launch, right up to some kind of military attack) in order to grab the world&rsquo;s attention. There is then a period where there are condemnations and threats to increase sanctions that usually don&rsquo;t get anywhere as they are blocked by China. The North Korean regime will then proclaim a willingness to do business and negotiate giving minor concessions on the issue of the provocation in return for aid or whatever the regime happens to want at the time. Of course whatever concession it gives is easily reversible so setting up another round.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This is a good deal for North Korea as it essentially gets aid in return for bad behaviour, it is therefore not surprising that the North is willing to continue engaging in bad behaviour.</p>

                    <p>Negotiations to defuse the cause of the immediate tension, and sanctions to encourage North Korea to the negotiating table are sensible, proportionate responses to North Korean actions.

                    <p>The responses to North Korean provocations do not bring a solution any closer. North Korea has yet to sign a peace treaty with the South and the United States. It is however particularly interested in signing a treaty with the United States rather than the South. In 2010 the North Korean foreign ministry proposed that &quot;If confidence is to be built between [North Korea] and the US, it is essential to conclude a peace treaty for terminating the state of war, a root cause of the hostile relations, to begin with&quot;.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The North wants a peace treaty with the US so as to drive a wedge between the USA and South Korea to prevent US support for the South in the event of war.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Ignoring such efforts at negotiating with the USA without South Korea in the room, and indeed all advances and provocations would force the North to accept that it has to negotiate with the south or with no one. Ignoring North Korean actions and reducing the number of allies negotiating while maintaining security guarantees prevents any chance of the North dividing the USA and South Korea.</p>

                    <p>The United States has its own interests in the North Korean question, not only does it have troops in South Korea and security guarantees to maintain with its ally but it is also concerned by nuclear proliferation.

                    <p>North Korea is an irrational and irresponsible regime that can&rsquo;t simply be ignored. As the United States National Security Council spokesman Tonny Vietor said in response to the 12<sup>th</sup> December 2012 missile test &ldquo;This action is yet another example of North Korea&#39;s pattern of irresponsible behavior.&rdquo; As a power that is willing to defy international sanctions and resolutions such as &ldquo;Resolution 1874, which demands the DPRK not to conduct &quot;any launch using ballistic missile technology&quot; and urges it to &quot;suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile programme&quot;&rdquo;<a href="/print/44867#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> it is essential that there is engagement to prevent the regime breaking more international norms.</p>
<p>It is impossible simply to ignore a regime with such a propensity to engage in provocative actions when it borders you, as is the case with China and Russia, or when it has tested missiles that can potentially hit targets 6000km away, so most of Asia, including numerous US bases.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>North Korea is not an irrational regime, and is certainly not going to use its missiles to hit one of its neighbouring great powers. North Korea has shown time and time again that its number one objective is regime survival<a href="/print/44867#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> and its provocations are one method it uses to try and ensure such survival through getting concessions and building deterrence against any possible pre-emptive attack either by the South or the United States.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> North Korea will therefore never invite such retaliation from the surrounding great powers. All provocations it takes are just to the extent that it thinks it can get away with them. It is notable that since South Korea altered its stance from &lsquo;controlled response&rsquo; to &lsquo;manifold retaliation&rsquo; in the wake of the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island<a href="/print/44867#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> the provocations from North Korea have been much less provocative i.e. missile testing rather than military actions.</p>

                    <p>Even if the provocations are sometimes relatively small and ineffective, such as the failed missile launch in April 2012, as a conflict zone they cant simply be ignored by anyone even if they themselves are unlikely to be drawn into any potential conflict. After Rwanda the United Nations promised never again would it allow genocide;<a href="/print/44867#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> how much worse would it be to ignore something that could be a spark to a conflict that could cost millions of lives when we already know there is the potential. The United Nations was created &ldquo;To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace&hellip; to bring about &hellip; settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace&rdquo;<a href="/print/44867#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> therefore all nations should be attempting to resolve this frozen conflict that could so easily become a shooting war. Wars in Korea have in the past drawn in all the surrounding powers; the Imjin war involved China and Japan, China and Japan again fought over Korea in 1894-5, and the Korean War 1950-53 brought in both the USA and China while Russia and Japan were both involved as supply bases. Clearly the possibility of conflict is not something any power with a stake in Northeast Asia can simply ignore.</p>
<p>It is essential that there is a reaction to every incident just in case that is the incident that spins out of control.</p>

                    <p>While the United Nations is about creating peace that does not mean that it needs to keep trying the same failed formula. It is clear that multilateral discussions and sanctions have not succeeded in creating positive change in relation to North Korea. Trying new tactics does not mean giving up on the goal of international peace and security.</p>

                    <p>While the great powers can try to keep on with business as usual how will this be helpful? The situation is unstable and needs to be resolved which is something that ignoring the North will not do. Commentators thought that the North would collapse as a result of the withdrawal of support that was given by the USSR in the early 1990s but it did not happen. The regime will likely be able to hang on in the status quo situation pretty much indefinitely.</p>
<p>There is also no reason to believe that the provocations may not become bigger should smaller provocations be ignored. While North Korea can attract the world&rsquo;s attention with a missile test launch it is likely to keep doing such small and relatively harmless actions. Should such actions fail the regime may resort to bigger incidents such as the sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan in 2010 which resulted in 46 deaths which may have been an attempt at coercive diplomacy against a regime that was unwilling to engage in negotiations.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>So far engagement has done little to resolve the situation in North Korea either; the regime is practically immune to pressure from those states that are willing to pressurise it. There are occasional hopes that China will put more pressure on North Korea but so far these have proven to be false hopes, and indeed China is investing heavily in North Korea, for example creating a port at Rason to serve Manchuria.<a href="/print/44867#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> When the Korean question is resolved it will be through the collapse of the regime, something that is as likely to come about through ignoring it as engaging with it.</p>
