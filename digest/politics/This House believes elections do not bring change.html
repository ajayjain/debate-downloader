    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes elections do not bring change</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Change is, obviously, a relative term. One person&rsquo;s minor alteration is another&rsquo;s revolutionary shift. However, generally in most representative democracies, including the UK change can appear relatively cosmetic. There&rsquo;s a famous bumper sticker that reads, &ldquo;If voting changed anything, they&rsquo;d abolish it&rdquo;<a href="/print/41595#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>. This statement certainly relates to a general sense among many that electoral politics is an exercise in adjusting details, which usually impact on the lives of &lsquo;ordinary people&rsquo; without ever addressing wider underlying issues that affect the structure of society as a whole.</p>
<p>For example, in a UK context, all three of the major parties have slightly different policies in relation to taxation or welfare policy but none of them have proposals that would fundamentally shift the nature of the ownership and distribution of wealth in the UK<a href="/print/41595#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>. This is the case despite the professed beliefs of those parties and their leaders; on the Right for example, the Tories speak in terms of a free market that rewards hard work and individual initiative and effort. However, such a scenario is impossible without massive changes in inheritance tax, the removal of independent education and the abolition of tariffs on unprocessed commodities &ndash; as all three of these inevitably benefit existing wealth<a href="/print/41595#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a>. All three are opposed by the party. Similar problems are found in the manifestoes of the other parties.</p>
<p>Why is this the case? Depending on who you believe there are two distinct groups of explanations. The first group of arguments would have it that those who are already powerful and wealthy have an undue influence on the political process and no interest in achieving genuine change. They use this influence to ensure that all political discourse takes place within narrow parameters that will not, ultimately, impact on their interests.</p>
<p>The other group of arguments revolve around the idea that there is a broad consensus over the structure of the state and economy and that a majority of the electorate is happy with that.<a href="/print/41595#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a> Here this group of arguments divides between those who would argue that the electorate is only happy with the status quo because they are unaware of the alternatives and others who would suggest that it is genuinely in their interest.</p>
<p>What is unquestionable is that there are major areas of political discourse that are simply never placed on the agenda at times of elections &ndash; the electoral process itself among them. Many would argue that this is both desirable and necessary as it prevents the political system being hijacked by short-termism or particular agendas. There is also a sense that there are some questions that ought never to be asked as &lsquo;everybody knows&rsquo; the outcome and the people can&rsquo;t be trusted with that sort of thing. Examples of policies that might fall into this category would be;</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The abolition of income tax, or any radical change in taxation</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suspending all immigration, or indeed throwing open the borders</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universalization (or abolition) of all benefits</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fundamentally restructuring the political process (banning multiple terms of office for MPs, abolishing the Executive branch of government, etc.)</p>
<p>One of the reasons, perhaps, that these issues are kept off the table is that they tend to be a one way street &ndash; abolishing things is easy, setting them back up again is difficult; if a country leaves the EU or NATO in one parliament, it&rsquo;s unlikely that they could just waltz back in a few years later. Another however is that because most voters want mutually exclusive things &ndash; better services AND lower taxes; a smaller state in some circumstances, a larger one in others. As a result, democratic politics tends to be an exercise in placating certain groups just a bit while, at the same time, trying not to alienate another too much.</p>
<p>Equally this tends to take place within relatively narrow confines. To take the debate over the top rate of income tax that so fascinated the UK in March 2012<a href="/print/41595#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a>. The change &ndash; a proposal to reduce the top rate of income tax from fifty to forty-five pence in the pound &ndash; was proposed as a clash of political wills over a major issue of principle and an area of clear distinction between the Conservatives and their Liberal Democrat coalition partners; apparently right versus left. All of this completely ignored several elements &ndash; for example the fact that income tax was only introduced as a temporary measure in 1799 and intended to be temporary. It was repealed again in 1816 amid agreement that it should only ever be used in times of war.<a href="/print/41595#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a> So why not abolish it altogether? The easy answer is &lsquo;because this isn&rsquo;t the 18<sup>th</sup> century and it costs money to run a modern state.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So why not propose it at election? The abolition of income taxes would certainly be popular. There may well be a mandate for it. Why not let everyone keep the money they earn and spend it as they want to &ndash; surely how they spend their money would be real democracy as people could spend their money as they wanted. Because, so the argument goes, the State plans ahead and voters don&rsquo;t. They wouldn&rsquo;t invest in things they will need in twenty years&rsquo; time so they have to be forced. Generally speaking, that applies to why most issues aren&rsquo;t up for election.</p>
<p><strong>Debaters&rsquo; Note</strong></p>
<p>Proposition need to be very careful here about how they define &lsquo;change&rsquo;. Clearly elections do change things; if nothing else they can remove a government and replace it with another. If that government did nothing at all, it would still be a change. By contrast if prop define it too widely, they&rsquo;ll be open to attack for trying to return to a &lsquo;year zero&rsquo; at every election. If, for example, the issue of whether or not Britain needs a military service were to be up for discussion at every election, it would be impossible to run one because of the amount of time it takes to train and equip service personnel. Prop needs a sense of change that allows room for the debate to breathe without covering so much territory that they will spend their whole time arguing individual policy points.</p>

                    <p>Shuffling the details around is one thing when everything is working okay but in a crisis, an electoral system designed for minor changes struggles to cope. Those who have the greatest influence over the electoral process &ndash; major donors to parties, the owners of media interests, those with privileged access &ndash; are also those least willing to surrender their benefits in the event of a crisis. As a result the two main political parties in the UK are currently fighting over who can sack more junior civil servants or axe welfare benefits the furthest. In the meantime those who caused the financial crisis in the first place are left untouched because the political system isn&rsquo;t fit for purpose<a href="/print/41595#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t incidental. The system is designed in such a way that the arguments revolve around the minor issues; for example there are only a few changes in MP&#39;s at each election as there are few marginal seats, with few changes in membership it is unlikely there will be a radical change in thinking. Cutting welfare payments has a significant effect on the poor and little real impact on the economy. The creation of a super-tax<a href="/print/41595#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> would actually do something about the financial situation but isn&rsquo;t even on the political map.</p>

<p><a href="/print/41595#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[ii]</a> A supertax is the term given to an additional tax on the wealth of the wealthy as well as their income. Britain had one until 1974, France has a new one. Article on the latter can be found <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/26/french-supertax-talent-loreal-boss">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>There will always be those who will have a greater influence than others in an electoral setting. Equally, whatever the basis of an electoral system, some will have the time and interest to do the job and others won&rsquo;t. Proposition seems unclear as to whether it objects to the system as a whole or just the results it happens to have produced at the moment.</p>

                    <p>In the most recent examples of voters in countries roughly comparable to the UK trying to do something significant with their votes &ndash; the rejection of austerity packages in southern Europe were simply swept aside as inconvenient to ruling elites<a href="/print/41595#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>.</p>
<p>The very idea that wealthy bankers who have already made millions on loans to weak economies should not get their money back is seen as impossible by those who run financial institutions and their friends in politics.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that currency speculators, market traders, brokers, hedge fund managers and others destroy companies and economies, ruining the lives of thousands, their interests are protected.</p>
<p>Whatever can be decided by elections, the major issue &ndash; that the interests of the extremely rich take precedence over everyone else &ndash; does not appear to be up for grabs. The protesters on the street seem to realise this but not in the polling booth<a href="/print/41595#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>.</p>

                    <p>Governments have to obey the law. Even when it is unpopular with their electorates. The fact that the voters who&nbsp;benefited&nbsp;from massive government borrowing are now unwilling to pay for it is not surprising but that&nbsp;doesn&#39;t&nbsp;make it justified. The very financiers who, according to prop, are so busily lining their own nests are also the people building pension funds and paying taxes for the demographic time bomb just now exploding in the UK and the rest of the developed world.</p>

                    <p>There is a saying, &ldquo;Whoever wins the election, the government stays the same.&rdquo; Never has this been more true than it is at the moment. The same clique that dominate the three major parties (same schools, same universities, same friends) also have a disproportionate influence in the civil service, the media, business and the professions.</p>
<p>Inevitably, they preserve their own interests or, at the very least, are unlikely to question certain assumptions. Out of the current cabinet, 18 of its members are millionaires, both of the governing parties parliamentary presence is white, rich, male and privately educated<a href="/print/41595#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>. The leadership on both sides of the house of Commons is dominated by the same Oxbridge background and, more worryingly, an assumption that free market, <em>laisse-faire </em>economics is the only possible solution to any problem.</p>

                    <p>What exactly is the problem with having those with both an interest and the ability to run the country doing so? The key issue is that of accountability; it&rsquo;s being able to appoint and remove governments on the basis of whether they act in the national interest that is vastly more important than whether the personnel in that government are typical of that same interest. Moreover the UK is a democracy, if the public really wanted change a minority party could be elected, that the voters vote for Labour and Conservatives time and again shows that these parties are broadly in line with what the public wants. They want small changes not the radical sort.</p>

                    <p>It is an odd phenomenon of those groups that complain that the big questions are not asked at elections that they only seem to want certain questions asked and, even then, only if the receive certain answers.</p>
<p>Democracy is only going to work if there is compromise &ndash; as a result neither those who would abolish tax nor those who would double it are likely to get their way.</p>
<p>Many of those who wish for &lsquo;real change&rsquo; &ndash; particularly on the Left - might be surprised at the likely outcomes. Historically clear polling shows &ndash; as well as the often cited death penalty<a href="/print/41595#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> - support for massive reductions in immigration and taxation, the benefits system would be unlikely to survive.

<p>Armed police, capital punishment and emasculated trade union movement and more would be considerably more likely outcomes than some kind of egalitarian utopia.</p>

                    <p>This is the greatest myth of all. Despite the best efforts of the Daily Mail,&nbsp; most people appreciate living in a multi-cultural, mostly socially democratic country. The NHS routinely tops the polls for most respected British institution &ndash; way ahead of political organisations of all stripes. Those areas over which there is no democratic control however, major financial institutions, the media, educational and financial elites tend to do less well. If Op is so happy with democratic activity on the smaller issues than why are they afraid of the good sense of the electorate in other areas?</p>

                    <p>There is plenty of room for meaningful change within the current framework of political discourse. The sale of council houses, the nationalisation and privatisation of national industries, the minimum wage, the creation of the welfare state, the removal of national service, the introduction of transparency into public and private life, equal rights in the workplace and elsewhere &ndash; all delivered within the gradualist centre that proposition is so keen to sweep away.</p>
<p>Instead, the suggestion that quintennial overhauls of all of the machinery of public life would somehow be more democratic than a steady progress in the broad direction of consensus is both untrue and unworkable. Massive lurches of policy do not reflect the national mood, they accept one part of it and ignore all other views. At the same time they allow for knee-jerk reaction before any policy has had time to work.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The very issues that Opposition highlights have, for the most part, come from the bottom up. Equal rights, transparency, fair earnings and rights in the workplace all came about as a result of pressure from grassroots organisation &ndash; usually in the teeth of established interests. When they were demonstrated as being effective, the ruling elite begrudgingly accepted them.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Politics has much more to do with what works than what is ideologically desirable. Attempts to build earthly utopias have usually led to hell on earth by way of the concentration camp and the pogrom.</p>
<p>By contrast, pursuing policies that some may disagree with but nobody finds utterly objectionable means that everyone wins - a little tax relief here, a small increase in the minimum wage there.</p>
<p>If proposition wants change on a massive scale, it raises the question of &lsquo;toward what end&rsquo;? The gradualist approach has delivered remarkably stable economies and societies throughout the West and standards of living, health and education that would have been undreamed of a century ago. What exactly, would be the benefits of doing things differently?</p>
