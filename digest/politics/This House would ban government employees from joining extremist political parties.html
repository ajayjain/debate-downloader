    <h1 class="print-title">This House would ban government employees from joining extremist political parties</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>All liberal democratic states are reliant on employing large numbers of their citizens in order to execute the policies formulated by their legislative and executive branches. Many public sector organisations, such as police forces and the prison services, operate as extensions of the executive, using the executive’s right to deploy power and coercion to enforce the state’s laws. Other public sector organisations fulfil vital social needs, by providing healthcare and education to citizens. A dedicated bureaucratic and technocratic service, usually called a civil service, may be employed to provide independent advice and administrative support to elected leaders.</p><p>Although the leaders and senior staff of liberal democracies are elected on a politically partisan basis, as a general principle public sector organisations do not pursue their own political agendas. Public sector organisations exist to carry out the instructions of elected political leaders.</p><p>Individuals employed by the various branches of liberal democratic states are allowed to retain their political autonomy and their rights as citizens. Concepts such as rule-of-law ensure that all the occupants of a state, whether part of the government or not, are accorded equal protection under the law. Even so, some limits may be placed on government employee’s freedom to criticise the state. Impartial civil services, such as the Crown’s civil service in the UK, may require their staff to refrain from participating in public and high profile political campaigning. Alternately some executive branches may employ their own, partisan administrative staff.</p><p>Individuals employed by liberal states remain free to hold beliefs and expression opinions that dissent from the political ideology of the states’ elected governments. They are also free- thanks to the democratic norm of free speech- to express opinions that dissent from the liberal democratic paradigm.</p><p>In 2008 the membership list of the British National Party, an extreme right wing organisation active in UK politics, was leaked onto the internet. The list included the names, addresses and occupations of twelve thousand individuals. UK police forces immediately began to review the list to determine whether any of their officers had joined the party<a href="/print/17766#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>. Despite having campaigned against supranational enforcement of basic human rights, the BNP claimed that its members’ rights to privacy and free speech would be violated if they were removed from their jobs by reason of their political beliefs. A number of active and retired teachers, doctors, council clerks and social workers were also found to be BNP members.</p><p>Public debate following the leak quickly became focussed on whether governments have a right to vet the political beliefs and associations of their employees.</p><p>Screening of employees political beliefs seems especially pertinent in states where free speech laws allow citizens to freely associate with political groups opposed to the protection of free speech and other core constitutional principles.</p><p>Restrictions on the political activities of state employees vary from country to country. Rules restricting state employee’s political activities in the UK are relatively unobtrusive. In 2004 the Association of Chief Police Officers agreed that all UK police forces would dismiss officers revealed to be members of the BNP. The ACPO’s decision explicitly referenced the police services’ obligation, under the Race Relations Amendment Act 2000, to promote peaceful, equitable and equal relations between different racial groups. In 2009 the established Church of England voted to ban its clergy from joining the BNP.</p><p>Regulation of state employee’s political involvement varies throughout the USA. A recent, prominent case concerned a Nebraskan police officer who was discovered to have joined the Knights Party, a racist organisation closely aligned with the white supremacist Klu Klux Klan<a href="/print/17766#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>. The officer was removed from his position. In 2006 an arbitration court overturned the decision of the officer’s superiors and reinstated him. Following a sequence of appeals the case reached Nebraska’s state supreme court. Commenting on the trooper’s position, constitutional lawyer Derek Shaffer stated that “There is first amendment jurisprudence that entitles public employees to certain rights of speech and association. First [a court will] ask whether the employee’s speech is speech on a matter of public concern… If that [is] the case, then the second step is to balance the employee’s speech interest against the employer’s interest in regulating the workplace.”<a href="/print/17766#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a></p><p>The proposition side definition of an extremist political party is likely to vary from debate to debate, but competent speakers should aim to define heterodox political thought in relation to accepted western liberal democratic norms. Political movements that advocate the abolition of racial equality laws serve as one example of extremism. However, it may also be productive to discuss left and liberal extremists. A student Trotskyist who advocates the creation of a communist state by armed insurrection is also an extremist. Such an individual holds views that are in radical opposition to both liberal norms and to the democratic structures that allow him to express those views.</p><p>Extremist political movements may also be identified by their intransigent or inflexible adherence to political controversial ideologies. This definition can be useful when discussing the political counterparts of extreme religious groups or ethnic identity groups.</p><p>Certain provinces and states in Canada and Australia protect public employees from being discriminated against on the grounds of their political beliefs. Similar rules apply in New Zealand and in Northern Ireland.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> “Police scour BNP membership to find officers breaching ban.” The Guardian, 19 November 2008. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/nov/19/police-bnp-far-right-list">http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/nov/19/police-bnp-far-right-list</a></p></div><div id="edn2"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[ii]</a> “Court upholds firing of trooper with Klan ties.” MSNBC. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29432935/ns/us_news-life/t/court-upholds-firing-trooper-klan-ties/#.TsUXKsMr27s">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29432935/ns/us_news-life/t/court-upholds-firing-trooper-klan-ties/#.TsUXKsMr27s</a></p></div><div id="edn3"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title="">[iii]</a> “State Trooper, fired for associating with KKK, argues for job back.” Wall Street Journal Law Blog, 06 March 2008. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/03/06/state-trooper-fired-for-associating-with-kkk-argues-for-job-back/">http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/03/06/state-trooper-fired-for-associating-with-kkk-argues-for-job-back/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-editors">

                    <p>Government employees are, ultimately, duty bound to uphold the policies and principles implemented by the executive branch. The executive is limited in its range of action – it is necessary to delegate certain of its duties to bodies such as the police, the military and the education services.</p><p>As representatives of the government, employees whom obstruct or attempt to subvert the laws that it implements are effectively obstructing the liberal autonomy of the fellow citizens. The executive is elected and empowered on the basis that it will bring about certain changes to law and society that have been mandated by the electorate. The executive is also given the authority to act to fulfil broader, more aspiration goals that echo the desires and objectives of society as a whole. At every stage in its life cycle, a state remains democratically accountable. Politicians undertake to set personal ambition aside and to act as representatives of the popular will – their own values and political beliefs take second place to the beliefs articulated by the electorate. A government would be completely ineffective, and would rapidly loose the confidence of the electorate if it enacted policies according to the personal preference of its members. Similarly, the groups and individuals to whom the government’s power is delegated can also undermine its mandate if they also refuse to impartially implemented democratically sanctioned laws and policies.</p><p>A government employee who decides to pursue his own political agenda in the course of doing his job fails in his duty to impartially implement the laws and policies constructed by the executive. Thus, members of racist or extremist political movements should not be employed by the government, as there is a risk that they will prioritise their own beliefs and political objectives over those of the electorate. Not only do governments have a duty to ensure that they pursue egalitarian and equitable employment policies, they also have a much more important duty to ensure that the machinery of the state is effective and efficient. Without appropriate vetting, this duty cannot be fulfilled. Notable failures under the status quo include the discovery that a number of workers employed by the UK tax authorities to oversee support payments to poor minority families had been deliberately reducing the amounts of money families received<a href="/print/17766#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>.</p><p>Indeed, extremists are more likely to ignore their duty to act impartially because of the heterodox nature of their beliefs. The term “extremism” implies a willingness to depart from moderate and open discourse, and to set aside social convention in the pursuit of political beliefs.<a href="/print/17766#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> Many political parties such as the BNP portray themselves as victims of repression by a liberal elite, while at the same time remaining cognitively blind to the fact that liberal forms of political discourse are the basis of their organisation’s existence.</p><p>Under these circumstances, individuals whose view of the world has been systemically distorted by their beliefs are more likely to use positions of power to correct the “imbalances” that they perceive in society<a href="/print/17766#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a>.</p><p>Political parties also function as peer networks. Membership of a party gives individuals a certain sense of belonging and allows them to influence and define the identity of other members. Members of extremist parties who do not want to use their position to promote extreme views are likely to come under pressure from other party members to do so. Even if a member of an extremist party vows that he will not abuse his role as a teacher or a civil servant, others who share his beliefs will try to convince him to do so.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> “HMRC staff sacked over race abuse.” BBC News Online, 18 August 2010. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-11011034">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-11011034</a></p></div><div id="edn2"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[ii]</a> The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, ‘extremist’, <em>thefreedictionary.com</em>, 2009, <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/extremism">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/extremism</a></p></div><div id="edn3"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title="">[iii]</a> “BNP deputy leader work from London City Hall office.” The Telegraph, 20 Nov 2008. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3488087/BNP-Deputy-Leader-works-from-London-City-Hall-office.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3488087/BNP-Deputy-Leader-works-from-London-City-Hall-office.html</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Working for a state is no different to any other job. Indeed, social services that may be provided by the state in one western liberal democracy will be provided by private or third sector businesses in another. A significant proportion of the American healthcare industries are either privatised or partially subsidised.</p><p>There is little functional difference between buying insurance or a loan from a branch of a consumer bank and applying for income support or a voting card. All of these processes are now largely automated, with the decision making and means assessment aspects of such services carried out by computer programmes. It is remarkably difficult for an individual employee to bias these processes against particular claimants. At any rate, multiple civil servants are employed in assessing claims – the influence that any one individual can have over an application for state support will be extremely limited.</p><p>All western liberal governments are founded on the idea that individual action and an individual’s inherent, unconscious biases may subvert the wider objectives and aspirations collectively voiced by a state’s populace. As a result, liberal governments are dense with checks and balances to prevent such abuses of power taking place.</p><p>It seems disingenuous to expect that the state, as the guarantor of political freedom, should only recruit employees who conform to an artificially limited range of political viewpoints.</p><p>Even if there is a measure of diversity within the civil service, education service or police service envisioned by the proposition, the various viewpoints of these organisations’ employees will be set in orbit around an agreed set of limitations and taboos. In other words, there will be areas in which members of these organisations will reach almost unanimous agreement.</p><p>It is dangerous to encourage the emergence of such a culture. The best advocate for the value and relevance of particular political viewpoints is someone who professes an ideological attachment to those views. If such individuals are removed from the organisations expressly created to protect democratic diversity and freedom, there is a risk that their views will be excluded from the sphere of protection offered by democratic norms. Whether intentionally, or as a result of group think and more subtle biases, those with radical or heterodox views could be excluded from democratic discourse, for want of advocates or allies within the state.</p><p>Impartial systems of rules, roles and normative objectives protect democracy and ensure that services are provided without bias, compromise or favouritism. The resolution threatens to undermine the role the democratic institutions play in preventing conflict within politically plural societies and ensuring that politically plural societies remain viable and vital.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Allowing teachers and youth leaders to be members of extremist political groups presents a significant risk to children and young adults. There is, of course, an unsubtle point to be made about the possibility that teachers with extremist views may attempt to indoctrinate their charges.</p><p>Teachers hold positions of respect and authority within educational institutions. They are trusted uncritically; they are tasked with providing children with the cognitive tools that they will use to evaluate the beliefs and controversies they will encounter throughout their lives. Teachers can be a source of inspiration and can foster aspiration.</p><p>A teacher may attempt to imbue pupils with views that run contrary the liberal democratic notion that all individuals, ab initio, are protected by identical sets of rights. They may attempt to present views that run contrary established norms of reasoned engagement and discussion as rational and virtuous<a href="/print/17766#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>. Potentially even more dangerous than attempts to convince a child that a particular racial minority is in some way inferior are attempts to convince him or her that a particular view should not be heard, or that certain freedoms should not be exercised.</p><p>Teachers can also exercise less direct forms of control over children in their care. They may discriminate against their pupils on the basis of prejudices that they already possess. Commentary on the issue<a href="/print/17766#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> by UK teachers’ union the NAS/ UWT<a href="/print/17766#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a> has highlighted the possibility that teachers may indirectly sponsor racist bullying of minority students, by ignoring it or by failing to punish bullies. Teachers may manipulate the grades of certain pupils, attacking their confidence and undermining their academic achievements. They may favour other pupils, giving them a disproportionate amount of attention or praise.</p><p>Teachers may also engage in racial motivated bullying among their peers, disrupting the confidence and authority of their colleagues.</p><p>Attacks and bias of this type often prove hard to detect, as many racial minorities contain disproportionately large numbers of vulnerable families and children. Whether put at risk by economic and cultural marginalisation or by the legal and political quagmire surrounding the status of non EU migrants, the children of minority groups are often confronted with wide ranging and institutionalised prejudice outside of the classroom environment. It is not acceptable to expose them to the danger of racial discrimination by their teachers.</p><p>Moreover, many schools in inner city areas and areas that are home to significant immigrant populations are forced to confront interracial tensions and prejudice on a daily basis. As the general secretary of the NAS/ UWT observed in 2009<a href="/print/17766#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a>, schools’ attempts to promote racial harmony and an environment of tolerant cultural plurality can be undermined simply by knowledge that the education system employs individuals who harbour views directly contrary to these objectives.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> “BNP lecturer behind Muslim heroin leaflet cleared of inciting religious hatred.” The Telegraph, 22 June 2010. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/7844429/BNP-lecturer-behind-Muslim-heroin-leaflet-cleared-of-inciting-religious-hatred.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/7844429/BNP-lecturer-behind-Muslim-heroin-leaflet-cleared-of-inciting-religious-hatred.html</a></p></div><div id="edn2"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[ii]</a> “Why I wouldn’t ban BNP members from being teachers.” The Guardian, 28 June 2009. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jun/28/nick-cohen-bnp-criminal-offence">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jun/28/nick-cohen-bnp-criminal-offence</a></p></div><div id="edn3"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title="">[iii]</a> “Expel the BNP from schools.” The Guardian, 20 June 2009. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jun/20/bnp-schools-nasuwt-far-right">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jun/20/bnp-schools-nasuwt-far-right</a></p></div><div id="edn4"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref4" name="_edn4" title="">[iv]</a> “Expel the BNP from schools.” The Guardian, 20 June 2009. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jun/20/bnp-schools-nasuwt-far-right">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jun/20/bnp-schools-nasuwt-far-right</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Under the status quo, teachers in most western liberal democracies are already obliged to conceal their political beliefs from their students. This convention also frequently applies to higher education institutions in many states. Thus, it is already possible to discipline or dismiss teachers who engage in overtly political activities within the classroom.</p><p>Many highly educated professionals- and especially pedagogues- hold political views that diverge from the mainstream. This does not mean that they are likely to attempt to radicalise the individuals they are made responsible for. Indeed, most political non conformists recognise that attempting to target impressionable and naive individuals is counterproductive. A political cause can be easily undermined by an accusation that it is only able to recruit new members by directly appealing to the politically ignorant and the unusually credulous. Extremists are more likely to seek out open platforms or sympathetic individuals who have independently arrived at similar political views.</p><p>Most liberal democratic states allow teachers and civil servants to belong to political parties, provided they do not attempt to articulate those beliefs<a href="/print/17766#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>. Political non conformists have freedom of conscience, if not the freedom to speak their minds whenever they choose. If individual’s views are so extreme that they feel compelled to express them, then state employers can take action against them. However, implementing the resolution in any meaningful way will require side proposition to allow the state to rifle through the correspondence and the private lives of its citizens to screen them for concealed extremist sympathies. It would also mean requiring political parties to expose their membership lists to state authorities, increasing the risk that individuals who are not publicly employed might have their allegiances exposed to the public.</p><p>Moreover, side proposition limit their comments to the theoretical dangers posed by allowing individuals with right wing and racist beliefs to work in the public sector. They do not comment on the dangers of placing those with far left view onto the public payroll.

                    <p>It is often unclear whether extremist political organisations are likely to become violent or to engage in provocative acts of hate speech. Although the state does not have a right to obstruct or prevent such organisations from meeting or protesting, it does have a right to control the manner and circumstances in which such meetings take place. Doing so ensures that citizens who do not want to be involved in, or whose activities and freedoms might be materially affected by the articulation of extremist views can go about their business without hindrance. Part of the state’s role is to balance these sets of incommensurate rights. All western liberal democracies use their police forces to enforce this balance.</p><p>It is possible that a conflict of interest could arise between the political views of a police officer or a state solicitor responsible for overseeing the circumstances in which a rally or gathering will take place and the balancing role of the state. A police officer with links to an extremist party may, conceivably, be made responsible for policing the conduct of friends and political allies.</p><p>If such a situation was to arise, the capability of the officer to make appropriately impartial, value neutral decisions about the types of activity that would be permitted at such a demonstration might be compromised. Even if the officer expressly adopts a neutral stance, personal ideological bias may still lead him to perceive a demonstration by his friends and allies as inherently less threatening or in need of oversight than a protest mounted by another organisation. Not only will this undermine the police’s ability to supervise and regulate individual’s democratic rights, it will also have an impact on the perspective that ordinary people adopt in relation to the state. Marginalised citizens may be less willing to approach police officer’s for help if they are aware that their bias’s go unchallenged. One of the causes of the marginalisation of minority groups is bias in service provision among civilian service providers – suspicion of similar bias amongst the police may create a culture of distrust among many minority groups.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>State employees- including members of the security and police services- encounter conflicts of interest throughout their working lives. A police officer may become involved in a case in which a member of his or her family is suspect. A civil servant or local council worker may be required to determine whether friends, family or a partner should receive a state funded subsidy.</p><p>The impartiality of state servants may be called into question in circumstances where their own background, whether personal or professional, may appear to undermine their ability to impartially implement the decisions and policies of the executive.</p><p>Structured, accountable and responsive civil service organisations recognise that such occurrences are routine and inevitable. Consequently, all western liberal democratic states incorporate a degree of flexibility into official bodies that wield delegated powers. The size of organisations such as the police means that conflicts of interest will continually threaten their impartiality, but employees of these organisations are made aware that their roles and duties may be restructured in order to avoid such conflicts.</p><p>Police officers can be deployed to duties that will not bring them into contacts with families members or friends. Moreover, internal procedures in most public sector organisations punish attempts to conceal possible conflicts of interest, but go to pains to point out that the fact of the conflict’s existence will not prejudice an employee’s chances or promotion or make their position less secure.</p><p>Judges are educated and trained to recognise even more remote and tenuous forms of personal bias than a familial link to the defendant or claimant in a particular case.

                    <p>Quite simply, it is wrong for the state to intrude into the private sphere of its citizens’ lives. Privacy- and the accompanying understanding that the state can only intrude on it in the most dire of circumstances- serves an important function in allowing people to engage in non-conformist and controversial activity, without encroaching on the lives and freedoms of others.</p><p>The state may intrude on an individual’s private life if the safety of another individual is at stake – as in cases of domestic abuse, organised crime or terrorism. However, the state is generally prevented from surveilling individuals with controversial beliefs and those they associate with. Free speech, even hate speech, articulated behind closed doors and to a small audience is unlikely to provoke riots or to intimidate third parties.</p><p>The principle can be surmised in even plainer terms. The state does not have a right to restrict an individual’s freedom on the basis of their privately held beliefs. The state can only take action against individuals if it has evidence that an individual has or is likely to, carry out harmful actions on the basis of those beliefs. By imposing a blanket ban on membership of extreme political movements, the state is characterising all such movements as being innately predisposed to violence and subversion.</p><p>Privacy serves to allow people a limited amount of freedom to express radical opinions, partly in recognition of the fact that even the most contemptible dissenting views can have a value. Further, privacy also ensures that free expression is not undermined by populist political pressure; it ensures that citizens will always be able to articulate ideas without being obliged to make concessions to majority opinion, and without finding their freedom of expression obstructed by popular disgust.</p><p>If the views of a group or a political party are so extreme that there is a risk that its members will promote political violence or social exclusion, then there may instead be a case for banning it entirely under laws that prevent incitement- for example- to racial hatred.</p><p>Over time, prohibited views may come to include those of any political groups that the state perceives as a threat to its objectives and mandate. Different governments are politically aligned in different ways. Not all administrations may have a coherent view on what does and does not constitute an extreme political belief. Factions within the UK labour party are still sympathetic towards certain “extreme” interpretations of socialism, which attempt to promote greater state control over industry and employment. Within the labour party itself- and within a future labour government- these views might be seen as only outdate or radical. A conservative government would think differently. Similarly, the Conservative party affiliated interest group The Monday Club still commands significant interest within the Conservative party itself, but has been criticised by left wing politicians for promoting “racist” perspectives on immigration and international development.</p><p>All laws can be expanded and manipulated. Side proposition cannot rely on using closed lists to determine which extreme organisations should be kept away from the public sector and which should not. Different perspectives on extremism will make the operation of the ban politically contentious; with sufficient support however, a government could expand a list of prohibited organisations to include moderate or avowedly non-violent political groups.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The opposition side’s assertion that the definition of an extremist political party will be distorted by a government’s own inherent political biases is inaccurate. When western liberal states are called on to assess the harms posed by particular political groups- or by particular individuals- they are obliged to defer to safeguarding mechanisms that eliminate latent political bias. For instance, when a political organisation is designated as a terrorist organisation under the UK’s Terrorism Act 2000<a href="/print/17766#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>, the act allows for members of that organisation to appeal for it to be de-proscribed, first by approaching the home office, or by appealing to the judiciary if necessary.</p><p>The lists of illegal and proscribed organisations that liberal democratic states operate are closed lists. Organisations must be specifically identified before they can be banned - organisations are not proscribed according to their conformity to a certain set of criteria. The processes that allow for an organisation to be added to a closed list are usually lengthy and require either judicial oversight or legislative debate. It is clear that this constitutes a substantial and robust safeguard against the misuse of governmental powers.</p><p>Put more simply, concepts like separation of powers and political independence are an acknowledgement that the most powerful governmental actors within a western liberal democracy are also political actors.</p><p>Checks and balances of the type discussed above are designed to ensure that only objectively dangerous organisations are subjected to surveillance and control by the state.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> Terrorism Act 2000, Part II, S3-6. <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/contents">http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/contents</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is wrong to deny people the opportunity of employment simply because the government find their views distasteful or “extreme”. It is also dangerous to give the state the power to define the forms of political belief that justify excluding an individual from a particular career.</p><p>It seems disingenuous for side proposition to deny citizens the right to gainful employment while allowing them to retain their right to vote and engage in free speech. It must be pointed out that the undermining of the right to seek employment that accords with an individual’s skills and expertise obstructs the exercise of these other rights. An impoverished individual will be less able and less inclined to engage in political activities or to spend the time necessary to acquire enough information to make an informed voting decision. Side proposition may protest that teachers and civil servants are free to seek work in the private sector if they are removed from their public sector roles. However, in most western liberal democracies, the state has an effective monopoly over teaching and many civil service roles (especially those in intelligence) have no private sector equivalent.</p><p>The mechanism required by the resolution may disincentivise people from seeking employment with the state altogether. Personal political identity is complex, and many people harbour and articulate certain extreme views, even if they do not subscribe to uniformly extreme ideologies. There is a real risk that otherwise public spirited and talented individuals will shy away from public employment, due to concerns that controversial statements that they have made in the past may be used to expel them from their new position.</p><p>It is incorrect to assume that membership of a particular political party will make individuals more likely to voice extreme opinions in the workplace or use public power to advance an extremist agenda. Rational, intelligent individuals are likely to have a greater interest in being seen to do their jobs effectively and efficiently than they are in continually promoting divisive political conflict amongst their colleagues. Serious political activists understand that agitprop must be targeted at the groups and individuals it is most likely to win over.</p><p>Self-interest is an important driving factor in political behaviour and discourse. Under the status quo indiscriminate political proselytising in the workplace is likely to affect an individual’s chances of promotion and the security of his position – not because of the content of his statements, but because they indicate that he is not doing his job. Determined political subversives are already likely to be driven out of the workplace when they become unproductive. Therefore, there is no need to abrogate the freedom of workers who are able to keep their opinions to themselves.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Government employees, such as teachers and prison guards, have special power and privileges that put them in contact with some of the most vulnerable members of society. As a result, they must be held to a higher standard of behaviour than private sector employees.</p><p>Both school children and criminals are vulnerable insofar as discriminatory action- of even the most inconsequential kind- directed against them could have a significant impact on their personal development or wellbeing. Children are at a greater risk of internalising or accepting prejudicial view points, due to their relative naiveté and trusting nature. Criminals may already have experienced significant prejudice and brutality in the environments that they grew up in. Further prejudicial treatment might serve to reinforce a world view based on the idea that the criminal has been forcibly excluded from society, and will only be able to survive and provide for himself by using force and deception.</p><p>The harms that result from requiring an individual to give up extremist beliefs or to leave an extremist organisation before seeking employment with the state are not nearly so great. They remain free to seek employment outside the public sector; they remain free to belong to extremist groups and to express extremist reviews. More importantly, the ability of the individual to pursue his own understanding of “a good life” and to live freely and prosperously within society is not undermined. The same cannot be said of a child, or a convict exposed to the disproportionately damaging effects of hate speech.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Individual’s opinions and actions may be dramatically influenced and motivated by beliefs that are not rooted in political ideologies. Religious, moral and even eco-ethical beliefs are all capable of inspiring government employees to act against the interests of the state and the users of its services. Side opposition acknowledges that the power conferred on state employees can by abused – but it can be abused as easily by a religious zealot or an embittered misogynist as it can by a political extremist. The actions of public sector organisations are regulated by systems of checks and balances for this very reason.</p><p>The risk posed to the efficiency and impartiality of the state by the biases of those entrusted with its powers has long been a concern of democratic reformers and lawmakers.</p><p>Prison guards and police officers undergo vigorous training before being deployed or permitted to use force in the course of their duties. Agents of the state must always provide a justification for the use of force against suspects or prison inmates. Even the use of physical restrain is punished if it appears to have been exercised arbitrarily or outside guidelines set by senior officers.</p><p>Democratic safeguards against the abuse of executive power offer protection against governments that are in danger of becoming tyrannical or oppressive. They also help to ensure that the authority of legitimate governments is not usurped by unelected officials or employees with their own agendas. In point of fact, such safe guards are used far more frequently to remove threats posed to the overarching structures of the state by ill-disciplined employees than they are to counter the less common, generational threat of political tyranny and executive corruption.</p><p>Finally, it should be pointed out that extremist groups with violent agendas will often do everything they can to distance themselves from the state. A truly dangerous extremist group is unlikely to accept state employees into its ranks, for fear that they might bring unwelcome scrutiny. In addition, such groups have shown themselves more than capable of initiating violence without first usurping the resources of the state.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Side opposition note that agents of the state who are permitted to use force in the course of their duties- the police, prison officers, the army- are subjected to rigorous training and are compelled to justify their actions when they decide to use their powers. This observation ignores the fact that the most common abuses of police power do not arise from a biased or arbitrary use of force. The authority of the police is most frequently subverted when officers omit to take action, or ignore pleas for help. Similar incidents- of wilful blindness to the distress of a vulnerable individual or group- have been recorded in the prison service and amongst civil service employees.</p><p>An example serves to illustrate this point. The Macpherson Inquiry<a href="/print/17766#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>, an examination of the political and professional culture of the London metropolitan police force following the bungled investigation of the racially motivated murder of a young black teenager concluded that London’s police service was “institutionally racist”. Although the inquiry determined that overt racism amongst London police officers was minimal, it found that the structure of the institution itself, the training methods it used, the attitudes and assumptions it tolerated and the processes and it followed combined to undermine the quality of service it provided to members of racial minorities. The report found that damaging and distorted approaches to the policing of minority communities had been left unchallenged by the metropolitan police hierarchy. These practices had undermined stability and social order in many areas of inner city London, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that justified ever more invasive and discriminatory<a href="/print/17766#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> police action.</p><p>Members of extremist political movements may refrain from challenging entrenched assumptions of this type. They may even attempt to promote them. As omissions to act, or deliberately incompetent action, is usually harder to detect than out-and-out aggression or proselytising, extremists may be able to use the anonymity and uniformity of large public organisations to conceal their actions.</p><p>Extremist political parties have adapted their tactics in order to circumvent laws and regulations that prohibit attempts to articulate hatred and exclusion in an explicit and public fashion.</p><p>More importantly, throwaway comments and subtle suggestions made by an individual who is confidently and unapologetically aligned to an extremist party may serve to alter or distort the political culture within the department or body he is employed by. A racist or an anti-capitalist will not “convert” others to their heterodox perspective, but will legitimatise and reinforce his colleagues’ low-level biases.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17766#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> Macpherson, et al.
