    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes that film stars, music stars and other popular entertainers should not be participating in party-political campaigns</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Throughout the world, celebrities from the entertainment world have been getting involved with political campaigns. Some, like Reagan and Schwarzenegger in the US, crossed the divide and stood for (and gained) positions of political power, whilst others have been involved in the endorsement of candidates.</p>
<p>This debate is about that latter scenario: what happens when a political candidate is endorsed by celebrities, and should celebrities be allowed to lend their support in that way? (It is also important to note that, the debate below is not about prohibiting celebrities from conducting their own campaigns, e.g. Bono&rsquo;s &lsquo;Make Poverty History&rsquo;.)</p>
<p><strong>Key example:</strong></p>
<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s 2008 presidential campaign was littered with celebrity endorsement. His most notable supporter was Oprah Winfrey, who joined him on the campaign trail. Garthwaite and Moore<a href="/print/36508#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> estimate her endorsement to have been worth just over 1 million votes for Obama. Obama also shared platforms with Leonardo di Caprio and Bruce Springsteen, amongst others<a href="/print/36508#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Further, Obama gained support from musician will.i.am, who produced a video (Yes We Can). This is believed<a href="/print/36508#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> to have helped the formation of a grassroots campaign in support of Obama, who consequently reaped the benefits of an increased voter turnout amongst hard-to-reach voters (primarily young and/or black voters).</p>

                    <p>Celebrity involvement in the political process may increase the extent to which politicians need to court media attention in order to promote their policies.</p>
<p>Many people get their political information from &lsquo;soft-news&rsquo; outlets<a href="/print/36508#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, i.e. entertainment channels and magazines that often focus on &lsquo;celebrity gossip&rsquo;. Shows such as <em>Oprah Winfrey</em> get millions of viewers many of whom don&rsquo;t get news through other mediums and although soft news is the preferred format for a minority (10.2%) for a great many more it is in their top three.<a href="/print/36508#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The involvement of celebrities in the political sphere increases the power of &ldquo;soft-news&rdquo; over the political process: due to the wide reach of &ldquo;soft-news&rdquo; it is not possible to counter its effects using narrow-reach opinion pieces and policy analysis. Rather, politicians are forced either to package their ideas in a way acceptable to these magazines and talk shows (i.e. reduce the analysis; &lsquo;dumb down&rsquo;), for example Obama in 2009 became the first sitting president to appear on a late night comedy show; <em>Tonight Show with Jay Leno</em>,<a href="/print/36508#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> or to counter attack by seeking celebrity endorsement of their own.</p>
<p>This makes political debate increasingly shallow, and voters&rsquo; decisions correspondingly less well-informed. The harmful impacts upon our democratic process are two-fold: first, voters being less informed means they are less likely to truly be voting in a way that is aligned with their best interests or political beliefs; second, the debate is skewed towards ideas that can be conveyed in short &lsquo;sound-bites&rsquo; and away from ideas that require more complicated discussion.</p>

                    <p>The accusation of &lsquo;dumbing down&rsquo; is misguided: politicians will increasingly be able to reach a wider voter base if they are willing to repackage their ideas and policies, but this does not require &lsquo;dumbing down&rsquo;, simply a change in focus of the explanation. So not only is dumbing down not necessary, but politicians&rsquo; ideas are reaching more voters!</p>
<p>For example, the &lsquo;war on women,&rsquo; has gained considerable attention in the media, and this has given a platform for female celebrities like Eva Longoria, to participate in events like the Democratic National Convention<a href="/print/36508#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Eva Longoria and politicians who feel that women are being unfair attacked in regards to their body are now having these issues highlighted. Having celebrities involved in political campaigns like Eva Longoria does not mean the campaign was &lsquo;dumbed down&rsquo; it means that it was accessible to a larger audience because they understood what she was talking about.&nbsp; Surely, that cannot be a bad thing.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that those who consume this soft news will be much better informed and be consistent in voting than those who consume no news at all.<a href="/print/36508#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> As a result they will be more likely to vote and soft news will give them some awareness of why they are voting even if a celebrity endorsement has some baring on that vote.</p>

                    <p>Politicians want endorsements because they know it will bring votes; it is estimated that Oprah&rsquo;s endorsement of Obama in the Democratic Primary of 2008 brought an additional 1 million votes to Obama.<a href="/print/36508#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It is unjust for celebs to use their influence in this way. Celebrities have an ability to influence the political sphere that bears no necessary relationship with their knowledge of the subjects concerned, or qualifications otherwise to do so.</p>
<p>Consequently, they represent an unelected, unaccountable pressure on the democratic system: they have been given power and influence, with no mechanism of checking that power, or way to prevent them from misleading the public (unlike, for example, political journalists, news channels and other sources of political information).</p>
<p>This is principally unjust: the optimum democratic system is the one that holds the closest to the principle of &ldquo;one person, one vote&rdquo;, and attempts to ensure that those votes are as informed as possible. Celebrity involvement in politics is a hindrance to that, effectively handing the famous more votes than is their due.</p>

                    <p>This &lsquo;injustice&rsquo; needs to be weighed against the effects of the policy. If you prohibit celebrities from participating in party-political campaigns, commit an injustice against the celebrities.</p>
<p>You violate the right to self-expression of the celebrity. Everyone in a free society has the right to express their political views; indeed, this is something we hold to be a hallmark of such freedom. Celebrities should be no different, and should hold those same rights. Further, they cannot be said to have consented into such a loss of rights (given that not all chose the level of fame and power they find themselves with).</p>
<p>Further, it is a bit melodramatic to suggest that people with influence &lsquo;effectively have more votes&rsquo;. By this metric, we would have to also prohibit the persuasive from participating in political campaigns. People have differences in their abilities to persuade others to follow their lead, and this is something that we simply have to take measures to ensure does not disproportionately impact upon any given party.</p>

                    <p>Celebrity endorsement distracts those who normally provide information to voters. Newspapers, blogs and other online media all have limited space, and, because celebrities sell, will use that space showing who is supporting whom, rather than covering debate about a politician’s policies and ideas.</p>
<p>Though the presence of celebrities may actually give the masses more avenue to relate to electoral processes, the fact still stands that in status quo people are more interested in the activities of their favorite celebrities which will thus blot out the candidates themselves. When voters see celebrity endorsements they are no longer thinking about how these future politicians can make an impact on their lives. In some cases the celebrity may help show the platform of policies the candidate is standing on but most of the time they are simply taking airtime from more in depth analysis. What is worse when wooing celebrities becomes important for politicians the politicians themselves have less time to formulate and articulate their policies.</p>
<p>This is detrimental to the democratic process. People having less information than they would otherwise impairs their ability to make an informed choice about how they would like to vote. A prohibition on celebrity interference in political debate would remove this obscuring effect.</p>
<p>All of the above adds to the depoliticisation of politics. If the celebrity endorsement continues to thrive, younger generations will disengage with the important political issues at hand. Instead of learning about the fundamental issues surrounding their country, they will be exposed to party tactics that are of no use to their political development.</p>

                    <p>This is not necessarily the case: there remains a diverse assortment of news sources, and with the explosion in size and quality of the blogosphere, people are increasingly accessing information from a wide range of sources. Thus it is decreasingly the case that space in the news can be conceived of as limited in this way.</p>
<p>Further, providers of political analysis might find it easier to sell papers/shows to a wider audience when they can use a celebrity image or quote as well, resulting in a more, not less, informed population.</p>

                    <p>Celebrity endorsement of a candidate does more than make people vote, drone-like, for the candidate endorsed by their favourite celebrity. Rather, it encourages people who might not otherwise have thought politics was interesting to pay attention to it. Especially in an age of easily accessible information, people can easily access sufficient information about political personalities and policies to cast a meaningful vote.</p>
<p>As a consequence, you have more potential voters, from a wider cross-section of society, note the key role played by personalities like will.i.am in engaging young people during the Obama campaign. Rock the Vote with a large amount of celebrity support registered 2.6million voters in 2008 and it and other celebrity campaigns had been prominent in 2004 as well which was probably a key factor in 2million more 18-29 year olds voting in 2008 compared to 2004 or 6.5million over 2000.<a href="/print/36508#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>Some of the people thus enthused may go on further with their interest in the political system, some may simply start listening to news shows or reading blogs that they would otherwise have shunned. Either way, celebrity involvement has a beneficial impact on our political system that it would be foolish to discard: the larger and more diverse the voter base, the more politicians are held to account and the more likely we are to reach the best political outcomes.</p>

                    <p>There is no particular reason why someone who is interested in a particular politician-endorsing celebrity would choose to do political research. Given, in particular, the segregation of news, where magazines and blogs tend to specialise (on, say, politics or celebrity life) it is hard to see why crossover would occur.</p>
<p>The internet, whilst it makes information more accessible, accentuates this problem: where you can skip from news item to news item so easily, you are less likely to read an in-depth piece of political analysis by your favourite celebrity if you are not, in the first place, interested in politics.</p>
<p>Further, it is worth considering a balance of harms here: on the one hand you have a smaller, but better informed voter base (those interested in politics without celebrities), and on the other hand a larger but less well-informed voter base (assuming not all the people who see a celebrity endorsement and go on to vote do any research first). That former scenario, without the uninformed voters, is the most likely to lead to the best political outcome.</p>

                    <p>There exists a problem with regards to advocacy for minority issues within mainstream political movements. This motion would exacerbate that problem.</p>
<p>Voters tend to base their decisions on key issues (things like education, the state of the economy, healthcare policy etc.). Whilst they may care about more marginal issues (e.g. gay rights, religious freedoms, environmental issues), they are often unwilling to sacrifice something they think has a greater impact on them for something that has a lesser impact.</p>
<p>Minority issues suffer particularly here: by their very nature, there are fewer people who feel directly affected than there are people who feel indirectly affected or indifferent. Consequently, there are never a great enough proportion of votes that could be gained by a political party concentrating on these particular issues in a way which might be detrimental. See, for example, the public reaction in the UK to Cameron&rsquo;s position on gay marriage: whilst most people feel that gay marriage should be allowed<a href="/print/36508#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, Cameron has not received a political boost as a result of this decision, but rather, has faced hostility from those who believe it is a &ldquo;distraction&rdquo;<a href="/print/36508#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, where they would rather he focused on issues like the economic crisis.</p>

                    <p>This may well be a side-benefit of celebrity involvement in politics, however, the effect celebrities have on the promotion of minority interests is not decreased by their prohibition from party-politics. They can still engage in general advocacy and campaigning on specific issues important to them without endorsing parties or candidates.</p>
<p>The policy-vote relationship that celebrities have with voters works in the opposite direction than for politicians: where politicians must choose the policies they believe will attract voters, celebrities first attract voters and then advocate for particular policies. This adds to the danger of celebrity participation; a celebrity may be endorsing a particular candidate because of that candidate&rsquo;s support on that issue. Fans of the celebrity who may be influenced by the endorsement may have no interest or even be opposed to the issue for which the celebrity is endorsing the candidate. This would make celebrity endorsements as a result of minority issues positively counterproductive.</p>
