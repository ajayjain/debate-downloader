    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes Wikipedia is a force for good</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Wikipedia is a free online encyclopaedia produced entirely by the voluntary efforts of hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world. It was founded in by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001, after an earlier effort to build a traditional “expert” encyclopaedia online got bogged down in the slow complexities of academic review and professional editing. Instead Wikipedia adopted wiki software, which allows groups of people to cooperate dynamically in writing and editing material online. To many people’s surprise, this open-access approach was a rapid success, attracting many high-quality submissions from a wide range of contributors. This was despite (or because of) online warfare between rival volunteers who sought to edit and reedit entries.</p><p>As of May 2011 the English-language Wikipedia site has over 3.6 million articles; adding in entries from versions in other languages raises the total to over 9.25 million. Proponents argue it has rapidly become an indispensable reference for anyone seeking information and is one of the most heavily visited sites on the internet. It has become particularly heavily used by students at school and college, to the concern of some educationalists but the applause of others. Nevertheless, from the start Wikipedia has had its critics, with co-founder Larry Sanger leaving the project early over the direction of the site. Past and present editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica have criticised Wikipedia for inaccuracy, arguing that its democratic ethos lacks academic rigour and provides no guarantee that any entry can be relied upon though a study in the science journal Nature found that the two encyclopaedias have similar levels of error<a href="/print/17890#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a><a>.</a>&nbsp;Others have criticised the agenda of the site, and the way in which its rules for contributors (including the famous “Neutral Point of View,” or NPOV) are applied in practice. Despite a number of well-publicised scandals, however, proponents maintain the site has continued to grow, both in size and in importance.</p><p><a href="/print/17890#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Giles, J.

                    <p>Wikipedia exists to provide free, open and easy access to information and knowledge. Its goal is to ‘distribute a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet in their own language, and to an astonishing degree (it) is succeeding’.<a href="/print/17890#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It already has over 3.5 million articles in English alone.<a href="/print/17890#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This is more than ten times those of Encyclopaedia Britannica, its nearest printed rival. Traditionally, reference works were very expensive, which meant previously that knowledge was restricted to the wealthy, or those with access to well-funded public libraries. Wikipedia liberates that knowledge and provides volumes of online information to anyone with access to a computer, or even a smartphone, and the internet. Its impact is only restrained by the reach of internet providers and the desire of people to learn. Users do not need to be able to afford particular print objects but can access contents of Wikipedia from any location with Internet connectivity.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17890#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/07/31/060731fa_fact">Schiff, S.

                    <p>Wikipedia does not provide free, open access to knowledge, for it only applies to those who already have access to both a computer and internet access. Furthermore, since very few computer retailers or internet service providers are willing to provide their services free of charge, to declare Wikipedia free is disingenuous; there are substantial charges before Wikipedia can be utilized. Moreover while Wikipedia may provide free open access to knowledge this is mostly for those who speak English. Those who need this resource are those who speak much smaller languages but as yet Wikipedia is not a good resource in these languages. The Punjabi Wikipedia only has 3,000 articles<a href="/print/17890#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> despite it being&nbsp; a language with more than sixty million speakers.<a href="/print/17890#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Lastly, whilst Wikipedia has advantages over traditional print encyclopaedias, tangible objects have the advantage of never going offline and therefore being able to provide their information constantly.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17890#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">Wikimedia.

                    <p>The process of collaboration required to create and maintain an up-to-date, factual source of information encourages democratic practices and principles. Wikipedia seeks to achieve its democratic goal of the spread of free, open material by democratic means. As an open-source project it relies upon the collaboration of tens of thousands of people who constantly add, check and edit articles. Disagreements and disputes are sent up the line to moderators, who oversee the editing process. This “socialisation of expertise” as David Weinberger puts it<a href="/print/17890#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> ensures that errors and omissions are rapidly identified and corrected and that the site is constantly and accurately updated. No traditional encyclopaedia can match this scrutiny. Indeed, “Wikipedia has the potential to be the greatest effort in collaborative knowledge gathering the world has ever known, and it may well be the greatest effort in voluntary collaboration of any kind.”<a href="/print/17890#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Not only do such democratic processes encourage democracy more generally, but they are an effective means to create a user-friendly product, as illustrated by open source software such as Firefox and Linux.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17890#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/6794228">The Economist.

                    <p>Collaboration in editing does not encourage democratic principles, but merely privileges the loudest voice, or in this case, the most regular user. As such, creating knowledge by consensus is inherently flawed. A fact is not true simply because lots of people think so. Traditional encyclopaedias are written and edited by academics and professional experts, whose reputation is put on the line by the articles they produce. They have the credentials and expertise that give them the authority to write without requiring widespread communal feedback. However, anyone can write a Wikipedia article, regardless of how much or how little knowledge he or she has of the subject. Worse yet, because contributors are effectively anonymous, it is impossible to assess the quality of an article on an unfamiliar topic by assessing the credentials of those who have produced it. Collaboration, therefore, becomes a barrier to the provision of reliable, accurate and up-to-date information.</p>        </div>

Enquiries will not and should not end at Wikipedia, but it provides accessible background information as well as links to additional research and publication on a topic and is, therefore, an obvious starting point.<a href="/print/17890#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Nobody at Wikipedia has claimed that it is a definitive account of human knowledge or a replacement for in-depth research. But it gives a quick guide to an unknown subject and points the enquirer on to more specialist sources. It is used to good effect by students, teachers, journalists and even judges, among many others – showing it is a valued reference source. Experienced users can quickly assess the quality of an article from its written quality and the thoroughness of its references, so they need not accept its content out of hand. Nothing on the internet should ever be accepted uncritically, but Wikipedia has earned its reputation as a valuable starting resource.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17890#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://writingspaces.org/essays/wikipedia-is-good-for-you">Purdy, J.

                    <p>Wikipedia is a common starting point for enquiries, but not because it is excellent; it has become a standard source of reference because it is free and easy to access. Wikipedia, through its popularity, is often the first search result found when using public search engines like Google, which draws users to its information regardless of the reliability that other sources may offer. Many of its users are students, with too little experience to ascertain the quality of an article but anxious to find the quickest and ostensibly most efficient path to the information they require. Overdependence on Wikipedia means that students in particular never develop proper research skills and increasingly accept that an approximately right answer is good enough.<a href="/print/17890#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a><sup>,<a href="/print/17890#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Middlebury College’s history department even banned students from citing Wikipedia in papers,<a href="/print/17890#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales himself has asserted that changes to Wikipedia are necessary to make it a suitable resource for college students.<a href="/print/17890#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a><sup>,<a href="/print/17890#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17890#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Graham, L., &amp; Metaxas, P.

                    <p>A key principle for Wikipedia is to present information as neutrally as possible. This has led to Wikipedia being banned in China, after Jimmy Wales refused to censor articles to make the site acceptable to the Chinese government.<a href="/print/17890#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Wikipedia, thus, epitomizes the principle that all should have access to the necessary information required not just to live, but also enjoy and cherish our lives. As such, Wikipedia is not threatened by variants and rivals that also seek to promote freedom of knowledge because it views them as partners to a mutual goal, not rivals. Its founder, Jimmy Wales, readily acknowledges it will eventually be superseded by another way of sharing knowledge on a mass level.<a href="/print/17890#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17890#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2006/sep/10/news.china">Revill, D.

                    <p>By providing its articles for “free,” Wikipedia will drive traditional, high-quality encyclopaedias out of business by destroying their business model<a>.</a>&nbsp;Indeed the traditional print version of the Encyclopaedia Britannica has already been discontinued with the focus changing to the online version after sales had declined from 120,000 in 1990 to only 8000 in 2010.<a href="/print/17890#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Wikipedia may make articles available for nothing to those with access to the internet (still only a minority of people in the world), but many of these articles are not worth reading. The cost of a traditional encyclopaedia may be high, but it pays for articles written, checked and edited by experts and professionals. Even on the internet there is no such thing as a free lunch: people have to pay for internet access and computers. If Wikipedia makes it harder for ordinary people to access reliable information, then the world will be a poorer place.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17890#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/after-244-years-encyclopaedia-britannica-stops-the-presses/?ref=todayspaper">Bosman, Julie, (2012, March 13).

                    <p>Wikipedia does offer a better service, not necessarily in terms of the quality of information, but in terms of the depth, breadth and accessibility of information. Enquiries will not and should not end at Wikipedia, but it provides accessible background information as well as links to additional research and publication on a topic and is, therefore, an obvious starting point.<a href="/print/17890#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Nobody at Wikipedia has claimed that it is a definitive account of human knowledge or a replacement for in-depth research. But it gives a quick guide to an unknown subject and points the enquirer on to more specialist sources. It is used to good effect by students, teachers, journalists and even judges, among many others – showing it is a valued reference source. Experienced users can quickly assess the quality of an article from its written quality and the thoroughness of its references, so they need not accept its content out of hand. Nothing on the internet should ever be accepted uncritically, but Wikipedia has earned its reputation as a valuable starting resource.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17890#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://writingspaces.org/essays/wikipedia-is-good-for-you">Purdy, J.

                    <p>One of the major problems with Wikipedia is that it has very patchy coverage. Traditional reference sources provide consistent coverage over the whole field of knowledge, with priority given to the most important topics in terms of space and thoroughness of treatment. By contrast, Wikipedia has very detailed coverage of topics in which its main contributors are interested, but weak material on other, much more important issues.<a href="/print/17890#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Thus, there is, for example, much more on the imaginary language of Klingon than there is on the life and philosophy of John Locke.</p>

                    <p>Wikipedia is a service that offers information where it is felt most necessary. If there is more information on the imaginary language of Klingon than the works of John Locke, for example, that is because more people want to read and learn about Klingon or are unable to find the information they desire elsewhere. In this way, Wikipedia is responsive to audience desires and needs. As such, there are few shortcomings in Wikipedia&rsquo;s coverage. If Locke was to come into vogue, then undoubtedly his page would soon expand to meet that demand.&nbsp;</p>
