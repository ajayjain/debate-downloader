    <h1 class="print-title">This House would embrace multiculturalism</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Multiculturalism is a somewhat nebulous term, and as such can be used to mean a variety of things. This debate, however, will concern itself with multiculturalism as meaning the preservation of a culture distinct from that of the majority of the population. That is, choosing to exist within a community with similar values, and making deliberate decisions to identify yourself with that community in ways that visibly set yourself apart from others in your country.</p>
<p>In UK politics, Bradford in the 1980s is often taken as an example of multiculturalism in action. A number of communities, in effect, lived side by side: the pre-existing white community, and the newly formed immigrant communities, who largely separated themselves by country and region. Picked out for special attention by the press and by later events, the Pakistani community was often held up as an example of one that rejected integration. Often new immigrants (particularly women) had poor English skills, and thus a great dependency of other immigrants for a sense of community. Parts of Bradford became known as &quot;Bradistan&quot; because of the prevalence of immigrants, and the various businesses set up in the area by immigrants, for immigrants (for example, shops selling products needed to produce traditionally Pakistani food).</p>
<p>Supporting multiculturalism, in the context of a debate, can mean anything from thinking that, in principle, it is better than integration, to supporting a range of policies that would enable a multicultural rather than integrated society to function (like funding for specific cultural projects, or religious schools).</p>

                    <p>Cultural heritage is often very important to people, particularly to new immigrants who are already feeling the loss of their old ways of life. It is a matter of luck whether we are born in a country with lots of opportunities, or are forced to travel if we wish to seek a better life. As such, we should not penalise such unfortunate people but rather allow them to continue to practice important cultural practices. Britain has introduced support for a number of non-Christian faith schools that both respect and encourage the faiths and cultures of its students, many of whom are first or second-generation immigrants.<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6986398.stm">&nbsp;BBC News, 'Faith schools set for expansion',</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>It may well be arbitrary where we are born, but that does not make it any less true: we make distinctions between citizens of one country and another country for practical purposes, and states have primary duties to their own citizens first and foremost. People in the host country also have a right to the preservation of their culture, and therefore if necessary incomers should integrate, and give up their cultural practices as the price paid for the benefits migration.</p>        </div>

May 21, 2007</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span> - &quot;When culture as constraint is employed as part of the argument against multiculturalism, there are also real problems with the policies that flow from this. This has been especially the case in those issues that hinge around tensions between multiculturalism and women&#39;s equality. In some of the most testing of these, it seems to be the women themselves who are making the cultural demand: girls and women saying that they want to cover their heads at school or a university, that they want the right to abort a foetus that has been diagnoses as female or want to marry an as-yet-unknown partner with their parent&#39;s country of origin. Critics of multicultural accommodation commonly discount this, claiming that their women are victims of their patriarchal culture, that what they are representing as their wish has been imposed on them by the men in their community and can therefore be safely ignored. In an increasing number of cases, governments have acted on these worries about cultural coercion by banning an entire practice.&quot;</p>

                    <p>There are a great many problems in many areas as a result of poor integration. Race riots, racial violence and the scapegoating of minority communities all tear communities apart. France has recently begun to forcibly evict communities of Roma from its cities after clashes between local communities and the travelling community of Roma<sup>1</sup>. Integration allows us to diffuse the "us and them" mentality: to see other people in terms of their similarities to, not their differences from, us. The resultant greater understanding of others makes community cohesion much more likely and the horrors of racial tension much less likely.</p><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/17/prejudice-widespread-europe">Tran, 'Prejudice and evictions widespread in Europe not just France, activists warn.'</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p>        </div>

<p><strong>Multiculturalism is democratic</strong> Democracy is built upon the notion that individuals may hold different beliefs and that they have the right to do so. In a democratic election, there is usually a more conservative group competing with a more liberal group; in the United States, this would be the Republicans versus the Democrats. Democracies are built upon individuals and groups believing different things, but coexisting. Similarly, a multicultural society acknowledges, respects, and even cherishes differences between groups. Realistically, societies are pluralistic. Because of its parallel with democracy, multiculturalism seems to be a more suitable and appropriate framework for a democratic society.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bostonreview.net/BR22.5/okin.html" title="http://www.bostonreview.net/BR22.5/okin.html">Susan Moller Okin. &quot;Is Multiculturalism Bad for Women?&quot;. Boston Review. 1999</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span> - &quot;Some proponents of group rights argue that even cultures that &quot;flout the rights of [their individual members] in a liberal society&quot;3 should be accorded group rights or privileges if their minority status endangers the culture&#39;s continued existence. Others do not claim that all minority cultural groups should have special rights, but rather that such groups&mdash;even illiberal ones, that violate their individual members&#39; rights, requiring them to conform to group beliefs or norms&mdash;have the right to be &quot;let alone&quot; in a liberal society.4 Both claims seem clearly inconsistent with the basic liberal value of individual freedom, which entails that group rights should not trump the individual rights of their members; thus, I will not address the problems they present for feminists here.5 But some defenders of multiculturalism largely confine their defense of group rights to groups that are internally liberal.6 Even with these restrictions, feminists&mdash;anyone, that is, who endorses the moral equality of men and women&mdash;should remain skeptical. So I will argue.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Assimilation expects immigrants to shed their cultural heritage It is expected that recent immigrants to a country will shed major parts of their cultures and values to adapt to those of the host country. But, this is unrealistic. Nobody will quickly shed and adopt the new cultural elements of a nation; a major flaw of the assimilation model. For example, America, often used as the prime example of assimilation, is not the melting pot once thought. America is a land of many cultures, where important and sustained cultural divisions between Americans persist. Assimilationist doctrine claims it is working towards a sense of one American-ness, but there are two problems with this notion. One, America is a land built on democratic difference&nbsp;– very different political groups can and do exist. Two, American assimilation has had a troubling history consisting of a dominating, white power structure aiming to restrict extending American citizen to all citizens, and denying human rights to all citizens (often because of race or skin colour).</p>        </div>

                    <p>Immigrants demonstrate their own willingness to integrate in their (often) strenuous efforts to reach their destination. In America, where thousands of migrants have fled over the last century, the assimilation process is a proven success. It is one of the most successful societies and economies in the world. It enjoys relative peace, cohesion, and civic engagement among its various groups&nbsp;– it’s two main political parties disagree often but agree on the fundamental freedoms of the American citizen. Furthermore, the success of the assimilation model is found in the civil rights movement that ultimately led to the election of Barack Obama in 2009. Such a compelling empirical example of assimilation is hard to compete with.</p><p>Furthermore, multi-culturalism is the more unrealistic model, requiring stereotypes that marginalize those that do not fit into the pre-existing compartments. In the UK, for example, individuals from the Middle East, but whom are not Muslim, may nevertheless be grouped into this category. This is wrong in principle, creates false distinctions and polarizations, and can create tensions where there were none before.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Integration is not a one-way process, in which the minority is subsumed into the mainstream. In reality, integration changes both the new immigrants and the existing community. Each can learn from the other, and take on their preferred cultural practices. Food is a good example; curry is consistently among the UK's favourite foods originally Indian but often altered to appeal more to the British. In this way, integration is a useful tool for ensuring that positive practices remain, whilst people are afforded the freedom to drop harmful or just sub-optimum practices into which they were coerced by the social pressures of their previously homogenous community.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Integration does not result in this mythical "marketplace of ideas" wherein you can choose between cultural components. Where there is insufficient government support and understanding of minority practices, people are forced to defend their own cultural identity, and as such find it harder to give up practices, and in some cases become more extreme. An example of this in the UK is the way in which, in the '80s when Rushdie published The Satanic Verses, and after 9/11, when the right of Muslims to live their life as they see fit was attacked, some young people in those communities adopted more extreme forms of Islam as a defence against the perceived attack upon their way of life.</p>        </div>

<p><a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/30150.html" title="http://www.reason.com/news/show/30150.html">Peter D. Salins. &quot;Assimilation, American Style&quot;. Reason Online. February 1997</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span> - &quot;The great hallmark of assimilation, American style is that immigrants are free to retain or discard as much or as little of their homeland cultures as they wish without compromising their assimilation. This fact is rarely recognized, however, in most discussions of the subject, allowing a misperception to stand that severely distorts the American debate about assimilation&#39;s desirability and possibility. The conventional judgment as to whether immigrants or their descendants are assimilating is usually based on how much of their native cultural heritages they have discarded and how culturally &#39;American&#39; they seem. By this standard, a foreign-born teenager listening to rock music on his Walkman, wearing a baseball cap backward, and speaking accent-free English is &#39;assimilated,&#39; whereas an Amish farmer is not. But the social characteristic being identified here is not really assimilation, but what Milton Gordon and other sociologists refer to as &#39;acculturation,&#39; conforming to superficial cultural features of the dominant society such as dress, speech, and etiquette.</p>
<p>Acculturation may or may not accompany assimilation. Usually, immigrants who assimilate-- or at least their children--become acculturated as well, but not always and not completely. Usually, acculturated people are assimilated, but again, not always. The distinction between assimilation and acculturation is crucial, and Gordon&#39;s decades-old insistence that acculturation is not synonymous with assimilation may be his greatest contribution to the theory of assimilation. Except for the need to speak English, acculturation, in the American historical context, may be meaningless, because it is unclear what it is that immigrants should be acculturating to.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the continuing predominance of English cultural and social influences, African-American, Hispanic, Jewish, Italian, Asian, and other ethnic influences are now deeply and ineradicably embedded in the national cultural mix, and new ethnic influences are changing that mix every day. Even international ethnic influences, detached from any immigrant cohorts, are at work changing the American &#39;national&#39; culture. For instance, the widespread appeal of Japanese products, architecture, and food is largely unrelated to the direct influence of the small cohort of Japanese-American immigrants.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Allowing people to preserve their own cultures allows other people to understand different cultural practices and ways of living life. This exposure to new experiences enriches the cultural practices of all: we are better able to make choices about the way in which we wish to live our lives, whether that is a matter of what food we eat or what religion we practice. The Amish community in rural America is just one example; 'it is not necessary to live an Amish life to appreciate what they can teach us', the mere knowledge that one can be happy without constant access to life's modern technologies is a humbling thought.<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20110726/NEWS0201/107260321">Hare, 'The Amish community can teach us a lot'.</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>In reality, multiculturalism is a form of segregation: cultural practices will not diffuse across the artificial borders, because people view the two communities as very distinct. That is, they view the cultural practices of other communities as something "they" rather than "we" do. True diversity is achieved through integration: even when people integrate they retain some of their cultural practices, and these can be experienced by others as something their friends do, rather than something a whole separate community does.</p>        </div>

<p>Multiculturalism may also utilize the term tolerance, but it could easily be suggested the appropriate term is more likely respect. On the other hand, assimilation would reject the notion of respect for ones cultural or ethnic identity. Any coexistence is &quot;tolerated&quot; with the expectation of assimilation in to the mainstream. The problem with tolerance versus respect is more than symantics. Tolerance retains the social hierarchy and contends the lesser group will be accepted, but still recognized for their place in the hierarchy. Some quotations on this include:</p>
<p><strong>Multiculturalism can help separate conflicting groups.</strong> In Britain, multiculturalism emerged as a means to manage conflicts between competing groups in the country. It was, in a sense, a way to separate groups that had long histories of fighting into their own neighborhoods. The effect of this ad hoc multiculturalism was a reduction in tension and instances of ethnic and religious violence. Assimilation, conversely, is frequently seen as producing spates of violence. One of the most notable examples is the 2005 riots in France, which many blame on France&#39;s assimilation policies.</p>

<p><strong>Multiculturalism&#39;s tolerance is a better principle than assimilation&#39;s exclusivity.</strong> Discrimination against any culture produces racial hatred and a lack of respect and tolerance for those who discriminated. So, what is better for the safety of the people? Accepting all cultures and thus not angering those cultures who may act upon anger or simply refusing some cultures and setting oneself up as a target? It seems the former.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Multiculturalism is just a nice term for ghettoization. It allows both individuals and policy makers to ignore the difficulties faced by immigrant populations who often wish to integrate with the mainstream, and is often used to justify inequalities between communities. A study of immigrant communities found that claims that British Asian communities were forming ghettos and did not want to mix was a myth. They instead found a 'strong wish to integrate with the mainstream, and is often used to justify inequalities between communities. A study of immigrant communities found that claims that British Asian communities were forming ghettos and did not want to mix was a myth.

This happens to such an extent that it becomes dangerous for the immigrant to be a part of the nation.

<p><strong>Multicultural states are typically unsuccessful.</strong> Having to do with problems of social cohesion, conflict, and even violence, multicultural states are typically less successful than states that adopt an assimilation model. The historical evidence seems to support this conclusion, and adds empirical credence to the idea that multiculturalism is damaging to a state. As a national model for success, therefore, multiculturalism seems to fail the test. And, since the success of the international community and economy depends on successful states, multiculturalism can also be considered potentially damaging to the international system.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://debatepedia.idebate.org/en/index.php/Argument:_Multiculturalism_can_damage_social_capital_and_cohesion" title=" Multiculturalism can damage social capital and cohesion">Multiculturalism can damage social capital and cohesion</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span></strong> Some empirical studies by such acclaimed scholars as Robert Putnam conclude that the historical record shows multiculturalism to have failed in producing successful, cohesive, long-lasting states. The primary problem is that it diminishes what is called &quot;social capital&quot;. That is, the groupings and divisions caused by multiculturalism separate groups from each other and reduce trust, diminishing such things as civic engagement and community involvement. A cycle of distrust disrupts community and societal cohesiveness and productivity. At least, these are the presumable explanations deduced from the empirical evidence that indicates that multicultural societies are less successful overall.</p>
<p><strong>Multiculturalism can lead to class conflict</strong> Among the various distinctions created in the multiculturalism model are class distinctions. Creating such clear distinctions creates an atmosphere of &quot;us against them&quot;, which is particularly virulent when applied to socio-economic status.&nbsp;</p>
