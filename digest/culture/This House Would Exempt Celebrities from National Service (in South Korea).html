    <h1 class="print-title">This House Would Exempt Celebrities from National Service (in South Korea)</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The border between North and South Korea is the most heavily fortified in the world. Officially, the Korean War has never ended and the two countries have maintained merely a nervous coexistence since the end of formal hostilities in 1953. Both sides maintain enormous armies and have mandatory national service. It is worth noting that the forms of national service differ enormously; although 22 months<a href="/print/17761#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> for virtually all men in the South may seem long, it pales into insignificance with the 10 years in the North. Typically around the world where there is national service 18 months is standard increasing to two years in some countries.</p><p>There has been a discernible generational shift in attitudes towards national service in recent years most obviously demonstrated by the efforts of celebrities and the sons of senior politicians and business leaders to avoid the draft. The lengths to which some will go are extraordinary, for example Shin Dong-Hyun, a hip-hop artist better known as MC Dong pulled out his own, healthy, teeth in an effort to fail the physical exam<a href="/print/17761#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. More common methods are either the mundane such as drinking too much coffee to increase blood pressure before the medical or the rather more extreme such as changing nationality as was the case with singer Yoo Seung-Jun. Yoo had emigrated to the US as a child with his family but repeatedly said that he would complete his national service. Just before he was due to be conscripted in 2002, however, he adopted naturalised American citizenship, making him exempt. The public outcry was huge and led the government to ban him from performing on the peninsula.</p><p>Opinion is divided on the matter with many accepting that celebrities need to be in the public eye constantly otherwise they quickly fade from public memory and that they probably have only until they are about thirty, the cut off point for performing national service, before their career is over. Others take the attitude that celebrities are simply trying to use their status to avoid doing something that nobody else really wants to do either.</p><p>Some celebrities such as the singer Rain have made a point of performing their duty and it makes for a major news story when they enrol and start basic training. In Rain’s case one British Newspaper went so far as to describe him as “South Korea’s Modern-Day Elvis”<a href="/print/17761#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> in reference to Elvis Presley’s being drafted in 1957.</p><p>The fact that sportsmen, like entertainers, face particular challenges in taking a two year break from their careers at an age when they are at the height of their powers is recognised by the South Korean government. Athletes who win an Olympic gold, or a similar achievement, are given an exemption from service. No such provision applies for entertainers. Although there was international coverage of Rain’s entering the army, it will be interesting to see whether the hundreds of fans who turned up to bid farewell to the K-Pop idol on his first day in uniform will be back at the barracks gates when he completes his service in two years’ time.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17761#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Actually, 21 months in the army, 23 months in the navy and 24 months in the air force</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17761#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/n_feature/2010/09/06/94/4901000000AEN20100906003800315F.HTML">Yonhap News</a>, 13 September 2010</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17761#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/12/rain-south-korean-elvis-army">The Guardian,</a> 12 October 2011</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-text field-field-debate-authors">

                    <p>The South Korean government issues occasional exemptions to athletes who have won an Olympic gold medal or achieved a similar feat. If we accept that the law ought to be consistent then there is no reason why entertainers should not be proffered the same opportunity. Both professions tend to favour the young and the requirement that military service needs to be completed before the age of thirty mean that either career would be interrupted just at the point when the individual is likely to be at the height of their skills.</p><p>Equally both groups bring prestige for Korea as a nation. Entertainers like Jung-Ji Hoon (Rain) have just as much of a following as athletes such as Park Ji-Sung who, along with his team mates on the Korean national team was exempted from military service for reaching the semi-finals of the world cup<a href="/print/17761#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p><p>Indeed Rain predominantly works in Korea and has a following throughout the country and the region whereas Park has spent most of his career playing for foreign teams.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17761#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://arsenal-mania.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=142342&amp;start=30">Arsenal Forum</a>, August 30 2011</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Celebrities, unlike athletes, work for themselves whereas athletes represent the country. Military service means representing the nation to the rest of the world as does being an athlete, that’s the reason for the exemption, not simply a matter of celebrity.</p><p>The psychologist Hwang Sang-Min<a href="/print/17761#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> has made clear that “Entertainers are thought to work for their own sakes. That’s the difference.”</p><p>Park Ji-Sung and his teammates were representing their country and achieved a national first. Granting an exemption recognised their accomplishment on behalf of the country. In a very literal meaning of the phrase they performed national service.</p><p>Equating such an accomplishment with a performer who is simply doing their job – for which they are well paid – misses the point of the exemptions. Singers and actors happen to be Korean; they are not acting or singing for Korea. Indeed given the speed with which some performers have given up their nationality in a bid to avoid national service, comparing it to a genuine national accomplishment seems absurd.</p><p>When actors such as Song Seung-heon attempted to avoid national service they were rightly decried and their actions have far more in common with the sons of politicians and businessmen who seek to use their status to avoid the draft.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17761#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.salon.com/writer/jin_man_lee/">Salon.com</a>, Jim Lee, Pop Sensation Rain Joins the South Korean Army</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The career path of celebrities is unusual in that it accretes over time on the basis of the performers standing in the public mind. Unlike other professions this does not lend itself to taking two years out of the limelight, especially years when fame is coming to its height.</p><p>The media is notoriously fickle and equally well-known for having a short memory. It generally struggles to stay interested in a celebrity if they’re out of the limelight for more than a few weeks. It is simply unfeasible that they would remain interested when someone has been out of the spotlight for over two years. In effect this means that for a Korean musician or actor their career will finish at the age of 29.</p><p>In other profession it is possible to build a career around national service and employers know that at some point any young man they employ will need to undertake their military service but celebrities simply aren’t employed in this way.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Anyone setting out on such a career is aware of the legal requirement to undertake service in the armed forces. There is absolutely nothing to stop them doing it before they start their career. There are plenty of jobs where it is inconvenient to have to take an extended break. Anything relating to technology or research, for example, where there is a need to keep up to date with the latest developments in the field is fairly unforgiving of such a break and so people build their careers around it, knowing that at some point they will be out of the loop for 24 months or so.</p><p>To suggest that it is more important that a pop star is able to keep on recording but that it is for scientist and technicians in the most wired country in the world to keep up with changes in technology is as inconsistent as it is unfair. The case of the performer is clearly weaker it’s simply that they have the status and fame to mean that they can make a big fuss about it and people will notice.</p><p>Whatever the vanity of celebrity may suggest it’s just another job and it’s questionable as to how much benefit it actually provides to society at large.</p><p>Further pandering to that vanity by suggesting that society can’t cope without a particular singer or actor for two years is ridiculous. There is no shortage of people wanting to do the job.</p>        </div>

                    Having the age of 30 as the cut-off point is uniquely unfair to performers as this is the age when they are likely to be at the height of their fame and towards the end of their career.        </div>

                    <p>For most professions, getting military service out of the way early in one’s career makes sense. Nobody would suggest that members of other professions should be expected to interrupt it when they are at the height of their profession. In reality for most people this would be when they are in their fifties.&nbsp; For professions like acting and music this tends to be the late twenties and early thirties. Indeed, for pop singers in particular their career is likely to be over when they are 35.</p><p>In the light of this setting the age limit where it is is uniquely unfair to performers – just as it is to athletes.</p><p>Military service anywhere in the world is considered to be something you undertake before your career, not in the middle of it. Regulations should reflect reality, in this instance that means allowing performers to get on with their careers.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Again, there is nothing to stop celebrities doing their military service before they start performing but, even were that not the case, military service is not something that is undertaken because it is convenient or easy but rather something that is done because it is necessary.

                    <p>There may well be a case to be made that certain other professions or groups should be given exemptions. That does not, however, demonstrate that celebrities should not.

                    <p>At a time when the 1950-53 war is becoming less relevant to peoples’ daily lives and all generations, particularly the youngest, are becoming reluctant to fulfil their duty in a country that is still at war, celebrities have a powerful opportunity to act as role models for others to fulfil their national service obligations.</p><p>Allowing them an opt out would set a terrible example. By definition they are of a generation with others entering the military and there is a powerful symbolism in their doing so as well.</p><p>By contrast allowing them an exemption would encourage others to try and find a way out of serving.</p><p>Although it seems probable that in the event of a conflict the main protagonists would be the USA and China rather than the conscript armies of North and South Korea, there would seem to be a definite benefit in having the male population trained sufficiently well to take on civil defence duties and to be able to ensure their own safety and that of their families.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It seems, frankly unfair to ask people to destroy their careers on the basis that it will encourage others to do something that the law already requires of them. The legislation for national service was structured on the basis of a country that was very different from modern day Korea. In 1953 Korea was the poorest country in the world and national service was, among other things, a useful tool for training and providing employment for the young. That is simply no longer the case. The legislation and the principals that underpin it are simply not designed to deal with a Korean in their twenties who is already recognised around the world and has a staggeringly successful career.</p><p>It’s clear that the framers acknowledged that there was at least one profession where people could excel while still young – hence the exemption for highly successful athletes. The fact is that 60 years ago the idea of a rapper, singer or actor who could genuinely promote Korea around the world was simply not there.</p>        </div>
