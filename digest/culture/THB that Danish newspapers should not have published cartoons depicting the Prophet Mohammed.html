    <h1 class="print-title">THB that Danish newspapers should not have published cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>In September 2005, the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten posted a series of cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Mohammed, sometimes in ways associating Mohammed with terrorism or extremist Islam. While the content of the images were offensive in themselves the offense is made much worse as graphic depictions of Mohammed are not permitted in Islam.&nbsp; The editors of the newspaper explained that their publishing the cartoons was an act of protest against Islamic demands for self-censorship, feeling that those values were incompatible with western liberal democracy.&nbsp; These cartoons were subsequently reprinted by other newspapers in Europe, often in reaction to the protests against the cartoons.</p><p>Public protests erupted among Muslims in Denmark and Europe, and were soon followed by protests and violence in the Middle East, including attacks on the Danish embassies in Iran, Syria, Indonesia, and Lebanon.&nbsp; The European Union noted its disapproval of the publication.&nbsp; Death threats against the cartoonists and editors were issued by various Islamic leaders, eventually causing the newspaper’s editors to apologize and Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh to issue a statement of regret and apology.</p><p>It is unlikely that the exact same circumstances will recur, so debates on this issue will either be in the past – as this is set out, or will be drawing upon the issue to provide examples and understanding of what may happen in similar circumstances.&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>The cartoons were intended as a democratic challenge to self-censorship, and the Danish courts recognized this when they rejected lawsuits that Muslim groups in Denmark filed against the newspaper on the grounds of hate speech.<a href="/print/17797#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p>Furthermore, the cartoons were targeted against the extremist fringe of Islam, and were narrowly tailored to object to the use of violent means in furthering religious causes.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong about pointing out the high incidence rate of terrorism and violence within radical components of a worldwide Islamic community that encompasses many different types of people spread over many nationalities.&nbsp; Ever since 9/11, terrorism and conservative interpretations of Islam have constantly been on the public mind and constitute a legitimate topic for discourse. It is not a hate crime to publicise cartoons that highlight this; cartoons in newspapers target groups who are otherwise in the news all the time, bankers for example, this does not mean they are inciting hatred against that group.</p><div><div id="edn1"><p><a href="/print/17797#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a> Olsen, Jan M., ‘Danish Court Rejects Suit Against Paper That Printed Prophet Cartoons’, <em>The Washington Post</em>, 27 October 2006, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/26/AR2006102601650.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/26/AR2006102601650.html</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The publication of the cartoons empowered the radical fringes of many Muslim populations, by enabling them to point to the cartoons as tangible evidence of an anti-Muslim bias and anti-Muslim agenda in the West.<a href="/print/17797#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a>&nbsp; For instance, in Pakistan, these were used against the president, General Pervez Musharraf, who was perceived as being too closely aligned with the United States.&nbsp; Religious leaders who wanted to make the case that Denmark was deliberately offensive and a hostile environment for Muslims were able to conflate popular knowledge about the cartoon controversy with other incidents (some of them not even in Denmark) and sway support to their anti-ecumenical causes.<a href="/print/17797#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This set back reasonable discourse in Muslim communities about how best to integrate with the West, and ultimately resulted in the weakening of internal forces that encourage acceptance of Western culture.
