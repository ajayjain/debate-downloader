    <h1 class="print-title">This House would replace Christmas with a festival for everyone</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Christmas is traditionally seen as a Christian religious festival whereby the birth of Jesus is celebrated, it is celebrated by Christians annually around the entire world, however it presence as a festival is arguably strongest in the western world where Christianity was historically and still tends to be the dominant religion. However, many Western nations are, like no other time before, much more multicultural with communities no longer being entirely Christian but being made-up of an elaborate mix of belief systems such as Hinduism, Sikhism or even Atheism to name but a few. Many religions as well as Christianity also celebrate festivals around the winter period and those which belong to belief systems that do not have events around Christmas time still often join in with the festivities in a non-religious capacity, this has led to some people and organizations rather than wishing people Merry Christmas, which is a religious specific, to using greetings such as Happy Holidays. As a result there is an accusation claiming that this change in language is &quot;de-Christianizing&quot; Christmas; media copy around this argument is now annual fodder for news organizations with many claiming that Christmas has been banned; stories can, for example, range from primary schools in Britain choosing not to stage a traditional nativity play, to American public authorities not being allowed to put up a crib display, and public displays of festive lights being renamed &quot;Winterval&quot;, &quot;Winter Lights&quot; or &quot;Luminos&quot;. So if Christmas is no longer a Christian festival, should Western states effectively ban it in public spaces and replace Christmas celebrations with generic celebrations of the holiday season?</p>

                    <p>A ban on Christmas is not only an affront on freedom of expression but it would not be police-able. If a state attempted to prevent its communities and schools having Christmas celebrations, how would it ensure they weren't occurring?<br>As the majority of Western nations have populations that are majority-Christian, any ban would only lead to a backlash of public opinion – community leaders, teachers and parents would be driven to disregard the ban and celebrate the event. As a coalition of Christian and Muslim leaders stated in 2006, banning Christmas will only lead to a backlash against Muslims, undermining the very goals of the ban<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, Christian teachers teaching their overwhelmingly-Christian students in public schools are going to continue to teach their students about Christmas – there is no efficient means to prevent this occurring. Calling attention to it through a public ban would only encourage teachers to flout the ban and undermine its very intention.</p><p>If a ban would not stop the festival from being celebrated and spoken about in public places and schools, what is the point?</p><p><sup>1&nbsp;</sup><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-419740/Campaign-real-Christmas-Religious-leaders-unite-political-correctness.html">Daily Mail, "Campaign for a real Christmas", 2006.</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>The difficulty of enforcing a ban is no reason to not do it. The intention of the ban, and the motive underpinning it, is what matters. In this case, the ban demonstrates to all citizens that the state does not have its 'favorites', that all are equal and the state respects their freedom of religion and their freedom from religion equally. What one does in the privacy of their own home is up to them, but the state refuses to publicly sanction and support festivals specific to one group at the expense of others.</p><p>If all state decisions were held back due to fears about public backlash, not much would occur. Christian teachers may indeed push on with Christmas celebrations, but they would do so illegally and the minority that get caught would get punished and act as a deterrent to others looking to do the same.</p>        </div>

                    <p>To members of ethnic minority groups overt public celebrations of Christmas can seem like a form of aggressive evangelism. It is an ethical duty of both Christians and society more generally to respect the beliefs of others, this makes the term "Happy Holidays" a much more appropriate greeting as it takes into account the mid-winter festivals of other faiths and cultures such as Hanukkah, Kwanza, Diwali, Eid, Ashura, to name a few. The Red Cross in 2003 banned nativity decorations from its British shops because it stated that an alignment to a particular religion could compromise its ability to work in conflict situations around the world<sup>1</sup>. It is a Christian ideal to be tolerant of others, and limiting the use of the term Christmas in favor of more inclusive terms would be an incredible display of this, the term Christmas would not be banned, but its use limited to specific occasions in which it specifically refers to Christian based activities rather than the general celebration that is seen throughout the mid-winter period.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/4190/">Mirza, M. &nbsp;Christmas is banned!

                    <p>Christianity is entirely respectful to others, this can be seen particular in contrast to extreme factions of other religions which desire complete dominance. Christians and western nations do not seek to ban the celebration of other religious festivals, however this does not give consent to mothball all winter festivals into a singular name, many other religions as well as the Christianity are against this. While the feelings of ethnic minority groups should be took into consideration it must be remembered that Christianity is often the dominant religion in many western countries, Christianity is on the whole not trying to aggressively force their religion onto others, however if a majority wish to celebrate it they should be allowed to, should Hanukkah become more dominant that would equally rise to the top, the expression of religion on the whole should not be regulated, all religions should have the right to celebrate their distinctness throughout the mid-winter period.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Language is powerful. By removing the term Christmas the Christian festivities are not only being undermined but it is allowing the traditions to be appropriated by those with an agenda to force secularization onto society. Referring to all the various festivals by a variety of different religions as one integrated event known as the "The Holidays" or "Winterval" belittles and corrupts the uniqueness of each individual festival and stands to threaten religious identity<sup>1</sup>. Muslim Dubai has already demonstrated that even other faiths are happy to celebrate Christmas, with some spectacular Christmastime displays. Religious leaders in Britain have therefore hit back against the secular agenda, arguing 'it fails to understand the concerns of religious communities'<sup>1</sup>. The secular ideal is to create a society in which everyone has the same (non)belief-system, this goes against the Western ideal of freedom of choice. The issue may seem trivial to some but it is important that political correctness does not go too far and rip away traditions under the guise of progress. The use of neutral symbols such as snowmen and reindeer are an affront to the traditions of Christmas; continuous attacks on Christianity threaten the moral fabric of western societies and should not be embraced on a flawed ethical notion.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-419740/Campaign-real-Christmas-Religious-leaders-unite-political-correctness.html"> Daily Mail.

                    <p>It is correct to state that language is powerful, and that is precisely why moving to a more neutral term would be more beneficial for society as a whole. Western nations are now both individualistic and multicultural, therefore the change in language simply reflects the changes in society. The change is not being forcibly done in order to create a secular society, language is dynamic and always changes, this change is reflecting the fact that Christianity no longer dominates. Western countries are no longer single religion nations, as a result language changes in tandem with this social change, shops for example do not want to isolate potential customers by putting them of with religious imagery and language which may not resonate and could even repulse, they are not part of conspiratorial cabal trying to bring doing Christianity they just want to appeal to the majority of society. There is no out-right ban on use of language or symbology, there is freedom of choice, people and organizations can display religious icons if they wish to however people are simply choosing to use less overt symbols nowadays in regards to Christmas festivities.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Public celebrations and festivals are all either organized or funded by the state, or otherwise have to gain their approval before they can go ahead. Therefore, if the state were to decide that Christmas celebrations were to be banned, it would be a fairly simple process to ensure they were stopped. The British city of Birmingham in 1998 altered the name of its Christmas festival to 'Winterval', proving it can be done<sup>1</sup>. At public schools, states have a means to inform principals that Christmas celebrations will not be permitted. Punishments to individual principals whose schools do not obey could act as a deterrent to certain individuals informing their teachers to act contrary to the ban and thereafter claiming deniability.<br><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-419740/Campaign-real-Christmas-Religious-leaders-unite-political-correctness.html">Daily</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-419740/Campaign-real-Christmas-Religious-leaders-unite-political-correctness.html"> Mail.

                    <p>Such a ban would be impossible to enforce and therefore achieve little. Christmas celebrations are not consigned to those in schools and public places. A state cannot prevent individuals and communities from celebrating Christmas – an attempt to do so would merely encourage those celebrating to do so on a grander scale. Such a tactic therefore would achieve the opposite of its intention – drawing attention to the Christian-ness of the population and encouraging Christians to flaunt their religion and celebrate ‘their’ Christmas. Muslim fears in the UK that it would lead to a backlash against them are well-founded<sup>1</sup>. If the state was truly concerned about integration of religious communities, they would celebrate Christmas openly each year and a whole host of other festivals in between.</p><p><sup>1&nbsp;</sup><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-419740/Campaign-real-Christmas-Religious-leaders-unite-political-correctness.html">Daily Mail, "Campaign for a real Christmas" 2006.</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Western countries are Christian societies, shaped over centuries by the Christian church. Some, such as the UK, still have an official state church and many others (e.g. Germany, France) support churches with money in some ways. All western nations however recognize Christmas Day as a public holiday. In the USA many people would argue that the courts have shut religion out of public life in a way that the Founding Fathers never intended. Such Christian countries should not turn their back upon their heritage and the faith background of the large majority of their citizens. This means Christmas (and other Christian festivals, such as Easter) should continue to be marked officially with public displays. The state can also mark other faith holidays in some way, but it is right that Christmas gets most official attention as it is the most important Christian festival and as Western nations were built upon Christian ideals it should therefore be of great importance to recognize it in its full Christian form. Banning Christmas is to reject the fundamental ideas which lead to the creation of western states as we know them today. As Trevor Phillips, chairman of the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission, stated: 'it's fine to celebrate and it's fine for Christ to be the star of the show'; it's time to put the Christ back in Christmastime<sup>1</sup>.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/4190/">Mirza, M.

                    <p>Modern nations in the West were built not upon Christian ideals, but a desire for multi-culturalism and inclusiveness that is ignored each December during Christmas celebrations.<br>The United States' founding fathers made it very clear in their first amendment that the state should make no law respecting an establishment of religion. Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers, sent a letter dated 1802 that referred to the 'wall of separation between church and state'. State-sanctioned Christmas holidays therefore do not reflect the ideals of the US' founding fathers.<br>Furthermore, even if were the case that Western nations were built upon Christian ideals, it is the ability to change and adapt that has allowed nations to develop. While religion may have aided societal development it is blinded to suggest that simply because religion helped form societies that we should remain totally loyal to its dogma, secularism for example has also played a key role in the modern development of society, as well as influences from other faiths.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Christmas celebrations in the Western world, held in schools and public squares, do not respect the rights of those who are not religious. For school children who do not share the majority-Christian faith, Christmas celebrations require either their participation when they do not want to, through coercion, or their non-participation and therefore isolation whilst everyone else celebrations their inclusiveness. States should instead be sponsoring and celebrating events that everyone can join in equally, regardless of religion, race or class. 'Happy Holidays' is a generic term for the December break that does not discriminate between Christians and non-Christians, or indeed between the religious and the non-religious. Furthermore, even Christmas symbols like the Christmas symbol could be co-adopted to appeal to non-Christians; Boston in 2005 re-named its Christmas Tree to 'Holiday Tree'<sup>1</sup>. A tolerant, multi-cultural state would not stop there, but ban the public naming of Christmas and celebrate the 'holidays' instead.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-12-01-trimming-debate_x.htm"> Bazar, E.

                    <p>The Christmas break is no longer a Christian festival, but a multi-cultural celebration during Christmas; the state should not be sponsoring events specific to Christians during a holiday for all religious and non-religious citizens. Christmas is now celebrated not only in Western nations but the world over, it is celebrated not only by individuals which are not Christian but whole nations which do not subscribe to the Christian belief system. The holiday has transcended its origins, while it still represents some conceptual Christian notions it is no longer for the most part a Christian festival. Much of the symbolism now used has more relation to Pagan traditions than Christian ones with things such as the Christmas tree and mistletoe originating from the pre-Christian religion, in addition other common symbols have come from popular culture such as snowmen and reindeer. Very rarely now are the traditional symbols of a Christian Christmas actually displayed publicly or even in the homes of Christians themselves, with many preferring the symbolism of the modern multi-cultural Christmas. A UK study found that three out of four employers have banned Christmas decorations because they are concerned not to offend other faiths<sup>1</sup>. It seems only logical to describe public displays by other terminology as this would reflect more truly on the celebrations of the winter period.<br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/boxarticle/2299/">Furedi, F.

                    <p>Christmas is no longer solely a Christian festival, but that is in fact more of a reason to retain its history and cherish the inclusiveness of the celebrations. While it is certainly true that Christmas is celebrated by many more people than just Christians, this inclusiveness should be noted by the state and used as an opportunity to bring communities and religions together. People who are not Christian who engage with the festival will still know the reason behind the celebration, the birth of Christ and will more widely know what he did with his time on earth. It is true that mixed in with Christian symbology there are now many other symbols from a non-Christian non-religious background, what this demonstrates is the liberalness of the Christian faith showing that it can adapt to modern trends as long as the core message remains, this should not be exploited as a way to neutralize the power of the religion through political correctness restraints but should be applauded and garter respect. Due to this ability to adapt Christmas can be enjoyed by all and still maintain its Christian roots without the need to change the terminology of the festival.</p>        </div>
