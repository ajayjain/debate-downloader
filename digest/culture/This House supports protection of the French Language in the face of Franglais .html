    <h1 class="print-title">This House supports protection of the French Language in the face of Franglais </h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>English is the language of the superpower that is America, the Internet and of computers. Therefore, it is not uncommon to see and hear European languages laden with Anglicisms. This English influence over French words is known as Franglais. This word itself is a fusion of Français and Anglais, the French words for French and English. Examples of this Franglais are le parking (car park), un walkman (as opposed to the French term un balladeur) and un post-it (a post-it note). Other European languages have been similarly affected by English. The German, Spanish and Welsh counterparts of Franglais are known as Deuglish, Spanglish and Wenglish.</p><p>Franglais is that breed of French words that are heavily influenced by the English language; faire le shopping (translated literally means to do shopping) is commonly used instead of faire les magasins (translated literally means to do the shops). Un relooking is used for make over and is a Franglais term which has not been established by simply importing an English word into French and leaving it unchanged, such as le fast food. Instead, rather creatively, un relooking has been created using the tools of English phraseology to form a word that does not even exist in English!&nbsp;</p><p>In French, this prevalence of English influences is perhaps no greater than in other European languages, but is doubtless met with more animosity. In March 2006, the then French President Jacques Chirac addressed the EU in English. This move was not only met with great hostility from the French public, it prompted a walkout protest from the French ministers in attendance. They doubtless labelled this an act of Anglo-snobberie, (sic) the French derogatory term for Franglais, practiced only by Anglosnobs (sic). This would certainly be the view taken by Defense de la langue française, a body which wants to eliminate the use of Franglais and to promote the French language.</p><p>Is the Franglais a playful use of words or is it an erosion of the French language? Does the state have the right to tell the individual which lexicon they may and may not use? Is Franglais simply a counterpart to the Anglophone use of Gallicisms? Languages change and have always changed; is it futile to try and intervene with such a natural occurrence? Or do these views turn a blind eye to the emotive issue of protecting the French language from absorbing too much English? It is surely necessary to further protect the French language in light of anglicisms by handing more power to the Défense de a langue française. This move would increase the protection of the French language. The Défense de la languae française has the power to set and increase the quota of French language songs played on the radio at peak hours and to think up alternative, more French-sounding words for technological appliances tht are generally known by their English names even in French homes. Such measures would stop the Anglo influence that reigns on the French language, seemingly through new technology and modern equipment. In order to really protect the French language against English influences, this issue of language protection will have to be promoted.&nbsp; That is to say, the French people must be in sympathy with it to a certain degree already. However, if the use of Anglicisms is so great because the French are happy using English –influenced language, is this a complete waste of time?</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>Franglais has connotations of English and French conflict such as the Norman conquest and the Hundred Years’ War and is a mark of disrespect and impertinence towards the French.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, for the French culture to be immersed in this is ridiculous and immoral and the French people deserve to have their language protected against it.</p><p>For example, as explained by Nicholas Ridley, Winston Churchill addressed General de Gaulle during the Second World War with an unrefined Franglias-ridden threat; “Monsieur le General, markez vous mes mots. Si vous me doublecrosserez, je vous liquidaterai”<a href="/print/17746#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> (sic!) In this quotation, (which is not standard French) Winston Churchill made up the ‘French’ words and phraseology by taking English words and applying French grammar endings thereto in order to be rude; He was using Franglais to embarrass the French.</p><p>Therefore, the increased protection of the French language is necessary so that the English terminology that carries with it connotations of derision against the French be dissolved.</p><div><a href="/print/17746#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/My_style_of_government.html?id=ullnAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">Ridley, Nicholas, <em>My style of government: The Thatcher years</em>, Hutchinson, 1991, page 159</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There is a need for a progression in attitudes. The past and political history should not impinge on our freedom to choose our own words in the modern day, particularly when those political divisions no longer exist.&nbsp; An example is that the English call a certain flower a sweet William, but the Scots name it a stinking Billy as a result of the king who oppressed the Scots in favour of the English. However, England and Scotland have been unified for some three hundred years. Scotland has not elected independence, although such a party exists. Therefore, the memory remains, reflected by and encased in this use of language, but the original emotion does not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Previous negative connotations of using Franglais or English to be rude to the French happened in the past where they belong. Surely, if the French use English themselves, they reclaim, take back, and use in defiance a language structure that has previously been used impertinently towards them.</p>        </div>

                    <p>How a people see the world is encased in the words they use to communicate with each other and the words they use to write songs, poems and stories about their people’s history and experiences. Culture is inseparable from language. For example, the ‘e’ on the end of a word that is silent in everyday speech becomes pronounced in French poetry and song when it figures on the end of a line, thus adding an extra syllable to that line, and so “femme” on the end of a line of poetry would not be pronounced “fam”, but “fam-mer”, and so an extra syllable results. This principal also helps to create more rhymes within the poetry and song. Therefore, in order to keep the French culture alive, we must too protect its home language from falling to the globally dominant language of English. This is why we need an increased awareness and presence of francophone art; higher quotas of Francophone songs on the radio and the same of Francophone programmes on television. These two examples demonstrate how the culture itself can be better protected when the language is better upheld<span style="font-weight: bold;">. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>But these two nations DO have shared history and these Anglicisms in the French language are only a reflection on this. For example, the British call a particular brass instrument a French horn, but the French call it un cor anglais, in translation, an English horn. Certainly, how a people see the world is encased and reflected in the language they use, and their history and their relations with other nations is not separable from this vision of the world. <em>Au contraire</em>, it is integral to it. It is unlikely that historical events embedded so deep in memory that are reflected through language are likely to disappear just because certain words are deemed unacceptable by a certain body like Défense de la langue française.</p>        </div>

                    <p>There are four levels of French language. In descending order of formality these are; Précieux (snobby, poetic), Soutenu (literary, written), Courant (public, administrative), Familier (informal language, non-standard popular terms), Argotique (very informal language, offensive if used in the wrong context or said to a stranger).<a href="/print/17746#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> “the Middle Ages (ninth century – fifteenth century)…[saw] the emergence of a new standard language, replacing Latin.”<a href="/print/17746#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Since French - if not began, at least ‘grew up’- it has functioned with these four levels of formality. Franglais is not standard French, although many Franglais nouns (un post-it, un walkman) would be acceptable in a formal context, and its presence, uprising and prevalence threatens the use and survival of the more formal versions of the language.</p><p>It is important that the French people are not seduced by the English language but instead know their mother tongue properly and can appreciate and understand these four levels. The acceptance of Franglais and Anglicisms within the French language means there could well be a whole generation of French whose mother tongue is punctuated and littered with Anglicisms.</p><p>If English influences are allowed to prevail in the French language, then soon any linguist who writes about the French language will only be able to see it in relation to the English language that influences it; and not as a language in its own right with those four differing levels of formality.</p><p>If the French language is protected, it will not only be protected against English but against becoming degraded into a language littered with wrong usage; good French will be upheld and defended against bad French.</p><div><a href="/print/17746#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Exploring_the_French_language.html?id=ayrroSxIfB8C&amp;redir_esc=y">Lodge, R.

                    <p>Quod semper (as it always was). French has previously relaxed the formality of its language and has always changed by absorbing foreign influences.&nbsp;</p><p>Latin was the language of the legal courts and of schools and universities until the fifteenth century, when French became acceptable in these settings. Until then, French was used as the medium in less prestigious contexts.</p><p>As explained in Exploring the French language, “we can say that the core of French vocabulary comes from Latin.”<a href="/print/17746#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> However, this is not the only foreign influence; “from the eighth century BC and for about 1000 years, the inhabitants of Gaul spoke a Celtic language (Gaulish)…As the Gauls shifted language, it appears that they brought over into their Latin a Gaulish ‘accent’ and a certain number of Gaulish words have remained in the (French) language ever since e.g.</p><p>carrum&gt; char</p><p>dunam&gt; dune”.</p><p>Similarly, Germanic languages have also given rise to words in the French language.&nbsp;</p><p>To protect French in the face of Franglais is to arrest the natural development of the French language and foreign-infused changes that have always occurred therein. No governing language body would be able to affect the natural way in which language and word meanings change and develop, and so protection of the French language seems futile and unrealistic.</p><div><br clear="all"><a href="/print/17746#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Exploring_the_French_language.html?id=ayrroSxIfB8C&amp;redir_esc=y">Lodge, R.

                    <p>The French language cannot realistically survive if is not upheld as a relevant and respected language in official contexts. It is a very emotive and sensitive issue for the French people. The EU was founded by a Frenchman, Robert Schuman, France and Germany were two of the five founding members, the Union was created to ally France with Germany and before Britain joined, the French vetoed Britain’s entry. Now, the French feel their part is Europe is becoming diluted by the use of English. By forcing them to accept the English language in the context of an EU meeting only opens the gate to making them accept the same rules as other nations; if their own language is silenced, so too is their voice of expression and opposition.</p><p>The following example demonstrates the reality of the threat to the French language being used correctly in formal contexts. In March, 2005, the then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac shocked and appalled his people by making an address to the European Union in English. French representatives present walked out in protest.</p><p>The Times reported in Franglais and somewhat comically on the predominance of English in the Union; "Ils s’adresseraint l’Union Européenne cinq fois every day en franglais" (sic!).<a href="/print/17746#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> When translated from Franglais into English, it reads They address the European Union every day in Franglais. The article implies that Franglais has overtaken standard français as the accepted means of French communication within the European Union.</p><p>It is time for more language protection through active measures by the French Government and Défense de la langue française took the matter of defending the French language seriously, and so the measures of increased exposure to French language songs, television shows and films is necessary, as are more French –sounding nouns for referring to modern inventions which are generally just known by their English names in France.</p><div><a href="/print/17746#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> The Times, Saturday, 25th March, 2005</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>English is a valid language in the European Union. If M. Chirac, M. Sarkozy or any French leader wish to express him/herself in this language in order to improve diplomacy with their neighbours across the Channel, they have that very right.</p><p>European leaders falling out is a very real problem. In his book My style of government: The Thatcher years, Nicholas Ridley remembers the “difficult patches in her (Margaret Thatcher’s) relationships with some of the European leaders.”<a href="/print/17746#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It is highly likely that M. Chirac wanted to address the European Union in English in order to improve or maintain good relations with his Anglophone neighbours across the Channel. This choice, made by a Frenchman himself, is not to be assumed anti-Francophone, rather tactful.</p><p>Therefore, in the case of EU relations, French does not necessarily deserve more recognition nor protection in the face Anglophone influences.

                    <p>This borrowing the two languages works both ways. As a hangover from the Norman Invasion, there are often more than one English words that pertain to the same concept and for each of these, one option is of French origin. For example to ‘ask’ and to ‘demand’; the latter is derived from the French noun demander (seen here in the infinitive) meaning to ask.</p><p>Moreover, it is commonplace for Anglophones to use Gallicisms (French terminology); je ne sais quoi, cul de sac, pour encourager des autres, au contraire, en route, têtê à têtê, rendez-vous are all French terms fully understood to an Anglophone’s ear and in regular use. The French language is not being victimised by its speakers’ use of Franglais, it is a natural occurrence; as a result of shared Anglo-Franco history, the nations now adopt phraseology from each other’s language. No governmental measures can ever change or affect this natural linguistic activity and so political intervention on this issue is a waste of time.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>No; This is not entirely a mirror image of both languages influencing one another. English language influences in the French language –Franglais- are so prevalent due to the former being the language of computers, technology and the internet. The unstoppable rise of technology and the Internet communication age is only going to bring with it even more Anglophone influences on French and more and more Franglais. The Gallicisms used by Anglophones are older and established. They are not constantly coming thick and fast to invade the English language in the same way that English is the French one.

As Gaelic is spoken in the Highlands where the population is low it remains a rare language. If, like Welsh, it were spoken by a high population and used in the spheres of business and commerce in the main cities, it would have survived better. Franglais is similarly surviving due to necessity- it economises the effort of translating modern English terms that refer to technology, etc. into French and out of desire; the French clearly enjoy this playful fusion of their language with that of their historical rival.</p><p>If the French Government and Défense de la langue française seek to influence which words people may and may not use, this is censorship and is wholly wrong.</p>        </div>
