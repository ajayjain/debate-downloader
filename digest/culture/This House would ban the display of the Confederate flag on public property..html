    <h1 class="print-title">This House would ban the display of the Confederate flag on public property.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Between the years of 1861 and 1865, over 600,000 people were killed in the course of the American Civil War. The first truly industrial war, it was also the first conflict in history to involve such horrific innovations as trench warfare. It would be an oversimplification to attribute the war to any single cause, as various tensions separately and jointly served to move the states which would go on to form the Confederacy to secede. One such disagreement centered on the proper balance between &quot;slave states&quot; and &quot;free states&quot;. Equally significant were bitter conflicts of economic interest between agrarian Southern states and more industrial Northern states.</p>
<p>While the Confederacy possessed vastly more competent tacticians than the Union, the considerable logistical advantages enjoyed by the latter eventually proved decisive. However, though the integrity of the United States was preserved, many private individuals as well as public officials still elect to fly the Confederate battle flag. Whether this is done out of a harmless sense of regional pride or other, more sinister motives is open to question. Given the strong connotations of racial intolerance which the Confederate flag bears for so many, it is by no means a symbol to be taken lightly.</p>

                    <p>Displaying the Confederate flag is an invaluable means for Southerners to manifest their affection for their home. To constrain their ability to do so would be to undermine Southern culture to little end. It is for this reason that traditionalists perceive such efforts as little &quot;but profane efforts to deny the best qualities of Southern life... the battle over Confederate flags and monuments has become another front in the culture wars-nothing less than a struggle to halt the relentless march of modernity&#39;s homogenizing influences&quot;<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                    <p>Racial equality is far more important than regional pride. Though it is unfortunate that Southern heritage is inextricably bound up with the legacy of racism in America, the right of Southerners to manifest their local patriotism does not outweigh the right of Southern blacks to feel safe and respected in their own communities. According to a 2011 Pew Research Poll regarding contemporary American perspectives on the Civil War, &quot;38% of Americans say it was mainly about slavery...[and] far more African Americans than whites have a negative reaction to the Confederate flag (41% to 29%)&quot;. Though sentiments towards the Civil War and its symbols are hardly uniform, it cannot be denied that for millions, the Confederate flag represents nothing more or less than a social order founded on hatred and brutality.</p>

                    <p>The effects of a general ban on the public display of the Confederate flag would reach beyond those whom it is so plainly meant to intimidate. It would remove what amounts to a constant visual reinforcement of Old Southern racial doctrines and would consequently help to cultivate a more tolerant society. Empirical studies indicate that &quot;exposure to the Confederate ?ag led White participants to rate a hypothetical Black male character more negatively than those in the control condition. Participants&#39; racial attitudes failed to predict the degree to which ?ag exposure produced more negative evaluations. These ?ndings support the argument that exposure to the Confederate ?ag activates racially biased responding, by virtue of the ?ag&#39;s cultural associations with prejudice, and results in negatively biased judgments of Black people&quot;<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                    <p>Censoring an ideology merely heightens the resentment felt by its adherents. Banning the Confederate flag would do nothing to eradicate the root causes of racial prejudice, and would in fact be far more likely to exacerbate feelings of intolerance. Censorship of even the most vile rhetoric, however appealing a prospect, &quot;does not work because the repressed subject inevitably returns with more force just to spite the censor: it is hard to imagine a bigger boon to racism in America than an effort to ban private display of the Confederate battle flag.&quot;<sup>1</sup> Indeed, such proscription often serves only to reinforce &quot;paternalistic stereotypes about members of minority groups, suggesting that they need special protection from offensive speech.&quot;<sup>2</sup></p>

                    <p>Because the Confederate flag is almost invariably flown in communities affected by some degree of racial discord, its potency as a symbol of nostalgia for the racial hierarchy of the Old South is heightened. Were it to be flown in communities which enjoyed a pronounced racial harmony, the flag would be less likely to incite acts of hatred. However, when adjudicating the question of whether to allow such a display, &quot;the value of such expression should be balanced against the likelihood that it will cause harm. The risks are greater when hate propaganda incorporates symbolism&hellip;that demagogues have historically displayed to rally supporters to action&hellip; [states must use] historical records to identify symbolism that is likely to terrorize the populace and, therefore, detract from the common good&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                    <p>Such scenarios lend a connotation of bigotry to almost any act. In communities affected by racial disharmony, almost any symbol has the potential to take on a cultural significance effectively identical to that of the Confederate flag. It is not as though the flag was conceived as a means of demonstrating intolerance, or is primarily used as such today. Those who fly the Confederate colors do so merely as a means of expressing pride in their heritage. If that is an act of bigotry, then practically any tradition or icon which relates to the Old South must be treated likewise. Indeed, &quot;just as one can show an association between a symbol and racism, one could show a dissociation has occurred...a racist symbol could conceivably be &#39;cleansed&#39; of its racist quality by becoming commonplace, in much the same way prayers before legislative sessions have become ceremonial&quot;<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                    <p>Insofar as the Confederate flag is representative of a social order in which people of color are of comparable status to property, its display creates an untenable atmosphere of racial intolerance. Though the First Amendment is explicit in guaranteeing the right to free expression, hate speech which serves to promote violence towards a particular group or individual is acknowledged to fall outside the boundaries of Constitutional protection. Any interpretation which would seek to narrow the definition of hate speech to only encompass direct exhortations to violence &quot;fails to acknowledge that White supremacists&#39; racist ideology blames racial and ethnic minorities for all of society&#39;s ills. When demagogues and leaders of hate groups use racist and hateful propaganda, they are seeking followers whose attachment to the organization is premised on seeing members of outgroups as less than human. Once minorities are assumed to be subhuman, there is no longer any reason not to eliminate them by attacking them physically&quot;<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                    <p>Bigoted rhetoric should only be limited when it constitutes an immediate incitement to violence. Displaying the Confederate flag is an expressive act which contains numerous and varied meanings. Though it is plainly true that many associate the flag with notions of white supremacy, it could only be taken as an exhortation to violence in the most indirect sense. As noted in the 1969 Supreme Court case Brandenburg v. Ohio, &quot;the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy ...except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action&quot;. If such an inconsequential gesture as this is to be considered an act of incitement, then any number of seemingly innocuous speech acts must also lose their First Amendment protection, so long as they hold the bare potential to inspire violent sentiments in their audience. Indeed, as decided in the 1961 case Noto v. United States, even &quot;the teaching of the moral propriety or... moral necessity for a resort to force and violence, is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action&quot;.</p>

                    <p>Rather than banning the Confederate flag wholesale, the genuinely democratic response would be to allow or, perhaps, encourage a rhetorical response by those opposed to its display. Such counterspeech would lead to a deeper understanding of the issues underlying this symbol by all parties involved, and would be a much more effective means of bringing about reconciliation between the flag&#39;s supporters and opponents. As argued by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis in the 1927 case Whitney v. California, &quot;without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine... the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies; and the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones.</p>

                    <p>Bigotry exists precisely because of a refusal to engage in dialogue. A ban is the only means of responding to the flag, as the intolerant sentiments which motivate those who choose to display it are not founded on reason and are therefore not likely to change as a consequence of any amount of argument. Prejudice &quot;is irrational and often unconscious...belief in the inferiority of non-whites trumps good ideas that contend with it in the market, often without our even knowing it. In addition, racism makes the words and ideas of blacks and other despised minorities less saleable, regardless of their intrinsic value, in the marketplace of ideas&quot;<sup>1</sup>. If these individuals were willing to participate fully in the racial discourse, then they obviously would hold more refined views.</p>

                    <p>The right to free speech is an instrumental, rather than an intrinsic good. It does not derive its value from some abstract notion of expression for expression&#39;s own sake, but from the manner in which our First Amendment rights enable us to communicate our ideas to others in both private and public discourse. The Confederate flag possesses little, if any purpose save for the inflammation of lingering racial tensions. Furthermore, any sentiment which one could conceivably seek to express using the Confederate flag could be articulated in a much more constructive fashion through other means. There exist, as argued in the 1942 Supreme Court decision Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, &quot;certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which has never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem... It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality&quot;. To display the Confederate flag is no invitation to dialogue, but rather an act of intimidation this is not something the government should be endorsing by allowing the flag to be flown on public property.</p>

                    <p>Communicative value is an incredibly subjective criterion by which to determine the legal status of a speech act. Regardless of whether one perceives the Confederate flag to be a slap in the face to all those who remember the darker aspects of the Old South or a legitimate and innocuous means of expressing pride in one&#39;s heritage, its sanctity as a form of speech must be respected. Like any symbol, its communicative value is impossible to objectively judge, and is largely dependent on the viewer&#39;s own attitudes. Hence, to strip the flag of its Constitutional protections with the rationale that it is not a valid form of expression invites the closing of any number of other avenues of communication, particularly those which appeal to sentiment rather than rationality. Indeed, as explained in the 1971 Supreme Court decision Cohen v. California, &quot;much linguistic expression serves a dual communicative function: it conveys not only ideas capable of relatively precise, detached explication, but otherwise inexpressible emotions as well... which, practically speaking, may often be the more important element of the overall message sought to be communicated.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Though the sentiments bound up in the Confederate flag may be unpalatable to most, they remain firmly within the protection of the First Amendment. As argued in the 1989 Supreme Court decision Texas v. Johnson: &quot;If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable&quot;. All speech must be protected if any speech is to be free. Otherwise, the legality of a speech act falls to the personal preferences of the legislature and the judiciary.</p>

                    <p>The citizen&#39;s right to participate in the public discourse is sacred. To display the Confederate flag, a powerful symbol of intolerance, is to instil fear into already-marginalized minority groups, thereby limiting their ability to speak freely for fear of retribution. Some civility must be enforced if the civil discourse is to function, as &quot;it is not just the prevalence and strength of the idea of racism that make the unregulated marketplace of ideas an untenable paradigm for those individuals who seek full and equal personhood for all. The real problem is that the idea of the racial inferiority of nonwhites infects, skews, and disables the operation of a market&quot;<sup>1</sup>. Freedom of speech must be guaranteed in practice, not merely in principle. This can only be done through the restraint of bigoted rhetoric that prevents the other side having its freedom of speech.</p>
