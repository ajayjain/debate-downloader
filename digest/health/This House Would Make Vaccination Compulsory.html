    <h1 class="print-title">This House Would Make Vaccination Compulsory</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>In the United Kingdom, the percentage of children who have had already at least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination by their second birthdays was 88.2 % in 2009 – 2010. A much higher number than in 2008-2009 (84.9 %) or in 2003-2004 (79.9 %). The WHO (World Health Organization) suggests, that for a successful protection of the community 95 % of children need to have the jab.<a href="/print/17773#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Vaccines represent one of the most successful and effective interventions in medicine and a lucrative business opportunity for many pharmaceutical companies. By vaccinating people, society has been able to eradicate numerous diseases that caused millions of deaths before.</p><p>A dramatic example is smallpox, which was responsible for some of the most formidable epidemics of humankind. In 1967 it was the cause of 2 million deaths; a decade later it was totally eradicated from the planet by a concerted global vaccination program<a href="/print/17773#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Many countries have thus made it compulsory for people to be vaccinated against various diseases.</p><p>As of 2009 children in the US, Australia, Spain and Greece must have proof of vaccination before entering the public school system, although it is becoming easier in many states for parents to gain exemptions from this requirement. In the UK there is no such requirement (currently).<a href="/print/17773#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><p>Prior to a vaccine for polio, between 13,000 and 20,000 cases were reported in the USA annually. In 1988, the World Health Organization decided to try and eradicate polio worldwide with vaccination, and as of today, the disease has been removed from the USA, Western Pacific and Europe. Only four countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, India and Pakistan) are endemic, and there are just 2000 cases reported worldwide annually as of 2009.<a href="/print/17773#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p><p>But by stopping vaccination before the disease is widely eradicated leaves countries susceptible to future unexpected outbreaks. Another common disease – measles, affected nearly everyone in the United States prior to the vaccination being introduced. Between 1953 and 1963, there were 450 deaths each year from the disease. Currently in the US, three of every 1000 people who contract measles will die, whilst in the developing world, one in 100 will die. It is estimated that 90% of people who are exposed to the virus will get infected if not vaccinated against it. In 1999 according to the WHO, there were 900,000 measles related deaths worldwide. Measles can spread rapidly amongst unvaccinated populations, and if vaccinations were stopped, the WHO estimate there could be 2.7 million measles related deaths worldwide annually<a href="/print/17773#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>.</p><p>Type B meningitis was prior to the vaccine the most common form of bacterial meningitis in US infants, with 20,000 annual cases, with one in 600 proving either fatal or leaving the child with some form of disability. Since the vaccine became available in 1987, the number of cases has reduced by 98%, with fewer than ten fatalities a year.<a href="/print/17773#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> These are just a few examples of how vaccines can prevent and eradicate diseases that have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths throughout the past century. Although some may argue that with diseases such as Polio wiped out in most of the world a vaccine is not necessary. However any reduction in the number of people vaccinated against the disease would leave a window of opportunity for the disease to rear its head up once again.</p><p>Even though benefits are much greater if everyone is vaccinated than if not, some people choose not to be vaccinated, and have concerns about certain vaccines. Simultaneously the number of people vaccinated rose as did the movements against the notion of compulsory vaccination, such as the society of Anti Vaccinations (1798) and the Anti- Vaccination League (1853).</p><p>There should be as few obstacles as possible to such a program in order to save as many lives as possible. Some might argue that, that the government should not be able to force someone to have a needle stuck into them? They might also say that if they wish to take the risk of not having the vaccine that is their choice. However many claim, that because the risks do not just affect them, but the people around them, people should not be allowed to choose vaccines on their own. &nbsp;So, this essentially this debate boils down to personal liberty vs. the good of the entire society.</p><div><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Jane Kirby, More Children Having MMR vaccine, 11/30/2010, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/nov/30/children-mmr-vaccination-increase">http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/nov/30/children-mmr-vaccination-increase</a>, accessed 05/25/2011<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Smallpox.

                    <p>If an age group is protected, that results in a better health conditions for the whole society.</p><p>In an industrialized country such as the USA, those choosing exemption from statutorily compulsory vaccination were 35-times more likely to contract measles than vaccinated persons; in developing countries where these viruses are still endemic, the risk would be considerably higher<a href="/print/17773#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p><p>Those who wish to opt-out of vaccination (often on behalf of their children, who have no say in the matter) are classic free riders, hoping to benefit from the more responsible behavior of the rest of society. As it is assumed that most of society see it as a responsibility and a duty to protect others.</p><p>After a scare about possible side effects of the MMR jab, in 2008 there was a drop in voluntary vaccinations in a part of London (Lewisham). In that part of London only 64.3 % of children were vaccine and in that year the district accounted one third of all south-east London measles cases. Unless there is a 95 % vaccination, there is a great threat to public health of infection outbreaks.<a href="/print/17773#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> It is therefore the role of the state to understand these issues and possible treats and provide a duty of protection and care, in this case, in the form of immunization.</p><p>Another example of the need to protect is also given by the example of voluntary vaccination against the flu, because of its impacts on the whole population is given by Pediatric studies: ”In several studies, results indicated that a 100% vaccination rate among health care personnel in acute care settings triggered a 43% decline in risk of influenza among patients. This decrease appeared even higher — 60% — among nursing home patients.”<a href="/print/17773#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So by giving up some of the individuals freedoms and the feeling of duty to protection, the community is much more protected and benefits from the vaccination of the community.</p><div><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Vaccination Critics &amp; Opponents. <a href="http://www.neurodiversity.com/anti_vaccination.html">http://www.neurodiversity.com/anti_vaccination.html</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> BBC News, Experts warn of measles outbreaks, 03/18/2008&nbsp; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7291248.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7291248.stm</a>, accessed 05/25/2011</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/656558" target="_new">Talbot TR.&nbsp;<cite>Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol., </cite>Two medical societies back mandatory flu vaccination for health care workers</a>, published 2010, <a href="http://www.pediatricsupersite.com/view.aspx?rid=68173">http://www.pediatricsupersite.com/view.aspx?rid=68173</a>, accessed 05/27/2011</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>A great deal of health care and prevention of diseases is information and an informed decision. The United Kingdom does not have a system of compulsory health care, but disease outbreaks are still prevented due to the voluntary uptake of immunizations. The pediatrician Miriam Fine-Goulden explains: “The risk of contracting these infections is only so low at present because the voluntary uptake of immunizations has been high enough (in most cases) to reduce the chance of contact with those organisms through the process of herd immunity.”<a href="/print/17773#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Also it can be argued that measles, mumps and rubella (one of the diseases vaccine against) are far from harmful. They are relatively minor illnesses<a href="/print/17773#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Measles causes a rash and high fever. Mumps causes swollen glands, headache and fever. Rubella is usually mild and can go unnoticed.</p><p>Just because medical advance has been made in vaccinations it does not mean that we have to be immunized against every little disease known to man. Bearing in mind the cost of such jabs on the heavily burdened NHS, surely it would be better to not make the MMR jab compulsory. This way we keep parents happy and the NHS budget can be stretched further.</p><p>Researches also show that alternative approaches towards diseases such as better nutrition, homeopathy, etc. give very positive results. Healthier populations would not need vaccines to fight a disease. High profits that are now reserved only for the pharmaceutical industry would be spread to other areas of the economy, such as agriculture and the service sector, and more people would gain.</p><div><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Miriam Fine-Goulden: Should childhood vaccinations be compulsory in the UK ?, University College London,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/opticon1826/archive/issue8/articles/Article_Biomed_Sc_-_Fine-Goulden__Vaccination_Publish.pdf">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/opticon1826/archive/issue8/articles/Article_Biomed_Sc_-_Fine-Goulden__Vaccination_Publish.pdf</a>, accessed 05/29/2011<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> BBC News, Should the MMR vaccine be compulsory, 03/02/2002,&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/2088426.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/2088426.stm</a>, accessed 05/29/2011</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Compulsory vaccination is an example of the tyranny of the majority even if it is made by a democratic government. And in a community that praises itself as democratic and respectful to wishes of others it is in no way acceptable that the rights of some get abused by the wishes of others.&nbsp;</p><p>John Stuart Mill has set philosophical basics: “the majority… the people, consequently, may desire to oppress a part of their number; and precautions are as much needed against this, as against any other abuse of power… In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute.

If it is more based upon public harm i.e. the more chance of the virus infecting from one human to another then the less this defense can be used.<a href="/print/17773#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Mill, John Stuart.

                    <p>Commonly-used vaccines are a cost-effective and preventive way of promoting health, compared to the treatment of acute or chronic disease. In the U.S. during the year 2001, routine childhood immunizations against seven diseases were estimated to save over $40 billion per birth-year cohort in overall social costs including $10 billion in direct health costs, and the societal benefit-cost ratio for these vaccinations was estimated to be 16.5 billion.<a href="/print/17773#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Another aspect is also, that productivity rates remain high and less money is earmarked for social and health transfers because people are healthier.

This equates to an increase in annual earnings per child of $14 by 2020. The total increase in income per year once the vaccinated cohort of children start earning will rise from $410 million in 2005 to $1.34 billion by 2020 (at a cost of $638 million in 2005 and $748 million in 2020).”<a href="/print/17773#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This study based on economic and health indicators is part of the world immunization program GAVI.</p><div><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Wikipedia.

In addition to these upfront costs, organizing compulsory vaccination programs across an entire country can be very complicated and expensive.

                    <p>In most countries and declarations, one of the most basic human rights is the one to bodily integrity. It sets down that you have a right not to have your body or person interfered with. This means that the State may not do anything to harm your body without consent.</p><p>The NHS (National Health Service) explains: “You must give your consent (permission) before you receive any type of medical treatment, from a simple blood test to deciding to donate your organs after your death. If you refuse a treatment, your decision must be respected.”</p><p>This comes from the principle, that if a person has the capacity to consent to treatment and is making an informed decision (based on pros and cons of the treatment), the decision must be respected. The NHS explains further on: “If you have enough capacity and make a voluntary and informed decision to refuse a treatment, your decision must be respected. This applies even if your decision would result in your death, or the death of your unborn child.”<a href="/print/17773#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>In the case of vaccination this principle should be also applied. Even though we recognize that children are not able to fully comprehend the consequences a refusal would have, the parents should be there to decide on behalf of children over such decisions. The state has no right to stick a needle into a child just because they see fit doing so. It might be contested that in case of life endangering illnesses, the state should override the individuals’ rights. But rejection of vaccinations is not life endangering. So it is the judgment of the individual that is important and should not under any case be violated, just because someone might get an illness that in today’s modern world is easily curable.&nbsp;</p><div><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> National Health Service (NHS), Do I have a right to refuse treatment ?, <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/899.aspx?categoryid=68&amp;subcategoryid=156">http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/899.aspx?categoryid=68&amp;subcategoryid=156</a>, accessed 29/05/2011</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Through birth, the child and the parent have a binding agreement that is supported within the society. This agreement involves a set of rights and duties aimed at, and justified by, the welfare of the child. Through that (according to texts from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy): parents owe their children an “open future,” understood as one where they become adults capable of choosing their own conception of the good. As custodian, the parent is under a limited obligation to work and organize his or her life around the welfare and development of the child, for the child's sake. Concomitantly, the parent is endowed with a special kind of authority over the child.<a href="/print/17773#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>It therefore is the courtesy of a parent to decide what the best possible outcome is for a child. If the parent believes the child will be safer and better off in society without being given vaccine it is the parent’s right to decide not to give vaccination to the child.</p><p>Also the American Academy of Pediatrics reports, that refusing the immunization might not put children at risk, as long as they live in a well immunized community and can benefit from the “herd immunity”. They state: “Even in a community with high immunization rates, the risk assumed by an unimmunized child is likely to be greater than the risks associated with immunization. However, the risk remains low, and in most cases the parent who refuses immunizations on behalf of his or her child living in a well-immunized community does not place the child at substantial risk of serious harm.”<a href="/print/17773#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parenthood/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parenthood/</a>, accessed 05/28/2011<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Diekema Douglas, Responding to Parental Refusals of Immunization of Children, <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/115/5/1428.full">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/115/5/1428.full</a>, accessed 05/28/2011</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>An adult vaccine refusal and a parental vaccine refusal are not the same.

For instance: in order to promote culturally prescribed norms, parents may seek to remove their child from school, or have their daughter undergo clitoridectomy; yet the state may claim that such a decision violates the parents' trustee relationship on grounds that the state has a compelling interest in securing the full citizenship capacities and rights of each of its citizens. As trustee, the parent has a limited right to exclusivity in determining the child's life over the course of childhood, but this determination is to be aimed at shaping the child into (for instance) a productive citizen and community member. <a href="/print/17773#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>The LSU Law center also explains: “The more difficult problem is religious or cultural groups that oppose immunizations. These groups tend to cluster, reducing the effective immunization level in their neighborhoods, schools, and churches. In addition to endangering their own children, such groups pose a substantial risk to the larger community. By providing a reservoir of infection, a cluster of unimmunized persons can defeat the general herd immunity of a community.

                    <p>Some of the used vaccines may have severe side effects, therefore we should let every individual asses the risk and make choices on his/her own. Besides introducing foreign proteins and even live viruses into the bloodstream, each vaccine has its own preservative, neutralizer and carrying agent, none of which are indigenous to the body. For instance, the triple antigen, DPT, which includes Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus vaccine, contains the following poisons: Formaldehyde, Mercury, and aluminum phosphate, and that's from the Physician's Desk Reference, 1980. The packet insert accompanying the vaccine, lists the following poisons: aluminum potassium sulfate, a mercury derivative called Thimersol and sodium phosphate. The packet insert for the polio vaccine lists monkey kidney cell culture, lactalbumin hydrozylate, antibiotics and calf serum. The packet insert for the MMR vaccine produced by Merck Sharp and Dhome which is for measles, mumps and rubella lists chick embryo and neomycin, which is a mixture of antibiotics.<a href="/print/17773#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Evidence also suggests that immunizations damage the immune system itself. By focusing exclusively on increased antibody production, which is only one aspect of the immune process, immunizations isolate dysfunction and allow it to substitute for the entire immune response, because vaccines trick the body so that it will no longer initiate a generalized response. They accomplished what the entire immune system seems to have been evolved to prevent. That is, they place the virus directly into the blood and give it access to the major immune organs and tissues without any obvious way of getting rid of it.</p><p>The long-term persistence of viruses and other foreign proteins within the cells of the immune system has been implicated in a number of chronic and degenerative diseases. In 1976 Dr. Robert Simpson of Rutgers university addressed science writers at a seminar of the American Cancer Society, and pointed out the following. "Immunization programs against flu, measles, mumps, polio and so forth may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form latent pro viruses in cells throughout the body. These latent pro viruses could be molecules in search of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, Parkinson's disease, and perhaps cancer."<a href="/print/17773#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>Vaccines may cause a child who is genetically predisposed to have autism. If the trend of increased Thimerosal in vaccinations correlates so well with the trend of increased autistic diagnoses, there is a link. Thimerosal in vaccinations (which means 'contains mercury') causes autism. Too many times has a child been completely healthy, and then a vaccine containing Thimerosal is injected into the child. The child becomes ill, stops responding visually and verbally, and is then diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p><div><a href="/print/17773#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Roger R.

Samples were analyzed in three laboratories blinded to diagnosis, including one wherein the original findings suggesting a link between measles virus and autism had been reported. <a href="/print/17773#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>"Our results are inconsistent with a causal role for MMR vaccine as a trigger or exacerbate of either GI difficulties or autism," states Mady Hornig, associate professor of Epidemiology and director of translational research in the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Mailman School, and co-corresponding author of the study. "The work reported here eliminates the remaining support for the hypothesis that autism with GI complaints is related to MMR vaccine exposure. We found no relationship between the timing of MMR vaccine and the onset of either GI complaints or autism.<a href="/print/17773#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>Many parents came to believe that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.livescience.com/2619-evolution-vaccines-fear.html">vaccines</a>&nbsp;caused their children's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.livescience.com/2418-autism-mystery.html">autism</a>&nbsp;because the symptoms of autism appeared after the child received a vaccination. On a psychological level, that assumption and connection makes sense; but on a logical level, it is a clear and common fallacy with a fancy Latin name:&nbsp;<em>post hoc ergo propter hoc</em>&nbsp;("after this, therefore because of it").
