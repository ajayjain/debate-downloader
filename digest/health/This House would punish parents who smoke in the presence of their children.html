    <div class="print-content"><p>In many countries, laws now exist which prevent people from smoking in public places, so that non-smokers can avoid breathing in secondhand smoke.<a href="/print/17713#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Those who want a law preventing parents from smoking around their children (and punishing them if they do) see it as a natural and important next step; if we don&rsquo;t let people smoke in public because they might endanger the lives of non-smokers around them, then it seems logical &ndash; say those in favour &ndash; to also have a law stopping parents from potentially harming their children through smoking in the home environment. &nbsp;Research has shown that second hand smoke is very bad for children&rsquo;s health, and this is now widely accepted. &nbsp;Some medical experts believe it may be more dangerous than actual smoking because of the larger amount of cancer-causing chemicals in this type of smoke. &nbsp;It can be especially harmful to babies and young children who are in the early stages of their physical development. It may lead to less developed lungs and a series of respiratory (breathing) illnesses such as bronchitis, asthma and even heart conditions. &nbsp;Those in favour of this law see punishment (by escalating fines or maybe even imprisonment) as the best way to discourage parents from smoking around their children.</p>

                    <p>Tobacco is legal.&nbsp; Smoking is legal.&nbsp; The state encroaches on basic freedoms when it punishes legal conduct for ulterior motives. &nbsp;Would the same logic justify punishing parents who drink alcohol in front of their children, because the inconvenience might reduce drinking among parents?&nbsp; Also, the desired indirect effect of punishing parents who smoke in front of their children may not be achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other studies in England have shown that while the number of smokers trying to quit did increase shortly after the ban (on smoking in public places) was introduced there, numbers steadied again soon after that.<a href="/print/17713#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp;While the ban might have led to some people quitting at the beginning, many others continued to smoke despite the new law, obviously just finding somewhere else to do it. This shows that most smokers will just find a different way to continue their habit. &nbsp;This could have detrimental effects in the case of punishing parents who smoke around their children, since those parents might leave their children alone in the house while they go somewhere else to smoke, which is potentially dangerous. &nbsp;Instead of risking a scenario where children are periodically left alone during parental “smoke breaks”, parents should just be trusted to live their lives responsibly. &nbsp;It is unnecessary to bring in a legislation that would just inconvenience so many people.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17713#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Grens, “Smokers quit after ban, but numbers ebb: study.” 2011. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/06/us-cigarettes-idUSTRE7552S620110606">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/06/us-cigarettes-idUSTRE7552S620110606</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
