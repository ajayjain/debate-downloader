    <h1 class="print-title">This House would only teach abstinence for sex education in schools</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The debate between &quot;comprehensive sex education&quot; (also just called &quot;sex education&quot;) and &quot;abstinence-only education&quot; is long-standing in the United States, and exists in many other societies around the world that are split between more sexually progressive groups and those that generally oppose pre-marital sex. Comprehensive sex education programs, at least in the United States, generally emphasise that abstaining from sex is the safest way to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. However, comprehensive programs differ from abstinence-only programs in that they also encourage the use of condoms or other forms of contraception. &nbsp;&nbsp;Abstinence-only programs are much more conservative and limited in scope, teaching abstinence from sex, usually until marriage, as a means of avoiding the risk of pregnancy and STDs and of enjoying other considered benefits such as a more unique sexual bond with one&#39;s ultimate partner.</p>
<p>When constructing affirmative and negative cases, debaters should consider the wide range of perspectives from which these issues can be understood. This debate brings together many fields of study, including sexual culture, marital culture, faith, human instincts, pregnancy, disease, and parental-school-state roles. Debaters should also be clear exactly what they are arguing for. Although abstinence-only programs are generally thought of as quite conservative, this need not prevent an affirmative team including the discussion of STIs and their effects as part of these programs. Opposition side teams should be prepared to discuss the social and value-led implications of teaching children about the threat of STIs in order to deter them from engaging in pre-marital sex.</p>
<p>Affirmative debaters should be prepared for Negative debaters who attempt to argue that the affirmative team should advocate fairly traditional abstinence-programs, and cannot design a program so liberal as to be nearly identical to sex-ed programs.</p>
<p>Debaters should also consider what age group they are discussing: the arguments for abstinence-only with young children may be substantially different than those with older teenagers. Given that the resolution does not specify the age range, it is up to the Affirmative to either defend abstinence-only in general in primary and secondary schools, or to provide solid justification for limiting the debate.</p>

By leaving out discussions of sex, it reassures teenagers that they do not need to think or worry about sex until they are older, and avoids giving the impression that sex is an important or relevant topic for children.&nbsp;</p><div><a href="/print/17677#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2002/04/the-effectiveness-of-abstinence-education-programs.">Rector, Robert.

                    <p>There is little evidence that abstention-only programs delay the initiation of sex. A range of studies have demonstrated that they do not delay the onset of sexual activity or reduce the frequency with which sex occurs once a teenager has become sexually active.</p><p>Unglamorous sex-ed does not encourage teenagers to have sex, nor need it exclude information on ways to be non-sexually intimate. Teenagers uninterested in sex are unlikely to become interested as the result of classes on such topics as STIs and methods of protection. On the other hand, many teenagers <em>are</em> thinking about sex, and so educating about prevention of STIs and pregnancy is important (and even may discourage some teens from having sex once they understand the risks and responsibilities that come with it). Furthermore, if teen culture truly is becoming increasingly sexualized, then a scientific and objective sex-ed class may be the best way to ensure that students do not feel pressured into sexual relationships. Given that young people today have lots of exposure to unregulated sexual content (for example on TV), we ought to ensure that they have at least one reliable, informative source about the physical and emotional effects of having sex. Information, not ignorance, will allow them to make the best choices.</p>        </div>

All sex – even protected – has the possibility of leading to STIs or pregnancy, both of which have huge psychological, emotional, and physical impacts.

                    <p>Abstinence is obviously the most effective form of birth control and protection from STIs, but telling students to practice abstinence does not mean that they will. Abstinence should absolutely be emphasized as an important method of staying safe, but teaching it alongside other information about sex and protection is far more responsible than pretending that these things do not exist. Even if young people <em>shouldn’t</em> be having sex (which is not necessarily true), many clearly are (slightly under half of high school students have had sex according to the Kaiser Family Foundation).<a href="/print/17677#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Consequently, it is better to a) ensure that they have adequate knowledge to stay safe and b) view their teachers as honest and informative, so that they trust their advice and do not simply reject the class as moralizing or irrelevant.</p><div><a href="/print/17677#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.kff.org/youthhivstds/upload/U-S-Teen-Sexual-Activity-Fact-Sheet.pdf">Kaiser Family Foundation. “U.S. Teen Sexual Activity Fact Sheet.” The Henry J.

The federally funded study found that only about a third of 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> graders receiving abstinence-only education had sex over the following two years, whereas nearly half of 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> graders attending other classes became sexually active.<a href="/print/17677#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> And, abstinence-only education did not affect condom usage<a href="/print/17677#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> <u>)</u> (confirming what the Mathematica Policy Research study cited by the Opposition also found!<a href="/print/17677#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>).

                    <p>Given that cultural and social attitudes towards sex are so variable, it should be up to the family to decide how to broach this sensitive topic. Schools are supposed to give students the skills and knowledge they need for employment and/or higher education: sex education is a separate, much more personal, issue. Telling students to abstain ensures that no one is taught anything more than their parents want, and leaves room for parents to give a more extensive education if they so desire. This is especially true since most parents support abstinence education anyway: A Zogby International poll of U.S. parents found that 78% of parents think sex education classes in public schools should place more emphasis on promoting abstinence than on condom and other contraceptive use.<a href="/print/17677#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17677#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.abstinenceassociation.org/docs/zogby_questionnaire_050207.pdf">Zogby International. “Survey of Nationwide Parents of Children Age 10-16.” Zobgy International. 27 March 2007.</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>First, to clarify, while the poll found that 78% of parents think sex education classes should place more emphasis on abstinence, it also found that more parents would rather their children were enrolled in comprehensive sex education courses than in abstinence education courses.<a href="/print/17677#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> But more importantly, the problem with relying on parents to teach their children essential sexual information is that many children do not have parents, or responsible ones. These children need a holistic education more than anyone, and it is unfair to prevent them from learning about sex just because they have no one willing to talk to them about it. Furthermore, schools are meant to prepare students not only academically, but also socially: sending students into the world with no knowledge about sex is irresponsible both to the students, who are may be unprepared for a very large part of their lives, and to society, which must deal with an uneducated and consequently at-risk population. Cultural attitudes aside, there are some medical facts students need to know.

If two consenting individuals wish to have sex, and feel that they would be made happier by the experience, there is no reason to deny them that right. Furthermore, so long as individuals use protection and get tested for STIs (both measures that sex-ed encourages) they should not be significantly more at-risk than committed couples.</p><p>Teaching abstinence to an individual does nothing to alter the possibility that his or her future sexual partners will have been more promiscuous. Even if that individual is monogamous if their partner is not then their situation may be little better than if they had been polygamous themselves. This means that abstinent individuals are still at risk of contracting an STI – and that perception of that risk may be understated or distorted by abstinence-only sex education.</p><p>Finally, marriage is a social and cultural institution not shared by all. Just because the Bible preaches no sex before marriage, and just because some people wish to save sex for marriage, does not mean that all people either think that extra-marital sex is wrong, or intend on getting married at all. It is offensive to suggest that sex out of marriage is necessarily damaging, as some abstinence programs are required to do.<a href="/print/17677#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It is also impractical, because most young people (about 95% in the United States) do have sex prior to marriage.</p><div><a href="/print/17677#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm">Social Security Online. “Separate Program for Abstinence Education Sec. 510 [42 U.S.C. 710].

                    <p>Teenage pregnancy rates have declined in recent years, and supporters of an abstinence-only approach sometimes use this trend to defend their programs. However, according to a paper in The American Journal of Public Health, 86 percent of the decline in teenage pregnancy can be attributed to more widespread-- and more effective-- contraceptive use, and only 14 percent to teenagers’ choosing to stay abstinent longer.<a href="/print/17677#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a><u>)</u> This is not simply about using condoms: it is about using condoms <em>properly. </em>Incorrect use of condoms can make them extremely ineffective at preventing STDs and pregnancy.<a href="/print/17677#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The implication is that even if young people in abstinence-programs still report using condoms, they are probably less likely to use them correctly since they are not taught how.

Students need to be aware of the physical, psychological and emotional implications of having sex in order to make informed decisions, but abstinence-only does not give them this information. If the only thing that students know about sex is that they 'should not have it,' there is no way they can actually make educated choices about whether or not to be abstinent.
