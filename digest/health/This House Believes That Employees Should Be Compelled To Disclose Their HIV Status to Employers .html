    <div class="print-content"><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in people, a condition in which the patient’s immune system is progressively compromised until it is unable to combat opportunistic infections and cancers.&nbsp; HIV progresses to AIDS at a very variable rate that depends upon the health of the patient but on average takes around 10 years. A person with AIDS will only survive for about a year without treatment, but in a Western state with access to the latest treatments life expectancy can be raised to several decades.&nbsp; Like all viruses HIV is incurable and it has proven difficult to develop a vaccine.&nbsp; The main routes of HIV infection are through blood transfusions (largely eliminated in the developed world by screening), unsafe sex, contaminated needles and mother-to-daughter transmission either in the womb or though breast milk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HIV is therefore a disease which is very difficult to transmit, yet at the same time extremely lethal.&nbsp; It’s been estimated that AIDS killed 25 million people between 1981 and 2005, making it one of the most destructive pandemics in recorded history.&nbsp; Even in the developed world, HIV infection is a life changing event that will require the patient to carefully adjust many aspects of their life.&nbsp; They will have to participate in a rigorous anti-viral treatment regime that requires taking drugs several times a day.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An employer may (depending on the circumstances) have serious concerns about the HIV status of his employees given the possible risks to themselves, to other employees, and to their future within the business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

They will have to make provision for possible sickness cover and replacement workers, potentially for medical and/or retirement costs. HIV can make people tired and can lead to being sick more often as it means the immune system will not be able to fight off infections as well as it normally would.<a href="/print/17975#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The employee’s productivity might be reduced to the point at which their continued employment is no longer viable. If things are made difficult for employers with HIV positive workers, then they are less likely in the future to employ people who (they suspect) are HIV positive. Employers must be listened to in this debate – in many HIV-stricken countries, they’re the last thing between a semi-functioning society and complete economic and social collapse. Traditional rights ideas such as concerns about privacy of medical records are less important than the benefit to society of being able to cope with the unique problem of HIV more effectively.</p><div><br clear="all"><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17975#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Dickens, Carol, ‘Signs of HIV, AIDS symptoms’, AIDS Symptoms, <a href="http://www.aidssymptoms.org/Diagnosis/hiv-signs.html">http://www.aidssymptoms.org/Diagnosis/hiv-signs.html</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

The possibility of transmission, while very unlikely, is real and one they have a right to know about so as to be able to guard against it. While most of the time it will not be problem as transmission requires a transfer of bodily fluids this may occasionally happen in a workplace.<a href="/print/17975#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This is particularly true of healthworkers (e.g. doctors, nurses, dentists, midwives, paramedics, etc) who should have both a moral and a legal obligation to disclose if they are HIV-positive.

                    <p>Working with someone with HIV does not put you at risk. Suggesting that it does serves to perpetuate the myths that do such harm to HIV-positive people who already suffer too much. To clarify: AIDS cannot be transmitted through external, intact skin. It cannot pass through the air like cold germs. Sweat, urine, tears and saliva cannot transmit HIV. Whilst blood, seminal fluid, vaginal fluid and breast milk can, how often are such fluids encountered at work? Even if they are, and such fluids are HIV positive, they must enter another’s body through mucus membranes, directly into the bloodstream (e.g. via injection), or from mother to child via breastfeeding or in the womb. What workplaces risk such transferral?</p>        </div>

                    <p>Businesses ought to take a responsible and active position on HIV. The issue isn’t going to go away. Successful programs designed to help HIV-positive employees remain in the workplace for as long as they want to do so should be developed. Procedures for treating personnel with fairness and dignity must be put in place. The potential fears and prejudices of other employees must be combated. The beginning of that process is ensuring they know about the problem and, crucially, the scale of it. Without knowledge of the numbers involved, employers may put in place inadequate medical and pensions arrangements that will ultimately prove inadequate.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Employers have no right to know. This is an arena into which the state has no right to intrude, or to compel intrusion by others.

If employers find out, they might dismiss workers – which is exactly why many employees don’t want to tell them.</p><p><br>If workers are forced to disclose the fact that they have HIV, the merit principle will go out the window. Even if not dismissed, their prospects for promotion will be shattered – because of prejudice, or the perception that their career has in any meaningful sense been ‘finished’ by their condition (which is often not the case as sufferers can work and lead fulfilling lives after diagnosis; life expectancy after diagnosis in the US was 22.5 years in 2005<a href="/print/17975#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>).</p><p><br>Even if not fired and career advancement doesn’t suffer, prejudice from co-workers is likely.

                    <p>This measure could be actively dangerous for HIV-positive workers. Ignorance causes so much bad behaviour towards AIDS sufferers and HIV-positive men and women. A fifth of men in the UK who disclose their HIV positive status at work then experience HIV discrimination.<a href="/print/17975#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp;The proposition seeks to institutionalise and widen the shunning and ill-treatment of HIV-positive workers that already happens when people find out about their condition. Even if not motivated by prejudice, co-workers will often take excessive precautions which are medically unnecessary and inflame unsubstantiated fears of casual transmission.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In addition, many people who are HIV-positive choose not to reveal their condition for fear of violent reactions to them from their families and the rest of society. If disclosure to an employer is compulsory, then the news will inevitably leak out to the wider community.

                    <p>Employers can be trusted to use this information responsibly. They are already used to keeping sensitive information (e.g. about salaries, annual reports, or employees' addresses and telephone numbers) confidential. Nor is it in their interest to open themselves up to lawsuits for bullying and discrimination in the workplace. There is no reason to assume that businesses will be more likely to leak information about someone's HIV status than doctors or hospitals, who already have such information.</p>        </div>
