    <h1 class="print-title">This House would ban partial birth abortions</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>This issue is about late-term abortions, in the second and third trimesters. At least 90% of abortions are performed in the first trimester, when other procedures are more appropriate. In partial-birth abortion (PBA), also known as Dilation and Extraction (D&amp;X), the woman's cervix is dilated, and the foetus is partially removed from the womb, feet first. The surgeon inserts a sharp object into the back of the foetus' head, removes it, and inserts a vacuum tube through which the brain is extracted. The head of the foetus contracts at this point and allows the foetus to be more easily removed from the womb. <a href="/print/17900#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The main justifications for the use of D&amp;X are: that the foetus is dead; that continued pregnancy will endanger the life of the mother; that continued pregnancy will adversely affect the mother’s health; that the foetus is so malformed that it will never gain consciousness after birth. More controversial is the use of the technique for healthy foetuses when the mother’s life is not at risk. This is banned by several state Medical Associations in the US, but many physicians have reported performing them, mainly for women who are suicidally depressed, but also for rape victims and for very young pregnant women.</p><p>It is estimated that about 3,000 partial-birth abortions were performed per year in the United States in the 1990s<a href="/print/17900#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> (though this represents around 0.2% of the total number of abortions).<a href="/print/17900#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Bill Clinton vetoed bills banning partial-birth abortions in 1995, 1997 and 1999. George W. Bush signed a partial-birth abortion ban into law in 2003, and this was found constitutional in 2007 by the US Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood Federation of America v. Gonzales<a href="/print/17900#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> (largely reversing the Court's decision in a 2000 case on state law)<a href="/print/17900#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>. Although this is not necessarily a US-specific debate, the issue is on the political agenda in the USA to an extent which is not matched elsewhere, and some of the arguments here reflect this.&nbsp;</p><p>In running this debate (and with all other abortion debates) it is necessary to consider whether or not an exception will be made for medical necessity.</p><p>NB In addition to the arguments below, this debate may well employ arguments from debates about abortion in general – consult the entry for ���Abortion’ in debatabase, and the materials linked to from there.</p><div><br clear="all"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17900#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> The Harriet and Robert Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health, ‘Abortion’, <em>Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health</em>, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/pubhealth/modules/reproductiveHealth/abortion.html">http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/pubhealth/modules/reproductiveHealth/abortion.html</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17900#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Alabama Policy institute, ‘Partial-Birth Abortions’, 2007 <a href="http://alabamapolicy.org/issues/gti/issue.php?issueID=253&amp;guideMainID=8">http://alabamapolicy.org/issues/gti/issue.php?issueID=253&amp;guideMainID=8</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17900#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Finer and Henshaw, ‘Abortion Incidence and Serevices in the United States in 2000’, <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3500603.html">http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3500603.html</a></p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17900#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> Supreme Court of the United States, Gonzales, Attorney General v.

                    <p>Partial-birth abortion is disgusting. Like all abortions, it involves the killing of an unborn child, but unlike first trimester abortions there is no doubt that the foetus can feel pain by the third trimester.<a href="/print/17900#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The procedure involves sticking a pair of scissors into a baby’s brain, enlarging the hole, sucking the brain out with a catheter and then crushing the skull. It is entirely unacceptable to do this to a living human being. Psychological damage to the mother as a result of rape or teenage pregnancy or depression is in the end less significant than the physical damage - death - caused to the child.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17900#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Lee, Susan J., et al., ‘Fetal Pain, A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence’, <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>, Vol 294 (8), 2005,&nbsp; <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/294/8/947.short">http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/294/8/947.short</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Nobody would choose to have a partial-birth abortion over a much simpler abortion in the first trimester. Partial-birth abortions are either medically or psychologically necessary. If a young mother either does not find out she is pregnant or is too scared to tell anyone, if a woman is raped and decides at any stage that she does not want the baby, if a woman is threatening suicide if she is forced to carry a baby to term, we should not make her suffer further by forbidding her from ending the pregnancy. For all sorts of reasons, many women do not seek any kind of medical help until late in their pregnancy - this should not mean they forfeit their right to an abortion. In any case, if abortion is allowed at all, and given that the foetus is not recognised in law as a human being, it should be nobody’s business but the mother’s whether and at what stage she chooses to have an abortion.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Tragically, some babies are unwanted, but this does not mean that we should kill them. There are plenty of other options, notably adoption. If anything, the case for adoption is more compelling in the third trimester, because the pregnancy is nearer to its natural end and there is less time, only about ten weeks, for the mother to have to put up with it.<a href="/print/17900#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Unwanted pregnancy and adoption may be psychologically harmful, but in many cases so is abortion, particularly at a late stage of pregnancy when the mother can see that the dead foetus is recognisably a baby - the guilt feelings associated with feeling that one is responsible for murdering a child can be unbearable.</p><div><br clear="all"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17900#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Bupa, ‘Stages of pregnancy���, April 2010, <a href="http://www.bupa.co.uk/individuals/health-information/directory/s/pregnancy-what-happens-stages#textBlock190283">http://www.bupa.co.uk/individuals/health-information/directory/s/pregnancy-what-happens-stages#textBlock190283</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Arguing that adoption is a good option shows a fundamental lack of awareness of what is involved in carrying an unwanted foetus to term. Pregnancy can be stressful at the best of times; being forced to carry an unwanted child against your will is enormously traumatic, and can cause permanent psychological harm, as can the knowledge that your own unwanted child is growing up elsewhere and may one day return to find you. If a mother chooses to carry a foetus to term and then give it up for adoption, that’s fine, but nobody should force her to do so.</p>        </div>

                    <p>These opinion polls are misleading, as they force respondents to choose between an outright ban and no control at all – it is impossible for them to register support for partial-birth abortion in cases where the mother’s physical or psychological health is in danger. A majority of Americans are still in favour of the right to abortion. More importantly, this should not be the business of the general public or of legislators. Nobody who would prefer not to have a partial-birth abortion will be made to have one. Most people who want it banned will never face a situation where it directly affects them in any case. We should leave decisions up to the people who are directly affected by them - not to outsiders, who are free to express their opinion but not to impose it on everyone else. This is a campaign promise George Bush should not keep.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The culture of foetal rights reflects a dangerous litigious trend in American society, and implies a view of pregnant women as being nothing more than baby-carrying machines whose independence and autonomy should be restricted and whose motivations should be questioned at every turn. If this has implications for the abortion debate, then those implications are profoundly damaging to women in general. In any case, the mother of a wanted baby has entirely different responsibilities toward the unborn foetus from the mother of an unwanted baby - that’s why our society allows both abortions and antenatal classes.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Allowing partial-birth abortion is utterly inconsistent with the growing, and legally recognised, respect for foetal rights in the United States.

                    <p>Partial-birth abortions form a tiny proportion of all abortions, but from a medical and psychological point of view they ought to be the least controversial. The reason for this focus is that late-term abortions are the most obviously distasteful, because late-term foetuses look more like babies than embryos or foetuses at an earlier developmental stage. Late-term abortions therefore make for the best pro-life campaigning material. By attempting to focus the debate here, campaigners are aiming to conflate all abortions with late-term abortions, and to increase opposition to all abortion on that basis.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Although many people who are against partial-birth abortion are against abortion in general, there is no necessary link, as partial-birth abortion is a particularly horrifying form of abortion. This is for the reasons already explained: it involves a deliberate, murderous physical assault on a half-born baby, whom we know for certain will feel pain and suffer as a result. We accept that there is some legitimate medical debate about whether embryos and earlier foetuses feel pain; there is no such debate in this case, and this is why partial-birth abortion is uniquely horrific, and uniquely unjustifiable.</p>        </div>
