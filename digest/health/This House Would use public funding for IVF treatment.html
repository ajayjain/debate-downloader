    <h1 class="print-title">This House Would use public funding for IVF treatment</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>IVF (in vitro fertilization) treatment is a medical procedure to assist infertile (or otherwise unable) couples to conceive children. The process involves fertilizing egg cells with sperm outside of the womb (in vitro), and then transferring the fertilized egg (zygote) into either the biological mother’s womb, or the womb of a surrogate. Babies conceived through IVF are colloquially known as ‘test tube babies’. Pregnancy rates are around 35% (although this varies a lot between clinics), which means that many couples need to go through several ‘cycles’ of treatment before successfully conceiving – this is one of the reasons why costs are so high. Prices for one cycle of treatment range from around $4000 in Japan to $12,500 in the USA.<a href="/print/17798#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The overall cost per live birth ranges from $40,000 in the USA and the UK to $24,500 in Scandinavia and Japan. Some countries (e.g. Belgium, Sweden, Australia and Israel) provide funding for several cycles of IVF, while the UK’s NHS provides funding for just one cycle.<a href="/print/17798#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Countries, which have currently implemented the policy of public funding, have strict regulations regarding for those desiring publicly funded IVF. Usually there are publicly funded consultations and publicly funded treatments. &nbsp;In New Zealand, the duration of infertility has to be at least one year and it has to be known to doctors that there is a severe cause for the infertility. Also in Auckland specific eligibility criteria are that the woman has to be less than 40 years old at referral, is not obese and has not been smoking for at least 3 months before the treatment.<a href="/print/17798#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Similar policies, which will be eligible for public funding, could also be implemented in other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The debate can be set up by the proposition as providing one or more cycles as part of a national health service (so the state actually provides the treatment), or as the state subsidizing patients to receive the treatment privately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Countries, which have currently implemented the policy of public funding, have strict regulations regarding for those desiring publicly funded IVF.

                    <p>Having children is such an important aspect of most people’s lives that it should be considered a right. For many people, their status as parents is a key part of their identity, and their devotion towards their children is indicative of how important parenting is to them. The right to start a family is recognized in article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights and article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, this right is apportioned unevenly. Couples who are unable to have children naturally, either because of medical infertility or because they are a same-sex couple, are unable to conceive children unless they are wealthy enough to afford private IVF treatment. This may affect many people given the extremely high cost of IVF treatment. Being unable to exercise this right should not depend on income, so the state must financially assist couples who are unable to afford treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And even if we believe this right is not basic, and more a choice of a lifestyle, if the state has the possibility to ensure it to everyone, why not maximize rights and make as many people happy as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The state gives every human being the “right to reproduce”, which is not equal with a right to become a parent by all means.</p><p>We may concede the significance of parenting to people, and may even go so far as to concede that a right to parenting exists (though it is questionable). However, it is parenting that is a right, not producing offspring. Nobody could, in all sincerity, say that having children with whom they share genes is vital to their identity, and that they couldn’t live a meaningful life without children who are genetically theirs. Therefore, the state can fulfill its duty to provide children for couples who wish to be parents by funding adoption services. There is no right to have a child just because you wish so; actually creating one child merely to help another is to undermine the value of humanity. Every individual must be considered as an end in themselves, as Kant wrote, not merely as a means to assist another.</p>        </div>

                    <p>If the state funded IVF treatment, it would overcome some of the inefficiencies involved in expensive medical treatment. Costs would be brought down as economies of scale are exploited, and state health services have better bargaining power when it comes to purchasing large orders of drugs and equipment. A higher rate of treatment within the population would increase safety and improve outcomes (thus reducing costs), as medical departments become more experienced. Most significantly, an asymmetry of information exists between doctor and patient (as it does with all medical treatment) – patients are not aware of what services they need, and are unable to weigh up the various options available to them, because doing so requires medical training. This drives up prices, as doctors have incentives to ���over treat’ patients, and not to treat patients in the most cost-effective manner. Providing state funding would make the state the purchaser of IVF services (or even the direct provider of them), removing either the ability to over treat or the incentive to do so (depending on whether the state is the buyer or the provider).</p>        </div>

                    <p>The state could reduce the cost of all kinds of goods and services by using its market power to drive down prices. There are even other (non-medical) services that suffer from the asymmetry of information problem described by the proposition, such as car maintenance, audio-visual equipment, and health foods/supplements. Nobody advocates the state intervening in these markets, so what is special about healthcare?</p><p>Surely it is because society is uncomfortable with the prices of essential goods such as health treatment being driven up because of consumer ignorance (while we are not so concerned with the price of hi-fis and brake pad replacements). This concern for efficiency derives from our concern about people’s health. However, such an approach is not warranted for non-essential medical treatment, such as cosmetic surgery and IVF treatment. Under this logic we should also fund from the state budget liposuctions, because the cost of an average liposuction (from 3000 to 7500 dollars).<a href="/print/17798#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> As a non-essential medical procedure, IVF should be thought of as fitting into the TVs and health foods category, not the same category as life-saving medical treatment.</p><div><a href="/print/17798#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Cost of Liposuction, Liposuction.com, <a href="http://www.liposuction.com/cost-of-liposuction.html">http://www.liposuction.com/cost-of-liposuction.html</a>, accessed 08/22/2011</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Most couples which decide to do IVF treatments do not have unlimited funds available to them. Therefore, once they decide to do IVF treatments in order to reduce the costs of more cycles, couples and clinicians (with only private funds) typically opt to implant numerous embryos, hoping at least one will survive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While this may reduce the cost of treatments, it can result in “multiples” – anything from twins to the infamous “Octomom” octoplets.

                    <p>There are benefits to the state in promoting fertility treatments and so encouraging more people to have children. Most developed countries have rapidly aging populations with too few young people to be able to maintain their pensions systems over the next thirty years. To avert demographic crisis governments need to do more to encourage couples to start families. Many states already support couples who have children through the benefits system; some like Italy even pay a lump sum to couples on the birth of each child. Funding IVF to increase the number of births is an obvious extension of this principle. It would also be right for society through the state to fund IVF, as career expectations and the high costs of housing force many couples now delay starting a family until they are in their thirties, by which time they may need medical help to conceive.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Although individual countries may have demographic problems, overall the world needs to restrain population growth. There is something hypocritical about developed countries encouraging poor ones to promote family planning and smaller families, while funding IVF to increase the number of births at home. Ultimately richer countries will have to be more open to immigration if they want to fix their demographic problems. In any case, providing IVF will make no significant impact on the actual birth rate in developed countries, but will impose high medical costs on the state.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The state has to look in its policies for the most benefit it will have to the society in the particular country and in the world. Therefore in a policy should also be included what happens with children who are already born, but do not have parents.&nbsp; In the world, there actually are many children, without a family, that would need parents far more. According to studies, only in Central and Eastern Europe, there are around 1.5 million children in out-of-home care, such as orphanages and foster care.<a href="/print/17798#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In the UK there were 64 000 children in the local authority care.<a href="/print/17798#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> These children do not have parents, great care or facilities that people considering IVF would give to the children. So it should be in the states interest to rather than enabling citizens to have genetically related offspring, to find home to the orphan children that are present today. Because the state should take a shift in policies which improves the lives of the already born children, we should not support state sponsored IVF.</p><div><a href="/print/17798#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Child adoption statistics around the world, The Labor of Love <a href="http://www.thelaboroflove.com/articles/child-adoption-statistics-around-the-world">http://www.thelaboroflove.com/articles/child-adoption-statistics-around-the-world</a>, accessed 08/22/2011<br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17798#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>Adoption facts and figures, Adoption UK, <a href="http://www.adoptionuk.org/information/103152/e_factsandfigs/">http://www.adoptionuk.org/information/103152/e_factsandfigs/</a>, accessed 08/22/2011</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Even if having offspring is not considered a right, it is still something people value as a lifestyle. Given the choice, many (if not most) people would opt to produce their own children rather than adopt. This is evident from revealed preference – far more people have children through conception and pregnancy than adoption. Even the existence of a private market for IVF indicates that, for some people, having children with whom they share genes is an important part of their life. Adoption, therefore, cannot be a full substitute for IVF, which gives parents children that they can see themselves in (because of shared characteristics or physical features, for example) and gives mothers the chance to go through the process of pregnancy and childbirth, which can strengthen maternal bonds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Liberal societies, remaining neutral between various interpretations of the good life, should not prevent people from pursuing whichever lifestyle they choose – however, it is not the place of the government to pursue this lifestyle or finance it.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The health system loses with publically funding IVF. The problem is that the financial cost of IVF is such a great burden for the public health system that we should not support it. The procedures are too expensive and bear a too great risk of failure. A year (2010) after the province of Quebec allowed public funding of IVF, they’ve already performed 3,500 cycles – at a cost of $32-million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every IVF cycle is expensive – between $7,000 and $15,000 per cycle – which is comparable to the cost of heart surgery and some cancer treatments. This is an enormous cost for a treatment, that is not urgent or life endangering. Bear in mind too that only between 15 and 30 per cent of cycles result in pregnancy, depending on a woman’s age and other factors. Those numbers tell us that IVF is a high-stakes gamble.<a href="/print/17798#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The money spent on such treatments (until 2014, they expect to spend 80 million dollars), could be better used in improving lifesaving protocols or buying new equipment for usually already understaffed hospitals.&nbsp;&nbsp; With making this money available to other procedures potentially everyone could benefit, but with this only a few people with a specific wish do.</p><div><a href="/print/17798#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Picard A., When the state funds IVF, the cost is too high for everyone, The Globe and Mail, published 05/11/2011,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/new-health/andre-picard/when-the-state-funds-ivf-the-cost-is-too-high-for-everyone/article2018895/page1/">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/new-health/andre-picard/when-the-state-funds-ivf-the-cost-is-too-high-for-everyone/article2018895/page1/</a>, accessed 08/21/2011</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is not clear where the distinction between essential and non-essential medical procedures lies. The opposition cannot, in all sincerity, claim that the distinction lies between life-saving and ‘lifestyle enhancing’ treatment, since most national health services provide funding for technically non-essential services such as hip replacements (to aide mobility) and cataract surgery (to aide vision). The cost of such procedures are £7500- £13450.<a href="/print/17798#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp;These procedures are clearly funded out of a concern for people’s health, but health is conceived of in terms of quality of life as well as living itself. This also explains why health authorities evaluate the value of a procedure in terms of ‘quality adjusted life years’, not just years of life. A health service should surely be designed to improve people’s quality of life, not just to keep them alive. Since infertility reduces people’s quality of life, it seems congruent with the aims of a health service to provide the medical treatment to overcome it.</p><div><a href="/print/17798#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>Private hip replacement costs in the UK and abroad, Private Healthcare UK,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.privatehealth.co.uk/hospitaltreatment/whatdoesitcost/hip-replacement/">http://www.privatehealth.co.uk/hospitaltreatment/whatdoesitcost/hip-replacement/</a>, accessed 08/22/2011</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
