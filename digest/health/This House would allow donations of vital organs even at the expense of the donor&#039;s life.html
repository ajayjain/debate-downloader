    <h1 class="print-title">This House would allow donations of vital organs even at the expense of the donor&#039;s life</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Organ donations are one of the most vital steps of progress made in the field of medicine. Where the failure of a vital organ previously would lead to a person&rsquo;s imminent death, there is a chance today of saving lives by transplanting hearts, kidneys, livers etc. However, in the case of organs such as hearts and livers, transplantation can only take place if a patient&rsquo;s need coincides with the death of a donor. In the status quo, many people die as there is not a sufficient amount of organs that match the blood type and antibodies of the recipients.<a href="/print/51305#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;If these are not matched then there is a chance of rejection of the organ. Live donations are growing becoming more common and often increase survival rates but this is only for cases where an organ can be donated with little risk of life such as with a kidney.<a href="/print/51305#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This proposal is much more extreme as it would allow parents instead of standing by watching their children die, unable to do anything to save them to take action. The proposed motion would allow the relatives whose organs would save their loved one to donate their organ at the expense of their own life. While this is an attractive idea to some, for others it violates the fundamental principles of how we are to relate to life. It also touches upon the question of whether one can qualify and quantify human life. Regardless of which side might be found to be right, it is a motion that affects families at a pivotal point of their lives, but also health care professionals, religions, politicians and society as a whole<a href="/print/51305#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>.</p>

                    <p>We are biologically programmed to want to preserve our species. As such, our offspring will often be more important to ourselves than our own persons. Many doctors hear parents tell them how they wish that they could &ldquo;take over&rdquo; their child&rsquo;s terminal illness rather than have the child suffer.<a href="/print/51305#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;It is therefore natural and right for the older generation to sacrifice itself where possible to save the younger generation. As crass as this might seem, they are statistically more likely to die earlier than their offspring in any event and stand to lose less.&nbsp; They have had the chance to experience more of a life than their child. They are furthermore the cause of the child&rsquo;s existence, and owe it to the child to protect it at any cost.</p>

                    <p>Biology is a bad way of deciding moral behaviour. If we were to do what biology tells us to do, we would be no more than animals. Every person has a right to live their life and they do not lose it simply because they have family. In modern society we do not cease to live meaningful lives at the point when we have children, as Darwinians might have us believe, but many people have more than half of their valuable lives ahead of them at the point when their children are emancipated.</p>

                    <p>It is a fundamental principle of the human being is that every human is born autonomous. Therefore, we believe that every person has a right to his or her own body and is thus competent to make decisions about it. This is because we recognise that whatever decisions we might make about our bodies, stem from the knowledge that we have about our own preferences. Nobody can tell us how to value different goods and therefore what matters to one person might matter less to another. If we were to undermine this right, nobody would be able to live their life to its fullest as they would be living their life to someone else&rsquo;s fullest. The extension of this right is that if someone values another person&rsquo;s life over their own it is their informed decision to sacrifice themselves for that person. It is not for others to decide, and in particular not for the State.</p>

                    <p>Man is also a social being. While we have a right to our own body, we also have duties to those around us. If we choose to terminate our lives, we must consider the consequences for those who depend on us, physically or emotionally. Can we really judge whether our own life is less worth than that of the recipient? Human beings also often make decisions without all the relevant information. The choices we make may very well be ill-informed even if we believe otherwise. Part of the problem here is that all the consequences of our decisions can never be fully understood or anticipated.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>We have to be able to measure quality of life relatively. There might be many cases where a relative is terminally ill, yet not dead yet. This person, with a survival prospect of maybe half a year of suffering and medication, might have a perfectly functional organ.<a href="/print/51305#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;It is very rational, both for this person and for society as a whole to allow him or her to undergo euthanasia at an early stage to save the other person.<a href="/print/51305#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, a person might sacrifice his or her life to provide an organ for a specific individual, yet their other organs can still be used to save others, of whom the donor might not have been aware. It is sad that a person has to die, but as this is the only option<a href="/print/51305#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>, it is a good thing that several people might live when one sacrifices their life.</p>

                    <p>This will only lead to family members pressuring terminally ill people to commit suicide prematurely. Even those who are terminally ill, value life, possible even more than others. These people are vulnerable and bereft of hope they are prone to be pressured into such action&nbsp;(Tremblay).<a href="/print/51305#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> However, it is impossible to say whether six months of life for one person is more or less worth than six years for another. Furthermore, this assumes that we know that the recipient will indeed live that long, which we never can know about mortal beings.</p>
<p>As to the second part of the point, it is impossible to quantify human life. If the value of human life is indeed infinite, it is not as simple as to say that two lives are better than one. As long as we cannot say for sure, this is a slippery slope of quantifying human lives that we want to avoid at all costs.</p>

                    <p>There is a clear need around the world for more donors of organs. In the UK there are about 4000 transplants a year but there are always more waiting, in November 2012 there were 7593 people waiting so on average each will be waiting for almost two years.<a href="/print/51305#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In Germany there are over 12,000 waiting but only 2777 donations in 2012.<a href="/print/51305#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The sacrifice of individual relatives who willingly choose death to save their loved ones therefore brings the need for donations into focus. The media are likely to present heart-breaking stories about loving people who made the ultimate sacrifice. As a consequence, more people will be aware of the issue and wish to fill in donor cards so that they might be able to minimise the number of voluntary donations in the event of their death.&nbsp; Thus there will be more naturally donated organs available and more lives will be saved.</p>

                    <p>It is cynical to encourage people commit suicide to bring the media&rsquo;s attention to an issue. If there is too little attention, the problem lies with the media and needs to be solved by changing the media. It is not the responsibility of vulnerable relatives to sacrifice their lives to redress that issue.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the proposal were to be put into practise, the government would be communicating that organ donations primarily is an issue for the family of the sick person.&nbsp; Thus, people will be less keen to donate their organs to someone that they do not know, as they believe that there will be a family member who will sort it for them.&nbsp; Sacrificial donations are always inferior and the motion would make them the norm rather than what is the case in the status quo.</p>

                    <p>Many people, especially those who belong to religious groups believe that we have a duty to preserve our own lives. They would argue that suicide is never justified, even if the reasons might appear to be good. It is impossible to sacrifice your life for others, because you cannot know how important your life is to others in relation to how important other people&rsquo;s lives are. Either life is invaluable and it is thus impossible to value one life higher than others, or it can be valued, but it is impossible for us to assess our life&rsquo;s value in relation to others. Therefore, while we accept that some might die, it is not for the individual to take matters into his or her own hands and accelerate the process, as this decision might be made on the wrong grounds, but cannot be reversed.</p>

                    <p>By allowing sacrificial donations society becomes vulnerable to abuse of this system. It is possible that people are scared or coerced into sacrificing their lives for others. While society does all it can for those who are ill, it cannot start moving the boundaries for when it actively takes the lives of its citizens.</p>
<p>Even when there is no coercion, we cannot even know when a person is beyond all hope. Even in the direst situations, there are exceptional cases when people recover. However, if we take a person&rsquo;s vital organs, the process is irreversible. Therefore, it is always wrong to prematurely kill another person, while the recipient is still alive and within the realm of luck and miracles. In the status quo the donor is already dead and the trade-off is not a problem, but this cannot be extended to the living</p>

However, the harm of a person potentially being vulnerable is significantly lesser than that of a person dying because everyone who wanted to help this person had their hands tied.</p>

                    <p>If the purpose of society and the health sector is indeed to promote life and preserve health, surely it must be in that interest to find ways of saving people&rsquo;s lives when possible. Whoever dies and leaves an organ behind saves a life, and often more than one life as shown by the UK having carried out 3960 transplants with 2143 donors in 2011-12,<a href="/print/51305#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> and there is thus no loss of life.
