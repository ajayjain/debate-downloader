    <h1 class="print-title">This House Believes Instant Replay Should Be Used in Major League Baseball</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Major League Baseball (MLB), often referred to as “America’s pastime,” is unlike some other sports because it largely disallowing the use of instant replay to determine whether an umpire’s call was correct.&nbsp; Unlike American football—which allows videos of any play to be reviewed and, potentially, for officials’ calls to be reversed—baseball uses instant replay only for “boundary calls” involving potential home runs (in questions of whether a struck ball was a home run or a foul, or in situations where it’s unclear whether a fan interfered with a potential home run).&nbsp; Though the decision to adopt this limited degree of instant replay was a watershed in baseball history, many are calling for the sport to embrace instant replay more thoroughly by permitting it in a wider variety of situations.&nbsp; It has been reported that MLB officials are considering this expansion for the coming season.<a href="/print/17912#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Though the push for instant replay has existed for years and seems to grow stronger whenever there is a high-profile mistake by an umpire, it reached unprecedented intensity after a notorious blown call in June 2010.&nbsp; Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga was one out away from a perfect game—among the rarest and most revered accomplishments in baseball—against the Cleveland Indians when the umpire incorrectly ruled a runner safe at first base.&nbsp; Video footage showed beyond any doubt that the umpire blew the call and that Galarraga had been wrongly deprived of a place in baseball history.</p><p>Instant replay advocates differ in how they believe the sport should adopt the practice—for example, whether it should be limited to certain types of plays, or whether there should be a time limit.&nbsp; Though these are important questions, many arguments in this debate do not hinge on the specific mechanics of the instant replay used.</p><p><a href="/print/17912#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Ben Walker, “MLB Leaning Toward Expanding Instant Replay For 2012,” Associated Press, April 14, 2011, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/14/mlb-expanding-instant-replay-2012_n_849274.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/14/mlb-expanding-instant-replay-2012_n_849274.html</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

                    <p>The main goal of an umpire is to make accurate calls.&nbsp; Umpires are meant to ensure that a player who is out is called out, for example, and that a foul ball is ruled a foul ball.&nbsp; When an umpire makes an incorrect call, he is falling short of fulfilling his primary responsibility.&nbsp; As the official rules of Major League Baseball instruct umpires, “The first requisite is to get decisions correctly....&nbsp; Umpire dignity is important but never as important as ‘being right’” (Official Baseball Rules, Rule 9.05).<a href="/print/17912#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Without a doubt, instant replay helps to improve the accuracy of calls.&nbsp; When a play can be reviewed after the fact, in slow-motion, from multiple angles, it’s almost inevitable that the result will be a more accurate judgment.&nbsp; Instant replay serves as an additional tool for umpires, allowing closer examination of events.&nbsp; By providing umpires with an extra set of eyes, video cameras will better enable umps to fulfil their purpose.</p><p><a href="/print/17912#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Major League Baseball, <em>Official Baseball Rules</em>, <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2010/official_rules/2010_OfficialBaseballRules.pdf">http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2010/official_rules/2010_OfficialBaseballRules.pdf</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Umpires have to balance several important considerations: ensuring impartiality (and the appearance of impartiality as well); avoiding unnecessary delays in the game; ensuring that all rules are followed; and to behave in a manner that compels respect from all parties.&nbsp; To argue that the umpire’s job comes down to accurate calls is to oversimplify a very complicated role.&nbsp; As the official rules of Major League Baseball instruct umpires: “When you enter a ball park your sole duty is to umpire a ball game as the representative of baseball....&nbsp; Keep the game moving.&nbsp; A ball game is often helped by energetic and earnest work of the umpires” (Official Baseball Rules, Rule 9.05).<a href="/print/17912#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p><a href="/print/17912#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2010/official_rules/2010_OfficialBaseballRules.pdf">Ibid</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Umpires must make split-second judgments, often from bad angles and with many elements to watch simultaneously.&nbsp; Mistakes will happen.&nbsp; Even the official rules acknowledge this when it tells umpires, “You no doubt are going to make mistakes” (Official Baseball Rules, Rule 9.05).<a href="/print/17912#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> &nbsp;Some calls will have to be made from a significant distance away from where the umpire is located—a commonly cited justification of MLB’s adoption of instant replay on boundary calls.<a href="/print/17912#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp; Fans hold umpires to an exceptionally high standard; as former umpire Nestor Chylak put it, “They expect an umpire to be perfect on Opening Day and to improve as the season goes on.”<a href="/print/17912#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>&nbsp; But it is impossible for a human to attain perfection on his own, so we should provide him with the tools that will enable him to meet the exacting standards set out for him.</p><p>It is folly to withhold technology that is already available.&nbsp; Even MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, generally an opponent of instant replay, acknowledged “that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis” when he announced its adoption on boundary calls.<a href="/print/17912#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>&nbsp; Just as we would never countenance a rule prohibiting umpires from wearing eyeglasses to see calls better, we should also not tolerate a rule that essentially keeps umpires blind to a reality that everyone else—reporters, coaches, and fans—has access to.&nbsp; Well-respected Sports Illustrate columnist Joe Posnanski captured this point well: “Baseball ... should institute replay because it’s just not sustainable in today’s technological world to make bad calls on the field. &nbsp;Those days are over....&nbsp; You can’t keep giving the fans at home better access to the truth than the home plate umpire.”<a href="/print/17912#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Instant replay is a necessary tool to help umpires “see” better.</p><p><a href="/print/17912#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2010/official_rules/2010_OfficialBaseballRules.pdf">Ibid</a>.</p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17912#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Ed Price, “Baseball Brunch: Upon Further Review…,” <em>AOL News</em>, May 31, 2009, <a href="http://www.aolnews.com/2009/05/31/baseball-brunch-upon-further-review/">http://www.aolnews.com/2009/05/31/baseball-brunch-upon-further-review/</a>.</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17912#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> “Umpire Quotes,” <em>Baseball Almanac</em>, <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/quotes/umpire_quotes.shtml">http://www.baseball-almanac.com/quotes/umpire_quotes.shtml</a>.</p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17912#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> Jack Curry, “Baseball to Use Replay Reviews on Homers,” <em>New York Times</em>, Aug. 26, 2008, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/sports/baseball/27replay.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/sports/baseball/27replay.html</a>.</p></div><div id="ftn5"><p><a href="/print/17912#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> Joe Posnanski, “Meals and Squeals,” <em>SI.com</em>, July 27, 2011, <a href="http://joeposnanski.si.com/2011/07/27/meals-and-squeals/">http://joeposnanski.si.com/2011/07/27/meals-and-squeals/</a>.</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Everybody knows umpires make mistakes; it happens often enough that fans and players all recognize it is part of the game.&nbsp; Nobody expects umpires to be perfect, but everyone wants umpires to strive for perfection.&nbsp; It’s just like with players: everybody wants their favourite players to strive to play perfectly, but nobody actually expects them to be perfect.&nbsp; Thus, we can’t sacrifice other elements of the game (discussed elsewhere in this debate) on the altar of perfection.</p><p>It is disingenuous to liken instant replay to eyeglasses or to mere tools to “supplement” umpires’ skill.&nbsp; Instant replay becomes a substitute for—not a supplement to—umpires’ skill.&nbsp; There is no skill involved in watching a slow-motion replay and determining whether a player was tagged; millions of fans do that each night from the comfort of their living rooms.&nbsp; We do not want the fundamental character of baseball to be changed by removing umpires from the equation, which is what happens every time instant replay is used.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Not all video reviews will lead to an accurate ruling.&nbsp; Sometimes, camera angles could give a tricky, incorrect impression.&nbsp; Or they could shed little light on what actually happened.&nbsp; In these cases, instant replay will afford the appearance of certainty when the reality is much more complicated.&nbsp; In addition, all of the harms of inaccurate calls that Proposition is trying to solve will continue to exist.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Even if instant replay will not result in 100% accuracy, it will improve the chance that any individual reviewed call will be made correctly.&nbsp; In the status quo, umpires make their calls as if they’re certain, so projecting false certainty really should not be a major concern for the Opposition.&nbsp; What video review will do is ensure that the umpire can be at least as confident about his call as the managers, coaches, and millions of viewers watching at home.</p>        </div>
