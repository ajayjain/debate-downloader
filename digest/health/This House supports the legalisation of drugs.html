    <h1 class="print-title">This House supports the legalisation of drugs</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Current drugs policy in many Western countries is loosely based on the principle that drugs are criminalised in proportion to their harmfulness. Typically, whilst alcohol and nicotine are legal, a wide variety of other stimulants and narcotics (for example, heroin, cocaine, cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamines) are deemed illegal. Usually the penalty attached to possession of these drugs varies according to their perceived harmfulness; for example, a “hard” drug like heroin attracts harsher punishment than a “soft” drug like cannabis. Supplying others with a drug also usually attracts a harsher penalty than possessing a small amount for purely personal use. Some countries, such as the UK, attempt to codify harmfulness by operating a grading system for illegal drugs (‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’)<a href="/print/17814#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>; in others, assumptions about harmfulness are expressed through policing and sentencing policy.</p><p>Across the world, approaches to drugs vary, from liberal policies in the Netherlands where many “soft” drugs are in effect tolerated, to the harsh policies of Singapore, which hands out the death penalty for certain drug-related crimes. However, “hard” drugs such as heroin and cocaine are pretty much universally illegal. In debating this topic, the proposition needs to be clear about the implications of their case; typically they need to argue for the legalisation of “hard” drugs as well as “soft” ones. They may also wish to present some kind of model or plan whereby the quality and marketing of drugs is regulated (for example, in ways similar to controls on tobacco and alcohol in many countries).</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17814#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Wikipedia, ‘List of controlled drugs in the United Kingdom’, <em>en.wikipedia.com</em>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_controlled_drugs_in_the_United_Kingdom">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_controlled_drugs_in_the_United_Kingdom</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

Since the pleasure gained from drugs and the extent to which this weighs against potential risks is fundamentally subjective, it is not up to the state to legislate in this area. Rather than pouring wasted resources into attempting to suppress drug use, the state would be better off running information campaigns to educate people about the risks and consequences of taking different types of drugs.</p>        </div>
