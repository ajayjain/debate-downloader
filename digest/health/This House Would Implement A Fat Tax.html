    <div class="print-content"><p>The WHO reports that “in 2008 1.5 billion adults, 20 and older, were overweight with a Body Mass Index (a proxy measurement of body fat based on height and weight) over 25 and that of these 1.5 billion overweight adults, over 200 million men and nearly 300 million women were obese (BMI &gt; 30). Overall, more than one in ten of the world’s adult population was reported to be obese. Once considered a high-income country problem, overweight and obesity are now on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings. Close to 35 million overweight children are living in developing countries and 8 million in developed countries.”</p><p>The WHO notes that “Overweight and obesity are the fifth leading risk for global deaths. At least 2.8 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. In addition, 44% of the diabetes burden, 23% of the ischemic heart disease burden and between 7% and 41% of certain cancer burdens are attributable to overweight and obesity.”<a href="/print/17791#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Since one of the factors that contributes to obesity is the inordinate amount of calories consumed<a href="/print/17791#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, and given the fact that fats have more than twice as much calories (9 kcal/g) than protein and carbohydrates (4 kcal/g) on a gram basis<a href="/print/17791#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>, could introducing disincentives to fat consumption curb the obesity epidemic?</p><p>We would implement a flat tax on food items high (in excess of 20% of the daily requirements) on saturated fats, salt and sugar.

                    <p>A sin tax is a term often used for fees tacked on to popular vices like drinking, gambling and smoking. Its roots have been traced back to the 16<sup>th</sup> century Vatican, where Pope Leo X taxed licensed prostitutes.<a href="/print/17791#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>More recently, and with greater success, US federal cigarette taxes were shown to have reduced consumption by 4% for every 10% increase in the price of cigarettes.<a href="/print/17791#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>Given the success achieved with uprooting this societal vice, which on a number of counts is similar to the unhealthy food one - immense health costs linked to a choice to consume a product – we should employ this tried and true strategy to combat the obesity epidemic.</p><p>In fact, a recent study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine followed 5000 people for 20 years, tracking food consumption and various biological metrics. The report states that “Researchers found that, incremental increases in price of unhealthy foods resulted in incremental decreases in consumption. In other words, when junk food cost more, people ate it less.”<a href="/print/17791#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><p>Thus leaning on the successful tradition of existing “sin” taxes and research that points out the potential for success of a similar solution in this arena, it should be concluded that a fat tax is an important part of a sensible and effective solution to the obesity epidemic.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17791#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Altman, A., A Brief History Of: Sin Taxes, published 4/2/2009, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1889187,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1889187,00.html</a>, accessed 9/12/2011</p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17791#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> CDC, Steady Increases in Tobacco Taxes Promote Quitting, Discourage Smoking, published 5/27/2009, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/features/SecondhandSmoke/">http://www.cdc.gov/features/SecondhandSmoke/</a>, accessed 14/9/2011</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17791#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> O'Callaghan, T., Sin taxes promote healthier food choices, published 3/10/2010, <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2010/03/10/study-sin-taxes-promote-healthier-food-choices/">http://healthland.time.com/2010/03/10/study-sin-taxes-promote-healthier-food-choices/</a>, accessed 9/12/2011</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

The challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century are vastly different from those of a hundred or more years ago, when that idea of government was popular or mainstream.</p><p>Given the very recent and very cataclysmic events involving the world’s economy, that were arguably sparked by some very bad financial choices made by consumers, one could think that societies around the globe would be more than ever inclined to answer yes to those questions.</p><p>In fact, what the government is doing in this case is respecting its boundaries – it cannot ban certain choices of food outright, although this might be the fastest solution. What it’s doing instead is providing a disincentive for a certain individually and societally harmful choice. That sort of action is entirely legitimate, as it doesn’t infringe on a person’s right to make a certain choice, yet it awards those who make the socially conscious one and it also protects the society in general from harm, since it takes important steps to reduce medical spending.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
