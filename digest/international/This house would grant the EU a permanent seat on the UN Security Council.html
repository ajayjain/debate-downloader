    <h1 class="print-title">This house would grant the EU a permanent seat on the UN Security Council</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is one of the main institutions of the United Nations. It was created after WWII to maintain international peace and security. Based on its founding charter (the United Nations Charter), it has the power to establish peacekeeping missions, impose international sanctions, and can authorise military action against a sovereign state.</p>
<p>The UNSC has fifteen members. There are five permanent (P5) members (China, France, Russia, the UK and the USA) wielding veto power, and ten elected non-permanent members with two-year terms, half of whom are replaced each year. These elected members are chosen by the United Nations Regional Groups. The &lsquo;African group&rsquo; chooses three members; the &lsquo;Latin America and the Caribbean group&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Asian group&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;Western European and Others&rsquo; group choose two members each. The Eastern European group chooses one member. Finally, the tenth of these members will be an Arab country, alternately from the Asian or African group.The European Union (EU) is an economic and political union, currently consisting of 27 member states, including two permanent members of the UNSC: France and the UK. Originally, the EU was created mainly for closer economic cooperation, but political goals have been added along the way. One of these political goals is to create a common security and foreign policy. Until the end of 2009 (when the Treaty of Lisbon came to effect), one of the three official &lsquo;pillars&rsquo; of EU policy was the Common Security and Foreign Policy (CSFP). The Lisbon Treaty merged the Common Foreign and Security Policy with the work of the European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy, creating a &lsquo;High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy&rsquo;. The High Representative is in charge of the new European External Action Service (EEAS), a diplomatic service of sorts for the EU. It remains the case that the High Representative can only speak for the EU in foreign policy areas where all 27 member states agree; foreign affairs remains an area where all member states retain a veto.</p>
<p>The European Union secured &lsquo;super-observer&rsquo; status on the 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2011. This grants &ldquo;the delegation of the European Union the right to make interventions, as well as the right of reply and the ability to present oral proposals and amendments&rdquo; in the United Nations General Assembly.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>Given the increased activity of the EU in foreign policy areas, the question has arisen whether the EU should get a permanent seat on the UNSC, replacing France and the UK who would lose their permanent seats. This case examines the arguments for and against that specific proposal.</p>

                    <p>The United Nations is a global body that must represent the whole world. Just as democratic governments need to remain representative to be legitimate so the same is true of intergovernmental organisations. If the UK and France hang on to their permanent seats forever, the UNSC will lose its legitimacy, as the United Nations will no longer be seen to be representative. The result will be an increased risk of war and conflict because the world’s major powers have no legitimate shared arena for discussing their interests. This is exactly what happened to the League of Nations after World War I. As many of the most powerful nations, USA, USSR and Germany were unwilling to join or barred from joining the League never had much legitimacy. As a result the League was unable to prevent conflicts in Manchuria and Abyssinia (Ethiopia) eventually leading to World War II.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Since their interest in a stable world through the legitimacy of the UNSC outweighs their interest in a formal veto-power, France and the UK should be willing to give up their veto power.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17653#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Kissinger, Diplomacy</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>There is a good reason why previous attempts at reforming the United Nations Security Council have not succeeded. Reform has been attempted several times since 1992 when Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali called for a renewal of the United Nations by 1995.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The ‘G4’ made up of Germany, Japan, Brazil and India has been lobbying to become permanent members but are opposed by others who want more non-permanent seats.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Kofi Annan in 2005 suggested two options either 6 new permanent members with no veto or eight four year renewable terms,<a href="/print/17653#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> but this too has gotten nowhere. No matter who is on the council some countries will feel aggrieved. If Brazil becomes a member Argentina and Mexico will object, China might object to India becoming a permanent member and Pakistan certainly would.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> In Africa it is not even certain who should represent the continent as there is no single leader, whoever is chosen some countries would not like the result. It is therefore better to leave things how they are. The current UNSC has been recognised as legitimate for more than sixty years this is not about to change.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17653#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Boutros-Ghali, ‘An Agenda for Peace’, 1992, <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/SG/agpeace.html">http://www.un.org/Docs/SG/agpeace.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17653#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Ariyoruk, ‘Players and Proposals in the Security Council Debate’, 2005, <a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/200/41204.html">http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/200/41204.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17653#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> United Nations Secretary General, ‘In larger freedom’, 2005, V, <a href="http://www.un.org/largerfreedom/contents.htm">http://www.un.org/largerfreedom/contents.htm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17653#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> Muns, 2006, <a href="http://www.europesworld.org/NewEnglish/Home_old/Article/tabid/191/ArticleType/ArticleView/ArticleID/20451/ReformoftheUNSecurityCouncilASpanishperspective.aspx">http://www.europesworld.org/NewEnglish/Home_old/Article/tabid/191/ArticleType/ArticleView/ArticleID/20451/ReformoftheUNSecurityCouncilASpanishperspective.aspx</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The permanent seats for France and the UK are based on the fact that they were among the great powers and victors of World War II. However, the global balance of powers has shifted significantly since then: France and the UK have declined; Britain’s manufacturing exports dropped from 25% of world manufacturing exports in 1945 to 5% in 2000.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp; And the UK was 6.52% of the world economy in 1950<a href="/print/17653#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> but down to 3.56 in 2010.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Moreover both had large empires which were lost in the decades after 1945. At the same time the EU has emerged as a major player in the international arena. The EU is one of the world’s largest trade blocs, has the world’s largest GDP, and represents almost half a billion people. A permanent seat for the EU would reflect those new power dimensions.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17653#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Schenk, 472, <a href="http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Content_store/Sample_chapter/0631220402/ACB26.pdf">http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Content_store/Sample_chapter/0631220402/ACB26.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17653#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Maddison, <a href="http://www.theworldeconomy.org/MaddisonTables/MaddisontableB-18.pdf">http://www.theworldeconomy.org/MaddisonTables/MaddisontableB-18.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17653#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> World Bank, <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD/countries/1W?display=default">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD/countries/1W?display=default</a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The EU might function as an economic union, but its original goal was to prevent war from ever happening again on the European continent. The political resolution of the Congress of Europe in 1948 said “it is the urgent duty of the nations of Europe to create an economic and political union in order to assure security and social progress… the creation of a United Europe is an essential element in the creation of a united world.”<a href="/print/17653#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The Economic integration is a means to this goal, by making member states economically too dependent on each other for them to want to declare war on each other. Given this history, the EU can contribute a lot of knowledge and experience on how to use ‘soft power’ in a foreign policy context. &nbsp;Europe has been successful in creating peace on a previously warlike continent. It has also had successes in encouraging reform in the countries of Eastern Europe and is continuing to do so in the Balkans through enlargement.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Croatia was at war with its neighbors fifteen years ago and part of Yugoslavia twenty years ago but will become the 28<sup>th</sup> member of the EU in 2013.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><p>Being a member of the UNSC would deepen Europe’s commitment to international peace-keeping and peace-making missions, something which currently varies very widely between member states, and push them to spend sufficient on equipping their militaries for such missions.

Africa with no obvious leader could be the most difficult to resolve, already there are six countries which say they would want to be Africa’s permanent member; Senegal, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and Libya.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> These disputes may in the end lead to a much enlarged permanent membership, so if the EU did taken over the UK and France’s seats, there would be a much greater likelihood that European interests will be outvoted on the Security Council.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17653#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Okumu, 2005, <a href="http://www.newsfromafrica.org/newsfromafrica/articles/art_10251.html">http://www.newsfromafrica.org/newsfromafrica/articles/art_10251.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[24]</span></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is widely recognised that the current Security Council set-up lacks legitimacy and requires reform. Major states such as Japan, and rising powers such as Brazil, South Africa and India deserve recognition and giving them permanent status would provide representation for a much broader cross-section of humanity. In such a reformed UN it is much harder to justify permanent places for the UK and France alone, two essentially similar western European countries. They should instead agree to be represented through an EU seat as part of an overhaul of the whole international system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>While the in number of EU members in the Security Council is obviously beneficial to the EU and its members the influence of the European Union is also beneficial to the UN system as a whole. European powers that are enthusiastic internationalists and proponents of international organisations act as a counterweight to other powers that still act like great nationalist powers from the 19<sup>th</sup> Century such as Russia and China.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> They are therefore enthusiastic about working through the UN rather than acting unilaterally. The European Union&rsquo;s international goals also dovetail well with the United Nations on a whole range of issues; development, peacekeeping, human rights, the environment, humanitarian aid and culture are all areas where there is a lot of cooperation; this means that the European Union is often acting in the interest of the United Nations.<a href="/print/17653#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This interest can obviously be best served by the European Union having more seats rather than only one.</p>

                    <p>The European States are obviously going to benefit from having large numbers of their members on the UN Security Council, and the United Nations itself is not harmed by it this overrepresentation comes at the expense of other regions. No other regions are so closely integrated &ndash; so countries in them don&rsquo;t have allies who they can rely on in the Council, and some of which don&rsquo;t have any members who have veto power. When compared to Europe that is not only integrated enough that the European States will most of the time take a common line and protect each other but who also have two states that can wield a veto the situation is grossly unfair.</p>
