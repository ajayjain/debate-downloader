    <h1 class="print-title">This House favours multilateral aid.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The giving of international aid has been taking place for decades, but the higher levels of international aid we know today are largely a phenomenon of the post-World War II era. Contrasting models of foreign aid giving are provided by programs like the Marshall Plan, involving bilateral aid arrangements with each of several European countries, and by the multilateral arrangements created by the Bretton Woods process (the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank). Historically, bilateral aid has dominated the foreign aid landscape. The major economic powerhouses&mdash;mostly former colonial powers and the United States&mdash;provide the bulk of foreign aid. Contributions by multilateral organizations such as the IMF and the World Bank have been controversial for their focus on economic development and the sometimes severe austerity measures they impose upon recipients. Because aid in both contexts is often tied to loans, critics have argued that aid has merely led to the dependence of developing countries on the developed world. Recently, countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have increased their contributions to NGOs or non-governmental organizations that provide help with a variety of different needs in recipient countries. Despite these changes, citizens and politicians in both the United States and Europe seem to be experiencing an increased level of &ldquo;aid fatigue,&rdquo; questioning the value of the continued expense.</p>

                    <p>Multilateral aid, particularly when delivered through NGOs or the UN, allows for the efficient pooling of financial resources. Much as when an individual makes a donation to a major charity, their small contribution goes much further when combined with those of many others. Particularly in the face of pressure to reduce foreign aid, America can still make a significant impact on development in other parts of the world through combining resources with other donors. By contrast, bilateral aid arrangements are often short-term and subject to change at short notice as a result of political or economic shifts in the donor country. Amidst growing fears of a U.S. debt default next week, for example, the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the House of Representatives has cut bilateral economic and development assistance to the rest of the developing world by an average of around 25 percent.<sup>1</sup> Multilateral aid programmes are therefore more stable and can plan more usefully for the long-term.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=56655"> Jim Lobe, 'Key Committee Slashes Foreign Aid', IPS, 27/07/2011,</a></p>        </div>

                    <p>Multilateral aid through NGOs or UN agencies is less cost-efficient. Direct aid means that that aid is immediately reaching its destination and can begin working for the recipient government. When funds go to multilateral aid organizations, some of these funds will be spent by the agency itself for administrative purposes. Those funds which reach the field are often seriously delayed. GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations), for instance, has been shown to lack price transparency and cost-effective purchasing for the money it is donating.<sup>1</sup> Moreover, when NGOs are used, the potential for abuse of resources exists, meaning less of the funds actually reach their intended destination. The UN, in particular, has a bad record of financial inefficiency.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.leftfootforward.org/2011/06/how-many-more-children-could-gavi-be-saving/"> Guppi Bola, 'How many more children should GAVI be saving?', Left Foot Forward, 14/06/2011, </a></p>        </div>

                    <p>The population of many countries are sceptical of the value of international aid, especially if it is multilateral and so not necessarily in the national interest. Multilateral aid contributions by the USA are likely to trade-off with American contributions to other UN or multilateral projects. In an age of increased budgetary pressures and increasing suspicion of international institutions, efforts to support multilateral economic aid would likely result in calls for cutbacks in other multilateral commitments, such as support for peacekeeping. The UK Coalition government Bilateral Aid Review found that bilateral aid contributes to building a safer, more stable and prosperous world which, in turn, helps keep Britain safe from instability, infectious disease and organised crime.<sup>1</sup> As this report showed, Bilateral arrangements are easier to justify as serving specific national interests.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Andrew Mitchell, 'Statement by the Secretary of State for International Development', Department for International Development, 01/03/2011</p>        </div>

                    <p>Multilateral aid arrangements help ensure that different bilateral arrangements do not work at cross-purposes. Years of development experiences have demonstrated that donors sometimes make mistakes in the arrangements they create. Dependency is sometimes fostered, conditions imposed on contributions are sometimes unreasonable and those administering the aid do not always consider the broader picture. If more than one country is approaching the recipient nation with different goals or conditions in mind, their uncoordinated efforts could cause unintended negative effects. Recently, for example, President Obama used a speech about multilateral institutions to praise the important role they are playing in and around the Middle East: he talked of the U.N. Security Council mandate for the ongoing NATO operation in Libya, and called on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to provide the G-8 with plans for bolstering Egypt and Tunisia.<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/05/19/the_roadblock_in_the_obama_doctrine"> David Bosco, 'The Roadblock in the Obama doctrine', Foreign Policy, 19/05/2011, </a></p>        </div>

                    <p>Bilateral aid has the potential to help in the war against terrorism, or with other security concerns, in a way that multilateral aid cannot. The United States has learned that it can help reluctant regimes to cooperate in the war on terror through financial incentives (most notably Pakistan). Moreover, direct aid can help improve a county's image in societies whose people might currently have negative or mixed attitudes toward it. In the past, security assistance has been aimed at helping allies along cold war divisions, promoting peacekeeping, creating regional peace accords, maintaining military bases, controlling nuclear weapons and narcotics, and fighting terrorism.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Multilateral aid tends to be less tied to the political self-interest of individual donor countries. One criticism of bilateral aid arrangements is that they are often drawn up based on self-interest. Major powers who provide international aid have tended to direct their aid to former colonies or countries with which they have significant strategic ties, economic interests or potential markets. Often, aid money must be spent on goods or services from the donor country. While the United States does not have as developed a colonial history as some other major donor states, it does have a history of providing aid to countries it sees as strategic partners. This was particularly true during the Cold War, but has now emerged as a practice in the war on terror. Aid that is given multilaterally is therefore much more likely to go to developing countries on the basis of need, and of where it has the most potential for good.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Providers of aid, for the very reason that they are spending their own money, should have their interests served by an aid arrangement. Significant opposition exists to foreign aid in the United States. For this reason, it is important to demonstrate to the American public that their tax dollars are being spent in a way that benefits the nation and/or is used responsibly by the recipient nation. Sadly, many aid dollars have been wasted on countries with corrupt regimes that have misused the funds, or the recipients have lacked the resources internally to use the funds productively. The World Bank's strategy in Africa, for example, has downplayed underlying structural oppressions in which they are complicit, including corrupt power relations.<sup>1</sup> This misuse is more likely to happen if aid is channelled through, and supervised by unaccountable international bureaucracies instead of given direct to countries in need.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.tni.org/article/world-banks-africa-strategy"> Patrick Bond, 'Neoliberalism, Poverty and Ecological Destruction', Transnational Institute, 06/2011, </a></p>        </div>

                    <p>Multilateral aid arrangements tend to avoid unnecessarily coercive conditions. One of the strongest criticisms of bilateral aid is the tendency for donor countries to place strict political, diplomatic or economic conditions on the receipt of that aid. For example, the United States greeted Pakistan's cooperation with the war on terror with a generous economic and military aid package, worth more than $18.7 billion between 2002 and 2010,<sup>1</sup> despite years of sanctions previously. Countries receiving development loans have often faced requirements for changes in internal policies on a range of issues not always directly tied to the aid itself.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/101101_Pakaidtable20100902.pdf"> K.

                    <p>Multilateral aid has the potential to be equally or more coercive than bilateral aid arrangements. The history of World Bank and International Monetary Fund austerity programs and structural adjustment policies in the developing world has amply demonstrated that sometimes multilateral organizations can impose potent and harmful conditions on recipients, interfering with the internal affairs of other nations and doing long-lasting harm. These agencies have also been heavily criticized for their focus on economic concerns at the expense of more basic human needs, such as health, education and the alleviation of poverty.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Working through the agencies of multilateral institutions and NGOs risks creating a dependency culture where unaccountable foreigners supply all the physical and social needs of local society. This can, in some countries, amount to a parallel administration, bypassing the proper government which is increasingly denied responsibility for managing anything important. Giving aid government-to-government instead strengthens responsible and accountable government. The DFID (Department for International Development) regards transparency as fundamental to improving its accountability to UK citizens and to improving accountability to citizens in the countries in which it works.<sup>1</sup> As bilateral aid is more transparent, it also helps to achieve more value for money in the deliverance of aid programmes and improves the effectiveness of aid in reducing poverty.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.humanitarianforum.org/data/files/eurdept2011.pdf"> 'Operational Plan 2011-2015: Europe Department', Humanitarian Forum, 04/11, </a></p>        </div>

                    <p>Multilateral aid agencies are more familiar with the regions or nations they work in. Many UN agencies and NGOs have been working in the communities they direct aid to for years. They are more aware of the unique needs of those societies and where the funds can be directed to do the most good. UNESCO's (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) budget, for example, goes towards promoting education and science. In developing countries, this has been critical in helping to raise teaching standards and mobilising resources from governments and other aid agencies, at all levels of education.<sup>1</sup> In this way, multilateral aid can directly and accountably develop the skills of the people living in developing countries on the ground level.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/unesco-must-accept-its-role-as-an-aid-agency-1.html"> David Dickson, 'UNESCO must accept its role as an aid agency', Science and Development Network, 11/03/2011, </a></p>        </div>
