    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes Europe still needs a constitution</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The European Constitution is an attempt to provide an overall restructuring of the current EU institutional layout in order to deal with important challenges such as continuing EU enlargement, the EU integration process and the increasing role the EU is expected to play in world affairs. The first proposition for a Constitutional Treaty was signed in Rome on the 29th October 2004. It combines and extends the different treaties on which the EU is currently based and presents it as one document that needs to be ratified by all member states in order to take action.</p><p>The treaty document proposes a series of important reforms. These include combining the three pillars into which current EU policy is divided, and clarifying in more detail the role of the EU Parliament, Council and Commission, giving almost exclusive legislative initiative and executive power to the Commission.<br>The Constitutional Treaty was ratified by national parliaments or referenda in eighteen EU member states, but has been rejected in referenda by two more. The ‘no’ votes need not have stopped the ratification process elsewhere, but a Constitutional Treaty cannot come into effect without the approval of all 27 EU states so in practice the proposed constitution was dead.</p><p>The situation with EU law has undergone a major change in 2009 when the Lisbon treaty came in action. The Lisbon treaty contains many of the changes the constitution attempted to introduce, for example: A politician chosen to be president of the European Council for two-and-a-half years; a new post - called High Representative - to give the EU more influence on the world stage and others. However there are also differences between the Constitution and the Lisbon treaty, which made the ratification of the treaty a fact. On an examination of the text of both documents, it seems that the substance of the Lisbon Treaty is largely similar to that of, the now defunct, the European Constitution in terms of the reforms it institutes.&nbsp; However, much of the symbolism of the Constitution has not been reproduced in the Lisbon Treaty.&nbsp; More significant perhaps, is the fact that the term “Constitution” appears nowhere in the text of the Lisbon Treaty. The Lisbon Treaty possesses several distinct features which are highly indicative of the fact that it is not a formal constitution as such. In addition to its lack of symbolism, the Lisbon treaty was not designed to stand alone but rather, merely, to amend the existing treaties.</p><p>The current debate will examine whether the EU needs a true Constitution other than the Lisbon treaty from two aspects. It is both a practical debate (does the EU need a constitution?) and a more abstract debate (is the EU the kind of entity/organisation that should adopt a constitution?) The arguments for and against an EU constitution rest on complicated issues of law, sovereignty, political philosophy and the efficiency and effectiveness of the EU’s institutions and procedures.</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>A comprehensive reform of the EU institutional layout is a must given the pressures created by the continuing enlargement process as well as the integration process. The existing EU architecture worked fine for a community of six states, and even for a group of twelve, but it is now desperately out-dated and unsuitable for a Union of 27 or more. For example, the national veto still applies in many areas, meaning one state can block progress even when the other 26 agree. Even when agreement is reached, it is often agonisingly slow and difficult to implement across the whole of the Union, often having to pass through every parliament. As a result EU decision-making has often been criticised as slow, complex and producing too many ‘lowest common denominator’ solutions, therefore Ireland can bring to a halt a vital treaty like Lisbon<a href="/print/18087#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> and the role of the Presidency and ‘foreign minister’ is a compromise that does not result in more unified policy.<a href="/print/18087#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> While still leaving the people feeling distant from the EU’s political processes, undermining legitimacy.<a href="/print/18087#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> A Constitutional Treaty is the only comprehensive tool that exists right now in order to allow for this necessary overall reform. &nbsp;</p><div><a href="/print/18087#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> BBC News, ‘Ireland rejects EU reform treaty’, 13 June 2008, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7453560.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7453560.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7453560.stm</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/18087#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Bellotti, Sarah M., and Dale, Reginald, ‘U.S. Media Snubs New EU Leaders’, <em>Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, </em>http://csis.org/blog/us-media-snubs-new-eu-leaders</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/18087#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Renda, Andrea, ‘Policy-Making in the EU; Achievements, Challenges and Proposals for Reform’, Centre for European Policy Studies, 2009, <a href="http://www.ceps.eu/files/book/1854.pdf" title="www.ceps.eu/files/book/1854.pdf">www.ceps.eu/files/book/1854.pdf</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>While comprehensive EU reform is in theory clearly desirable, in practice the EU has proven not to be ready for such a radical step. Historically, the EU has evolved by taking a series of little steps, as opposed to taking big jumps with big risks- “Europe has always moved forward one step at a time and it should continue to do so” - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble.<a href="/print/18087#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The EU is now facing a number of different crises – from the economic crisis that engulfed the Eurozone, to the social crisis that has spread throughout most of the EU members in the form of increasing opposition to migrants and a worrisome rise in nationalist and extremist parties and policies. The recent massacre in Norway (although outside the EU) is an example of this increasing extremism. Such violence “points to a dangerous undercurrent of hostility against the left’s platform, which is committed to open borders and multiculturalism.”<a href="/print/18087#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Any move to have constitutional reform will simply add to these pressures.</p><div><a href="/print/18087#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Kovacheva, Ralitsa, ‘Is the EU ready for a new Treaty?’ euinside, 7 September 2011 <a href="http://www.euinside.eu/en/analyses/is-the-eu-ready-for-a-new-treaty" title="http://www.euinside.eu/en/analyses/is-the-eu-ready-for-a-new-treaty">http://www.euinside.eu/en/analyses/is-the-eu-ready-for-a-new-treaty</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/18087#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> RT, ‘Rise of right-wing extremism rattles Europe’, 25 July 2011, <a href="http://rt.com/politics/norway-extremism-russia-multiculturalism/" title="http://rt.com/politics/norway-extremism-russia-multiculturalism/">http://rt.com/politics/norway-extremism-russia-multiculturalism/</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The current treaty-basis for the European Union is enormous, ambiguous and extremely complicated. The existing treaties regulate multiple levels from the constitutional to detailed market regulations. As a result of this individuals cannot easily read and understand the treaties as a US citizen for example.<a href="/print/18087#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It is difficult to keep track of each new Treaty that amends the pre-existing treaties. The adoption of a shorter, clearer document will make the EU much more ‘user friendly.’ The EU currently suffers from the fact that many of its citizens do not know what it is or what it does; EU citizens either do not know where to look for this information or are deterred and intimidated by the size of the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty. Having an easily digestible constitution will mean that the EU’s citizens can easily find out what the EU is and what it does.</p><div><a href="/print/18087#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Gjørtler, Peter, ‘ Lisbon Treaty - the Reform Treaty of the European Union’, grayston &amp; company, November 2009 http://www.graystoncompany.com/gco/articles/G&amp;C_article_Lisbon_Treaty_PG.pdf</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is true that the founding treaties are long and, in some places, rather difficult documents. It is also true that many EU citizens know little about the EU. It is too simplistic to say that the treaties are the reason for this as the majority of the population are not interested in reading the original documents and will be happy for bureaucrats or the media to highlight relevant parts. So a concise constitution is not the solution to these problems. Whilst the treaties themselves might be intimidating, many pamphlets, books and websites exist that do a fine job in summarising and explaining these documents – one such site is Europa.eu .<a href="/print/18087#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The EU also provides many European briefing units across Europe to educate citizens about the EU. The job of providing a simplified and accessible explanation of the EU is already done well without a constitution. If there is still widespread ignorance about the EU then this is unlikely to be solved by the introduction of yet another legal document which will also</p><div><a href="/print/18087#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Europa.eu, ‘Basic information on the European Union’ http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/index_en.htm</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Since the Maastricht Treaty, the citizens of EU member states have possessed parallel citizenship of the EU. However, European citizens do not identify themselves with the EU in the way that citizens of the USA self-identify as American. An important part of the patriotism of Americans is ‘constitutional patriotism;’ pride in their constitution and civic institutions. The European Union aims to bring about ever closer union between the peoples of Europe. It should foster a shared sense of ‘European identity’ by adopting a constitution, in which every citizen of the EU can take pride.</p>        </div>

The EU is an organisation in which twenty five nation-states cooperate with each other. Where necessary, these states pool their sovereignty in order to tackle common problems. The EU is thus an instrument used by nation-states to pursue their own interests in a world that makes it increasingly difficult for states to do this in isolation. The EU is a useful instrument of nation-states rather than a challenger to these states for the patriotism and loyalty of their citizens.</p><div><a href="/print/18087#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Manuel, Paul Christopher, and Royo, Sebastián, ‘Re-conceptualizing economic relations and political citizenship in the new Iberia of the new Europe’ Suffolk University, 4 May 2001, <a href="http://webcas.cas.suffolk.edu/royo/eu_spain_portugal.pdf" title="http://webcas.cas.suffolk.edu/royo/eu_spain_portugal.pdf">http://webcas.cas.suffolk.edu/royo/eu_spain_portugal.pdf</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/18087#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Turmo, Ivan and Bradley, Simon, ‘Poll reveals European mindset among Swiss’, swissinfo.ch, 11 August 2010, <a href="http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/foreign_affairs/Poll_reveals_European_mindset_among_Swiss.html?cid=22188596" title="http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/foreign_affairs/Poll_reveals_European_mindset_among_Swiss.html?cid=22188596">http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/foreign_affairs/Poll_reveals_Europe...</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has long treated the founding treaties as the constitutional documents of the European Union. Many commentators have noted the efforts of the ECJ to “constitutionalise” many principles – such as the direct effect and supremacy of Community law over the domestic laws of member states and the increasing protection of human rights – The ECJ is often overstepping its bounds when it comes to applying and interpreting the treaties.<a href="/print/18087#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The ECJ has often been accused of “judicial activism” in over-stepping the legitimate boundaries of courts in a democracy. By enshrining much of this creative jurisprudence in a democratically ratified constitution, the EU can assert and emphasise its status as a democratic entity, rather than an elite-driven process separate from the citizens of Europe.</p><div><a href="/print/18087#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Roberts, Linda, ‘The CARICOM Single Market and Economy and the Caribbean Court of Justice’, Southampton Working Papers in European Law, 2007/1, http://www.eulaw.soton.ac.uk/elpub/SWPEL3_Roberts.pdf</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Having a European Constitution would make very little difference to the role of the ECJ. It could still have an activist agenda in terms of interpreting the new constitution. The United States Constitution is one of the shortest in the world yet the United States Supreme Court has felt free to either stick very closely to the text or very liberally interpret it depending on the composition of the court. Accusing judges of “judicial activism” is often just cover for someone saying that they don’t like the decision.<a href="/print/18087#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The adoption of a binding constitution will therefore not increase democracy in the European Union. It will tie the hands of democratically elected governments in the member states and force them to an even greater extent to be subordinate to the judges in the ECJ.</p><div><a href="/print/18087#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Wallace, Chris, ‘Ted Olson on Debate Over Judicial Activism and Same-Sex Marriage’, Fox News Sunday, 8 August 2010, http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/ted-olson-debate-over-judicial-activism-and-same-sex-marriage</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>We already have such constitutional documents – the Treaty of Rome, the Maastricht Treaty and most importantly the Lisbon treaty from very recently (2009). The powers of, and relationships between the different institutional actors are clearly defined in the existing treaties. Just because the EU has expanded to incorporate new member states does not mean it needs a constitution. The Treaty of Nice was meant to have made the necessary amendments to facilitate enlargement. If it has failed, then we can simply amend the existing treaties again.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Constitutional ‘documents’ is exactly the problem. The EU is a very large (as of January 2007, 27 member states) international organisation with a considerable number of competencies and several important institutions. It is important to have one, clear document that precisely defines the different powers of, and relationships between the 27 member states, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Courts of Justice. But also the relationships between states that may have opted out of some parts of the EU; between those who are in Schengen and those who opted out, between those in the Eurozone and those outside. Complicated federal polities such as the United States, Germany and Switzerland have constitutions which define the limits of central power and the areas in which the states have autonomy; the EU should in this respect be no different.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The European Union should be wary of adopting a European Constitution as many states may not be able to abide by its terms.

                    <p>A failure of not having a ratified EU constitution will actually represent a more significant blow to the EU’s image abroad and at home.

The failure to reform could potentially lead to an actual collapse of the EU as we know it, which would have disastrous effects for the region as well as the world.<br>The failure of the Constitutional Treaty would also result in powerful disillusionment in the countries that have recently entered the EU or are applying to enter.
