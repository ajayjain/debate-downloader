    <h1 class="print-title">This House would give cash to the poor to reduce poverty</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>On New Year&rsquo;s Day 2013 India launched one of the most ambitious anti-poverty programs in history. It marked a radical change from India&rsquo;s previous anti-poverty policies which were charactarised by large subsidies on fuel, fertilizer and food. &ldquo;The idea is to move to a completely electronic Cash Transfer System for the entire population&rdquo; the subsidies will be abolished. The government will transfer up to 40,000 rupees ($720) per year for each household. The intention is that this immense change will just be in how money for poverty reduction is spent rather than affecting the total amount that is spent by the Indian state.</p>
<p>As the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh says &ldquo;Direct cash transfers are now becoming possible through the innovative use of technology and the spread of modern banking across the country&rdquo;.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The technology that is making this possible is Aadhaar a biometric identification system which every Indian is being signed up to. From this a cash transfer system will be used to electronically transfer benefits directly to the poor&rsquo;s bank accounts, which they will now be able to open because they have id on the Aadhaar system.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>As a radical change there will be close scrutiny of its progress and whether the change really does meet its goals of reducing corruption and eliminating poverty. Other countries will be considering whether to implement similar programs, will it provide a model to follow?</p>

                    <p>One of the reasons why poverty does not get eliminated is that it is governments who provide the subsidies that are intended to do just that. Many countries spend their money for subsidies poorly, for example in Indonesia before fuel subsidies were combined with cash subsidies in 2005 the top income decile received more than five times the amount of fuel subsidy as the bottom decile making the policy highly regressive despite it being politically sold as a subsidy to the poor.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> No matter the intention such subsidies are clearly not fair. When the government provides lots of different subsidies for different things; fuel, food, housing etc., and especially when some of them are universal, it is clear that it will never be possible to distribute the money fairly on the basis of need.</p>

                    <p>Subsidies are much fairer than providing cash. Subsidies can be directly targeted to provide the things that the poor need rather than letting the poor buy what they want. The government should not be providing money that is then being spent on cigarettes, instead it should be spent on food, heating, or the children&rsquo;s education. Yes some subsidies are poorly targeted but this simply shows that these subsidies are poorly implemented, not that they cannot be the solution to poverty. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Direct cash transfers can obviously be done very simply through simply handing out cash but this is clearly open to corruption. Instead money should be sent directly to the poorest&rsquo;s bank accounts. In India the proposal is that the payments will be linked to the new biometrics based ID system that assigns a unique number to everyone based upon physical traits<a href="/print/47424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> (although this is not yet fully implemented) this will reach the whole population including those who currently have no identity papers.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This will enable those who get these ID to set up a bank accounts to enable the cash to be transferred to them as it will in effect be giving them with new ID.</p>

                    <p>This is exactly why simply giving money to the poor is a bad idea; not everyone who is poor will have a bank account. Indeed those who are the poorest are by far the least likely to have one. In India only 21% of the poor have a bank account.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>Most methods of attempting to eliminate poverty through state intervention are bureaucratic and inefficient and therefore inevitably are not very helpful. The subsidies India has previously provided to the poor is a case in point. In reference to food subsidies that provide for a 50% subsidy for those below the poverty line a 2010 study by the Asian Development Bank found that in rural areas 73% of recipients were above the poverty line so should not have been receiving the subsidy.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Providing money directly into bank accounts on the other hand is efficient as it is transferred electronically and can be set up to transfer without any human intervention. For the same reason it is very difficult to embezzle because it is going straight to a bank account from central government funds without passing through anyone&rsquo;s hands.</p>

                    <p>All the evidence is that providing money directly to those who need it works much better than providing a mishmash of subsidies and credits decided by government. Providing money directly has been working with limited programs around the world, most prominently with Brazil&rsquo;s Bolsa Familia which has meant millions of children get primary education because of a small cash incentive.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>In India the state already spends a huge amount on inefficient poverty reduction programs. If all the money that is spent on these programs was transferred to providing for the direct cash payments equally among the 70million households below the poverty line then it would provide a monthly transfer of 2,140 Rs; more than the poverty line income for rural households.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>When it comes to the use of cash transfers on a large scale this is so far just wishful thinking; it may work but we don&rsquo;t yet really know. How can the proposal of all subsidies being changed to cash be compared to a small stipend for sending the children to school?&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The beauty of direct cash transfers is that it simply adds a new income stream but this is also its Achilles heel. Providing direct cash transfers will create dependency upon the transfers and reduce the incentive to be earning money from elsewhere. There are several reasons for this.</p>
<ul>
<li>First because the transfers from the government will be reliable, unlike much of the income the poorest have, the transfers will become the recipients main form of income. This will mean that there is less incentive to be earning money from other sources, which would often mean hard work, so as a result both harming the individual as they do not earn as much and the economy as they will not be contributing to the economy.</li>
<li>Secondly people will take up less work in order to qualify for the transfers; there is no reason to work more if that is simply going to mean that money you would have got from the government is taken away.</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantage of in-kind transfers is that they help avoid expectations of long term assistance or the state essentially providing everything.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Dependency has happened with food aid in Ethiopia where more than five million people have been receiving food aid since 1984; far from getting better the food security situation has if anything been declining during this time and there could be much better use made of Ethiopia&rsquo;s own resources; only 6% of the country&rsquo;s irrigable land is used for agriculture.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>Dependency is potentially a problem for any form of transfers with the intention of eliminating poverty while it is slightly different to be dependent on transfers of food the effect is the same. Direct transfers can however be made conditional upon the recipients doing what the government wants them to. In Brazil for example small cash transfers have been made conditional upon parents keeping their children in school.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> There is little reason the conditions could not include earning some money from other sources if it is suspected that individuals are becoming dependent.</p>

                    <p>Governments have accepted, in documents like the universal declaration of human rights, that one of their primary roles is to provide a basic standard of living for their citizens. When the state simply hands out some money this responsibility is not fulfilled. The state is simply leaving the poor to fend for themselves with a little extra money. Governments provide subsidies in kind or for specific products and services for a reason; those are the things that are necessities rather than luxuries. If money is transferred directly then the person who is getting the money can use the government&rsquo;s money on anything. Some may use it on the things the government was providing before but others will spend the money badly on tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. Subsidies however can be targeted at the things that the poor really need. This means the state provides subsidies for food, free or cheap housing and healthcare, fuel for cooking and heating etc.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>This is simply creating individual responsibility. A few will spend the money badly but most will realise that they need it for necessities. The whole point of the system is that it is flexible rather than limiting in the way other subsidy systems are. It should be considered that while some may misspend their money as suggested on drugs others may find ways of investing it so that they make more money and pull themselves out of poverty which then saves the government in the long term. Ultimately however it is the government that controls the flow of money; if someone is misspending it they can always halt the transfers.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>With subsidies at least the government knows what their money is being spent on. This is not the case with cash; it just gets taken and can be spent on anything. As already mentioned the most obvious examples are where the individual uses the money they are given on drugs or other harmful products not what they need. Yet there are times where individuals may simply not have their own best interests at heart for various reasons, particularly because they know no better. This does not just happen in economic situations but also in public heath. For example development agencies know that cooking on open fires in homes leads to thousands of deaths every year and is costly in terms of fuel. So thousands of clean smokeless stoves have been given out yet they are not being used despite them being cheaper to run and potentially a life saver.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>There are of course some occasions where the individual may use their money unwisely, but if they do then this is their choice. Those who receive aid are as deserving of being free to choose how to use their money as any wage earner. This choice only comes from providing cash rather than subsidies.<a href="/print/47424#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
