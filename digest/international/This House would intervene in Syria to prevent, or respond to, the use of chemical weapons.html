    <hr class="print-hr" />
    <h1 class="print-title">This House would intervene in Syria to prevent, or respond to, the use of chemical weapons</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>In Syria there have now been almost two years of conflict between the Ba&rsquo;ath Party of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and a fractured Arab spring inspired rebellion that incorporates a broad Syrian National Coalition, Kurds and Mujahideen from around the Middle East. It is now clear that intervention from outside the country, beyond the provision of weapons, will only happen if there is a major change in the situation on the ground. NATO and the United States have shown little inclination to intervene in any capacity on their own while Russia and China prevent any UN action that they believe might be opening the way to overthrowing President Assad&rsquo;s regime.</p>
<p>The United States however says that it does have red lines, which if crossed, will result in more US action. In August Obama stated &ldquo;We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.&nbsp; That would change my calculus.&nbsp; That would change my equation.&rdquo;<a href="/print/47098#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Chemical weapons are about the last possible line that has yet to be crossed in the brutal civil war where the United Nations estimates 60,000 people have died.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>There are of course significant difficulties with the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government being a red line that triggers intervention or some other form of reaction; most particularly how do we know when they are used? The use of chemical weapons my not be easy to spot from a satellite, and reports from either side on the ground would be inevitably biased if there are to be such consequences. This question is important because there are accusations that chemical weapons have been used already. The US consul general in Istanbul has sent the State Department a report that states &quot;We can&#39;t definitely say 100 percent, but Syrian contacts made a compelling case that Agent 15 was used in Homs on Dec. 23&quot;. The accusation is that a chemical weapon called Agent 15 was used. As chemical weapons go this is not a particularly nasty one; the attack caused five deaths and about 100 severe respiratory, nervous system, and gastrointestinal ailments.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> The number of deaths however is not particularly relevant if it means stepping over US red lines.</p>
<p>The State department however says &ldquo;we believe Syria&#39;s chemical weapons stockpile remains secured by the Syrian government&rdquo; and that they &ldquo;found no credible evidence to corroborate or to confirm that chemical weapons were used&rdquo; so for the moment we still do not know if chemical weapons have been used or not.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p>
<p>Either way the international community must be considering what it will do if it becomes clear that Chemical weapons have been used or if they are used more widely. Syria is thought to have one of the biggest Chemical Weapons arsenals in the world and may well also have biological weapons. It probably has large quantities of VX and had before the start of the civil war at least four large chemical weapons production facilities.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p>
<p>If chemical weapons are going to be used, or have been used, should there be intervention?</p>

                    <p>If Syria uses, or looks as if it is about to use, chemical weapons then this would be a clear escalation that would require action. Syria has never signed the Chemical Weapons Convention<a href="/print/47098#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> but it should be considered to be a part of customary international law so binding even on those who have not signed.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>The use of chemical weapons would also clearly be an attempt to cause huge numbers of casualties and large scale suffering. In 2005 with the United Nations World Summit the nations of the world signed up to &ldquo;If a State is manifestly failing to protect its populations, the international community must be prepared to take collective action to protect populations.&rdquo;<a href="/print/47098#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> So any intervention would be fully justifiable, and indeed should occur as Syria would be demonstrating that it is &ldquo;failing to protect its populations&rdquo; by using chemical weapons on them. There is no doubt that the world has a moral responsibility to prevent atrocities in Syria, these atrocities are already happening, but the world cannot stand by while the Syrian government escalates their scale through the use of chemical weapons.</p>

                    <p>Intervention would only be legitimate if it was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council or another country came directly under attack. What is being suggested while abhorrent does not meet either of these conditions. The Security Council is unlikely to agree to an intervention now and Syria would be very foolish to use their chemical weapons on a neighbour so inviting attack. The use of chemical weapons may be banned by international law but that does not mean that their use authorizes an intervention against a sovereign nation.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>Not responding to Syrian moves to use chemical weapons will be enabling the Syrian government to use chemical weapons. It has already been reported that some chemical weapons are being made ready for use such as the combining of the two chemical precursors, isopropanol and methylphosphony difluoride, needed to weaponize sarin gas. It means that &ldquo;Physically, they&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where the can load it up on a plane and drop it&rdquo;.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> If there is no response to this then Syria will be more likely to use weapons.</p>
<p>If there is no response to the limited use of chemical weapons, such as the use of Agent 15 in Homs, then there the regime will be encouraged to think that there will be no response to larger uses of chemical weapons. Syria would slowly escalate to see what it can get away with, an escalation that US officials think could &ldquo;lead to a mass-casualty event&rdquo; without the appropriate response.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>This is all supposition; we have no way of knowing if Syria will test any set red lines, or that they will use chemical weapons if there is no response. Instead it may be the response that causes the use of chemical weapons.

                    <p>One of the reasons why there has not been an intervention in Syria already is the difficulty of doing so. Preventing or limiting the use of chemical weapons however does represent a defined objective that is smaller, and therefore easier, than bringing peace to Syria. It however has to be accepted that if Assad’s regime is determined to use chemical weapons then some are likely to get through and how much is prevented is largely dependent on intelligence.</p><p>Interdicting chemical weapons during transport and bombing the storage facilities to make it much more difficult to move the weapons would be easiest to accomplish.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> But if chemical weapons are about to be used then attacking the delivery vehicles would be necessary; any intervention would have overwhelming air superiority so would prevent the option of aircraft and helicopters being used to deliver the weapons.</p><p>More difficult to destroy are ballistic missiles, and particularly artillery<a href="/print/47098#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> but even these are much easier to hit than infantry would be. In the conflict against Gaddafi successfully used precision guided weapons to destroy tanks and artillery.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Moreover an intervening force would not need to destroy every missile and artillery brigade only find those that are being issued with chemical weapons. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="/print/47098#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Eisenstadt, Michael, ‘Chemical Reaction’, <em>Foreign Policy</em>, 18 January 2013, <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/18/chemical_reaction">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/18/chemical_reaction</a></p><div><div><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/47098#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Fargo, Matthew, ‘Targeting Syria’s Chemical Weapons – A Dangerous Proposition’, <em>Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies</em>, 25 July 2012, <a href="http://csis.org/blog/targeting-syrias-chemical-weapons-dangerous-proposition">http://csis.org/blog/targeting-syrias-chemical-weapons-dangerous-proposition</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/47098#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Hebert, Adam J., ‘Libya: Victory Through Airpower’, <em>Airforce-Magazine.com</em>, December 2011, <a href="http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2011/December%202011/1211edit.aspx">http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2011/December%202011/1211edit.aspx</a></p></div></div></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Attacking chemical weapons stores prevents a threat in itself as it runs the risk of blowing up the weapons and therefore dispersing them into the air.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This risk would potentially be even higher with any biological weapons as they would not become harmless through dispersal as Chemical weapons would.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the risks of setting off the arsenals when attacking them such attacks would be very unlikely to be successful. While Syria&rsquo;s chemical weapons may be held in a few large centers this would seem to be unlikely given the history of attacks on unconventional weapons programs. Syria itself has had a nuclear weapons program destroyed as a result of an Israeli air attack in 2007.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This would have been a powerful lesson in the need to disperse these weapons to prevent their destruction from the air.</p>

                    <p>Chemical and biological weapons are among the most horrifying weapons ever created by man; it is with good cause that they are banned. However if there have already been 60,000<a href="/print/47098#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> people killed by the conflict in Syria then would the use of chemical weapons, unless it was on a massive scale, would not make much difference in terms of the numbers of people the Assad regime is killing.<a href="/print/47098#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> It is morally inconsistent to consider chemical weapons somehow different if they are not changing the scale of the killing. It is human lives that matter, or rather does not matter as has been made clear by the unwillingness to do anything, not the type of weapon that kill those people. If Syria kills a few thousand more by using chemical weapons then what is the difference to killing thousands more using conventional weapons?</p>

                    <p>All killing is abhorrent and one life is worth as much as any other. But while the lives lost are the same it is not true that the use of chemical weapons to kill is the same as conventional weapons; the difference is that one is banned and the other is not, their use makes intervention possible in a way it is not during a conventional conflict. The threat from chemical weapons is also of an order of magnitude greater than that of conventional weapons. They can kill immense numbers quickly and indiscriminately.&nbsp; The use of chemical weapons is an escalation that must not be allowed to happen.&nbsp;</p>
