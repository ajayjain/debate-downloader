    <h1 class="print-title">This House would expand the United Nations Security Council</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The Security Council is the key organ of the United Nations with primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. It has the power to establish peacekeeping missions, impose international sanctions, and can authorise military action against a sovereign state. Currently it consist of fifteen members, five of them (UK, USA, France, Russia and China) are permanent members that hold a special veto power over all non-procedural decisions in the Council. The other ten are elected for two-year terms. Directly after World War 2 the Security Council had eleven members; after the amendment of the UN Charter in 1963 the number of non-permanent members was increased from six to ten but no other substantial changes were made. Since the first reform in the sixties no other reforms have been made, although the world today has changed drastically from the world just after Second World War.</p>
<p>The question of equitable representation in the Security Council has been on the General Assembly agenda since 1979, when a number of mostly developing countries raised the issue of under-representation of developing and non-aligned countries in the Security Council. Although the topic of the reform of the Security Council was opened already in the late seventies there was no extensive debate until the 1990s. The 1980s were still an era marked by antagonism between East and West and due to the large economic problems of developing countries their influence and that of the non-aligned movement decreased. At that time there was no general support for major reform, since all the permanent members, except for China, opposed any expansion vigorously.</p>
<p>While the 1980s were perhaps still an inconvenient time for the discussion, the atmosphere dramatically changed in the nineties. The Security Council has become much more active after the end of the Cold war and has therefore attracted more attention and consequently also criticism. Today it seems to be universally acknowledged that some sort of reform is needed and urgent but there is no consensus on what this reform should look like. There are several models debated, some of them propose expansion only in the non-permanent category, others a third category of members that would have longer terms but no veto power. The most supported models envisage increases in both the permanent and non-permanent categories. One of them is the so-called Razali proposal that adds 5 permanent (Germany, Japan, one from Africa, one from Asia, one from Latin America) and 4 non-permanent seats (one for Asia, Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe) to the existing Council, increasing the total number of members to 24. This proposal enjoys the widest support, yet it has not gained the sufficient number of votes required by the UN Charter (two-thirds of UN members, including all five permanent members are needed for any Charter amendments). The arguments below discuss the pros and cons of a plan to expand membership in both permanent and non-permanent categories.</p>
<p>Furthermore due to the increased activity of the EU in foreign policy areas, the question has arisen, triggering new debates, whether the EU should get a permanent seat on the UNSC, replacing France and the UK who would lose their permanent seats. The possible changes in the UN Security council and the eventual consequences of them are object of the current debate.</p>

                    <p>The current Security Council doesn’t reflect the economic reality of the 21st century. France and Great Britain have clearly lost their position among the most powerful nations and their role was long ago taken over by Germany and Japan. They are the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> world economies. Furthermore these two countries are the second and third largest contributors to the UN budget and deserve a permanent seat in the Council. Moreover, as permanent members pay an extra share for their seat, Japan and Germany’s contributions would bring considerable amounts to the UN budget – “The three largest contributors to the United Nations, the US (22.000% of the UN budget), Japan (12.530%) and Germany (8.018%) thus together finance some 43% of the entire UN budget.” [1] Meanwhile Brazil and India have emerged as major economies and stable democracies over the past decade, and deserve recognition for their global importance.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;Contributions to the United Nations budget&nbsp;<a href="http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Aussenpolitik/Friedenspolitik/VereinteNationen/StrukturVN/Finanzen/Uebersicht.html">http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Aussenpolitik/Friedenspolitik/VereinteNationen/StrukturVN/Finanzen/Uebersicht.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Giving Germany a permanent seat would hardly be a step forward in an endeavour for a more equitable distribution of seats in the Council. The UK and France hold a veto power over any amendments and aren’t willing to give up their seats, so adding Germany would mean that the EU would have three permanent seats in the Council. That wouldn’t be a fair geographical distribution and wouldn’t, for that matter, be a equitable distribution either.</p><p>Japan in particular is not as deserving as has been suggested; although it is rich Japan has been struggling economically for a decade while other countries (including the UK and France) have continued to grow. The Japanese economy has been recently hit by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and Fukushima nuclear disaster “Before Japan's 2011 earthquake, its economy was just starting to emerge from its deepest recession since the 1970s(…)Japan's economy is still challenged by rising commodity prices -- the country imports most of its food and oil -- and a shrinking labor pool, as its population ages. Japan's worst challenge is a national debt that is twice as big as its annual economic output.” [1]</p><p>Compared to other nations, both Germany and Japan are military insignificant. Germany spends only 1.27% of its GDP on military defence, in comparison to 2.32% for UK and France. [2] This is important as the Permanent 5's status currently reflects great power realities - they are the countries most able to project power abroad and so have the ability to implement (or block) UN security decisions.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;Amadeo, Kimberly.

                    <p>At the moment many countries are not heard in the council and some states may never gain a chance of being elected to the Security Council. This leaves billions of the world's population without representation in the world's highest body. How can India with over a sixth of the world's population be left out? Security Council expansion would make the UN much more democratic as there would be more participants representing more of the people of the world present in closed meetings and informal consultations. Expansion would increase the transparency and therefore the accountability of the Council – something that even countries sometimes considered to be against democracy believe is necessary “he (Seyed Mohammad Ali Mottaghi Nejad) said Iran believed that the links between the issues comprised the “basic objective” of a comprehensive reform towards a Council that was more democratic, inclusive, equitably representative, transparent, effective and accountable.&nbsp;“ [1]</p><p>[1] 'Concluding Annual Debate on Security Council Reform, General Assembly', 12/11/2010, &nbsp;<a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/ga11023.doc.htm">http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/ga11023.doc.htm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Expansion is not the right way to increase transparency, as the number of informal consultations of smaller groups (such as permanent members or only industrialised permanent members) in order to try and push though resolutions would probably rise. Reforms to enhance transparency and improve working methods are already taking place – At a 19 July 2007 informal meeting of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on an Increase in Membership of the Security Council, some suggested a more analytical report that would, among other things, provide rationales for the Council's major decisions.

                    <p>This could mean that the council ends up deadlocked more often than not as was the case during the Cold war when the two blocs almost always opposed each other. Up until 1991 (from the UN founding in 1946) there were only 700 security council resolutions due to the deadlocked nature of the council. In the 20 years since there have been over 1300 resolutions.<sup>1</sup> The negotiation process would also be significantly longer.

                    <p>In 1945 there were only 51 UN members, so eleven Council members were adequately representing all voices. Today the UN membership has risen to almost four times the number of the original one, yet there are only fifteen voices in the Council. This means that there are many countries who do not have anyone on the security council that has similar priorities to them, their views may well be unrepresented.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Reforming the UN Security Council is very difficult as no one can agree which new powers deserve representation, whether they should have a veto, and even whether permanent membership should continue to exist in any form. Japan and India seem obvious candidates for permanent status, but their candidacies are fiercely opposed by a variety of other Asian countries, while Nigeria and Egypt both feel they have a good claim to an "African" seat. The EU also considers it deserves a separate place. Furthermore Brazil as a very fast developing country and turning into a world power claims it also has a right in the UNSC as a permanent member. All these different demands opinions make an eventual reform or expansion of the UNSC very hard to achieve.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is widely recognised that the current Security Council set-up lacks legitimacy and requires reform. Major states such as Japan, and rising powers such as Brazil, South Africa and India deserve recognition and giving them permanent status would provide representation for a much broader cross-section of humanity. It maybe hard to achieve consensus on what exactly to be the change in the UNSC, but the new international environment requests that. This is supported by a lot of leading politicians and leaders in a global aspect. "The United States is open to UN Security Council reform and expansion, as one element of an overall agenda for UN reform" <sup>1</sup>"The UN must rationally adapt itself to new world realities. It should also strengthen its influence and preserve its multinational nature and integrity of the UN Charter provisions.

                    <p>In regards to an eventual separate place on the UNSC for the European Union – the EU might be an economic powerhouse and might want to coordinate foreign relations in regards to external economic policy, but at heart it is intended to be an economic union, not a political union. Most of its founding treaties and the daily workings of its institutions focus on creating and maintaining a single market, not on creating a shared foreign and military policy. Giving the EU representation at what is an institution for foreign and military policy is misreading what the EU was intended to be.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The EU might function as an economic union, but its original goal was to prevent war from ever happening again on the European continent. Economic integration is a means to this goal, by making member states economically too dependent on each other for them to want to declare war on each other. Given this history, the EU can contribute a lot of knowledge and experience on how to use ‘soft power’ in a foreign policy context, and given its goal of (and success in) creating everlasting peace on the continent, it should have a seat at the world’s foremost foreign policy institution. Furthermore the EU is ever closer to a political union – “German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said his country is willing to discuss greater harmonisation of eurozone tax policy, adding that the next decade is likely to see Europe take significant steps towards closer political union.” [1] Therefore it is simply a normal step for the EU to have a say in the international affairs.</p><p>[1] Willis, Andrew.

Four out of five permanent members are industrialized and four out of five are “European”. The four-fifths of humankind that live in developing countries have only one spokesman among the permanent five. Giving Africa, Asia and Latin America a permanent seat is a step forward in North-South balance – “Currently, four out of five veto-bearing members are industrialized countries and the fifth, China, is rapidly approaching industrialized status. Many in the rest of the world seethe at their exclusion from this elite group. Africa, Latin America, and the Islamic world, for example, have no permanent voice on the council. Without a voice, it is understandable why many countries are unwilling to send troops or aid whenever the Security Council demands it. This imbalance, highlighted by the Iraq war, has made Security Council reform a hot topic of debate.” [1]</p><p>[1]&nbsp;) Teng, Michael.

The permanent seats for France and the UK are based on the fact that they were among the great powers and victors of World War II.
