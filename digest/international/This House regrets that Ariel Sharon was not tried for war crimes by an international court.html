    <h1 class="print-title">This House regrets that Ariel Sharon was not tried for war crimes by an international court</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Ariel Sharon, who was prime minister of Israel from 2001 to 2006, died on the 11<sup>th</sup> of January 2014, after eight years in a persistent vegetative state due to a massive stroke. Sharon, who held positions in Israeli governance since 1981, was a highly important figure &ndash; but also a highly controversial one. To his supporters, he has been described as the &ldquo;architect of Israel<a href="/print/69878#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&rdquo;, and a man who aimed to create a peaceful and sustainable Israel<a href="/print/69878#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. To his opponents, he was a butcher and a war criminal.</p>
<p>Initially a member of the pre-independence paramilitary group Haganah, which formed the core of the nascent IDF when it was formed in 1948, he rose to the rank of major-general, taking part in the 1948 conflict (referred to as the War of Independence by Israelis and the al-Nakba &ndash; the catastrophe &ndash; by the Palestinians and others) which lead to the independence and recognition of the State of Israel, the Suez crisis, the Six-Day War in 1967 in which Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank and Golan Heights, and the 1973 conflict known variously as the Yom Kippur War or the October War. This included leadership of Unit 101, created in 1953 under orders by then prime minister David Ben-Gurion to carry out reprisal operations<a href="/print/69878#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. In October 1953, Israeli troops under Sharon&rsquo;s control attacked Qibya, a village in the West Bank, in which 69 people, mostly women and children, were killed. This was an act of retaliation following attacks from the West Bank in which Israelis were targeted: Sharon wrote in his diary that he was ordered to make the attack &ldquo;an example for everyone&rdquo;<a href="/print/69878#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. These actions were condemned by the UN Security Council<a href="/print/69878#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Entering electoral politics in 1973 as a member of the Israeli legislature, the Knesset, for Likud, he became the security adviser of PM Yitzhak Rabin, he had a spell between 1981 and 1983 as Minister of Defence, during which Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, parts of which were occupied until 1985.</p>
<p>During the conflict, Kataeb, a Lebanese Christian militia, lead a massacre of civilians (between 762 and 3,500) in the Sabra area of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, and the nearby Shalita refugee camp while the IDF prevented those in the areas from leaving. In addition to a UN commission (and a general assembly vote deeming it an act of genocide<a href="/print/69878#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>), an Israeli inquiry, the Kahan commission, deemed Sharon responsible. He resigned as minister of defence, but remained in government, becoming foreign minister in 1999. He was elected as Prime Minister in 2001, during his term creating a new party, Kadima. While Prime Minister, he lead a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip.</p>

                    <p>In addition to events mentioned in the introduction, Sharon was accused of, along with troops under his command, execution-style killings of 49 Egyptian civilians taken prisoner by the IDF in the Saini peninsula in 1956<a href="/print/69878#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> - wilful killing of civilians being a war crime as per the Fourth Geneva Convention.</p>
<p>The purpose of international criminal law is that individuals are brought to trial to ensure that individuals are held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity: if a person isn&rsquo;t prosecuted, either by a domestic or international court, the credibility of the limits civilized nations place on war is eroded.</p>

                    <p>It is up to sovereign states to deal with their own criminality, not that of international courts. Israel decided Sharon had nothing to answer for. There have been commissions into some of his actions; the Khan Commission of Inquiry looked into the massacre at Sabra and Shatilla and concluded that &ldquo;blunders constitute the non-fulfillment of a duty with which the Defense Minister was charged.&rdquo; Sharon was only indirectly responsible.<a href="/print/69878#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>

                    <p>By prosecuting perpetrators, justice creates a deterrent. The deterrent effect, as accepted in criminal law generally, is likely to make the peace more long standing and stable in the future &ndash; it will make those minded to perform atrocities think again. If those who committed atrocities &lsquo;get away with it&rsquo; they will be much more likely to plunge the country back into violence. If Sharon was prosecuted for his crimes in the 50s, would he have gone on to have the same political career? He would likely not have had the chance to allow the Sabra and Shatia massacre or Operation Defensive Shield.<a href="/print/69878#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
<p>The career of Laurent Nkunda is a good example of this; he fought in the Tutsi group that took control of Rwanda in 1994 ending the genocide and then was a rebel commander in both Congolese civil wars in which he was accused of atrocities before launching his own rebellion, only now after 14 years as an army commander is he under arrest<a href="/print/69878#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Clearly Nkunda being locked up at some stage would have been better than regularly negotiating with him to try and create peace.</p>

                    <p>This fails for two reasons. Firstly, prosecutions are not always a deterrent to future crimes. Secondly that justice is not necessary in all cases to prevent recidivism &ndash; justice has not been needed in many cases, such as in Haiti after the 2004 coup, Haiti&rsquo;s subsequent problems being caused by natural disasters.</p>
<p>Even if Sharon were to be brought to trial before an international tribunal, the Israeli state apparatus would be able to carry on with a new leader, rendering the exercise futile in trying to stop the conflict. A prosecution would not have brought peace it would simply entrench the Israeli position.</p>
