    <h1 class="print-title">This House would drop the sanctions against Cuba.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Fidel Castro and his Communist government came to power in Cuba in 1959, much to the horror of the American administration of the time. Cuba was supported throughout the Cold War by the Soviet Union and became a flashpoint for Cold War tensions, notably during the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis when Nikita Khrushchev sparked the most dangerous Cold War confrontation by attempting to place nuclear weapons on the island.</p><p>America has maintained near total sanctions on Cuba throughout the period since 1959, but before 1990 they were largely counteracted in their effects by the weight of support, trade and subsidy offered by the USSR, which amounted to $4-6 Billion dollars per year.<a href="/print/17865#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Since the collapse of the Soviet Bloc the withdrawal of these subsidies caused a 35% drop in GDP, which was partly reversed after late 1990s market reforms that focused on foreign investment and tourism, as well as allowing some self-employment but living conditions remain below 1989 levels. &nbsp;After 2000 some of these tentative reforms were rolled back, while Cuba began to benefit from its alliance with Venezuela, which gives it oil in exchange for doctors and teachers. Fidel Castro stepped down from formal power in 2006, handing over to his brother who has recently announced further liberalising economic reforms, while political control has been maintained.<a href="/print/17865#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>Nevertheless, the poverty of Cuba makes it much more vulnerable to the effects of sanctions than it was. The decreased threat of communism has led to a re-evaluation of the sanctions in the US but so far the wounds of the twentieth century, and the electoral significance of Florida, where most Cuban émigrés live, has steeled the resolve of the White House. Sanctions were in fact strengthened significantly in the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, although some food and medicines were still allowed through under the Bush administration. Announcements by the Obama administration in 2011 should make it easier for US citizens to travel to Cuba and to send remittances to relatives there, and have been much criticised by opposition politicians and some Cuban-American lobby groups.</p><div><a href="/print/17865#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Giscard, John C., ‘U.S.-Cuba Relations: Revisiting the Sanctions Policy’, 2002, p.27. <a href="http://dodreports.com/pdf/ada405054.pdf">http://dodreports.com/pdf/ada405054.pdf</a></div><div><a href="/print/17865#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> U.S. Department of State, ‘Background Note: Cuba’, 2011. <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2886.htm">http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2886.htm</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-userreference field-field-editors">

                    <p>The sanctions cause real and unacceptable harm to the Cuban people. Sanctions deprive Cuba of low cost food that the United States could provide so hitting the poorest yet they do not affect the ruling elite.<a href="/print/17865#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In the 1990’s Cuba lost $70 billion in trade<a href="/print/17865#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> and $1.2 billion in international loans because of U.S. sanctions. Cuba is too poor a country not to suffer from these losses. The dominance of America in the pharmaceuticals industry, moreover, means that it is actually impossible for Cubans to gain access to many drugs and other medical equipment, including the only curative treatment for some pediatric leukemias.<a href="/print/17865#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> America would be the natural market for most Cuban products, and its refusal to accept goods with even the tiniest Cuban inputs from third nations damages Cuba’s ability to trade with others. Other South American countries have shown their reliance on the types of loans that Cuba is denied in the last few years to keep their economies on track.</p><div><a href="/print/17865#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Griswold, Daniel, ‘Four Decades of Failure: The U.S. Embargo against Cuba’, 2005. <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10921">http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10921</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17865#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> United Nations Secretary General, ‘Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba’, United Nations General Assembly, Fifty-seventh session, 26 July 2002, <a href="http://www.cubaminrex.cu/bloqueo/Eng/Anexos/A%2057%20264.pdf">http://www.cubaminrex.cu/bloqueo/Eng/Anexos/A%2057%20264.pdf</a> P.11</p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17865#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Garfield, Richard, ‘The Impact of the Economic Crisis and the US Embargo on Health in Cuba’, <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>, Vol.87, No. 1, January 1997, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1380757/pdf/amjph00500-0017.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1380757/pdf/amjph00500-0017.pdf</a> P.18</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Sanctions didn’t cause the economic failure in Cuba. The communist political and economic system has been shown to lead to economic collapse all over the world, whether sanctions are in place or not. Centralization, collectivism, state control, bureaucracy, and restrictions on private initiative totalitarian style economic policies are what are to blame for the Cuban people’s economic suffering.<a href="/print/17865#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Even if sanctions were lifted, lack of private ownership, foreign exchange and tradable commodities would hold Cuba back.

Its economic effect is to make the people of Cuba worse off by depriving them of lower-cost food and other goods that could be bought from the United States. It means less independence for Cuban workers and entrepreneurs, who could be earning dollars from American tourists and fueling private-sector growth. Meanwhile, Castro and his ruling elite enjoy a comfortable, insulated lifestyle by extracting any meager surplus produced by their captive subjects.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Counterargument:</strong></p>
<p>Peters, Philip, &lsquo;U.S. Sanctions against Cuba: A Just War Perspective&rsquo;, <a href="http://www.ascecuba.org/publications/proceedings/volume16/pdfs/peters.pdf">http://www.ascecuba.org/publications/proceedings/volume16/pdfs/peters.pdf</a> &quot;With respect to Cuba, it must be said that Cuba&#39;s economy is shaped fundamentally by Cuban economic policies, not the U.S. embargo. Centralization, collectivism, state control, bureaucracy, and restrictions on private initiative are fundamentally to blame for the hardships that many Cubans face in their daily lives. However, while the U.S. embargo plays second fiddle, it does add to the hardships. Travel is but one example. Across Cuba one observes that spending by foreign travelers generates jobs with higher-than-average pay in the state tourist enterprises, in thousands of small private businesses that operate legally (home rentals, artisans, restaurants, taxis), and among Cubans who engage in enterprise without licenses. American travelers would dramatically expand this varied, high-income sector, to the benefit of many thousands of Cuban families.&quot;</p>

<p>Griswold, Daniel, &lsquo;Four Decades of Failure: The U.S. Embargo against Cuba&rsquo;, 2005 <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10921">http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10921</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Double Standard on Sanctions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economic sanctions rarely work. Trade and investment sanctions against Burma, Iran, and North Korea have failed to change the behavior of any of those oppressive regimes; sanctions have only deepened the deprivation of the very people we are trying to help. Our research at the Cato Institute confirms that trade and globalization till the soil for democracy. Nations open to trade are more likely to be democracies where human rights are respected. Trade and the development it creates give people tools of communication-cell phones, satellite TV, fax machines, the Internet-that tend to undermine oppressive authority. Trade not only increases the flow of goods and services but also of people and ideas. Development also creates a larger middle class that is usually the backbone of democracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Bush seems to understand this powerful connection between trade and democracy when he talks about China or the Middle East. In a speech on trade early in his first term, the president noted that trade was about more than raising incomes. &quot;Trade creates the habits of freedom,&#39; the president said, and those habits begin &quot;to create the expectations of democracy and demands for better democratic institutions. Societies that open to commerce across their borders are more open to democracy within their borders. And for those of us who care about values and believe in values--not just American values, but universal values that promote human dignity--trade is a good way to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president has rightly opposed efforts in Congress to impose trade sanctions against China because of its poor human rights record. In sheer numbers, the Chinese government has jailed and killed far more political and religious dissenters than has the Cuban government. And China is arguably more of a national security concern today than Castro&#39;s pathetic little workers&#39; paradise. Yet China has become our third largest trading partner while we maintain a blanket embargo on commercial relations with Cuba. President Bush understands that economic engagement with China offers the best hope for encouraging human rights and political reforms in that country, yet he has failed to apply that same, sound thinking to Cuba.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the Venezuelan government of Hugo Chavez is doing more to undermine America&#39;s national interest today than either Cuba or China. Chavez shares Castro&#39;s hatred for democratic capitalism, but unlike Castro he has the resources and money to spread his influence in the hemisphere. Chavez is not only bankrolling Cuba with discounted oil but he is also supporting anti-Americans movements in Nicaragua and other countries in our neighborhood. Yet we buy billions of dollars of oil a year from Venezuela&#39;s state oil company, we allow huge Venezuelan investments in our own energy sector, and Americans--last time I checked--can travel freely to Venezuela. The one big difference between Venezuela and Cuba is that we don&#39;t have half a million politically active Venezuelan exiles living in a swing state like Ohio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not an argument for an embargo against Venezuela, but for greater coherence in U.S. foreign policy. In a world still inhabited by a number of unfriendly and oppressive regimes, there is simply nothing special about Cuba that warrants the drastic option of a total embargo.&quot;</p>

He can rail for hours about the suffering the embargo inflicts on Cubans, even though the damage done by his domestic policies is far worse. If the embargo were lifted, the Cuban people would be a bit less deprived and Castro would have no one else to blame for the shortages and stagnation that will persist without real market reforms.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cuban families are not the only victims of the embargo. Many of the dollars Cubans could earn from U.S. tourists would come back to the United States to buy American products, especially farm goods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2000, Congress approved a modest opening of the embargo. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows cash-only sales to Cuba of U.S. farm products and medical supplies. The results of this opening have been quite amazing. Since 2000, total sales of farm products to Cuba have increased from virtually zero to $380 million last year. From dead last in U.S. farm export markets, Cuba ranked 25th last year out of 228 countries in total purchases of U.S. farm products. Cuba is now the fifth largest export market in Latin America for U.S. farm exports. American farmers sold more to Cuba last year than to Brazil. Our leading exports to Cuba are meat and poultry, rice, wheat, corn, and soybeans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American Farm Bureau estimates that Cuba could eventually become a $1 billion agricultural export market for products of U.S. farmers and ranchers. The embargo stifles another $250 million in potential annual exports of fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides and tractors. According to a study by the U.S. International Trade Commission, the embargo costs American firms a total of $700 million to $1.2 billion per year. Farmers in Texas and neighboring states are among the biggest potential winners. One study by Texas A&amp;M University estimated that Texas ranks fifth among states in potential farm exports to Cuba, with rice, poultry, beef and fertilizer the top exports.&quot;</p>
<p>Argument Five: Griswold, Daniel, &lsquo;Four Decades of Failure: The U.S. Embargo against Cuba&rsquo;, 2005, <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10921">http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10921</a>, &quot;each time efforts in Congress to ease the embargo have been thwarted by the administration and the Republican leadership. Support for the embargo certainly does not come from the general American public, but from a group of Cuban-American activists concentrated in southern Florida. By a fluke of the electoral college, Republican presidents feel obligated to please this small special interest at the expense of our broader national interest.&quot;</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch, &lsquo;Impediments to Human Rights in Cuban Law&rsquo;, 1999, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/cuba/Cuba996-03.htm">http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/cuba/Cuba996-03.htm</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The denial of basic civil and political rights is written into Cuban law. While Cuba&#39;s domestic legislation includes broad statements of fundamental rights, other provisions grant the state extraordinary authority to penalize individuals who attempt to enjoy their rights to free expression, opinion, association, and assembly. Cuban legislation also undercuts the right to a fair trial, by allowing the country&#39;s highest authorities to control the courts and prosecutors, granting broad authority for warrantless arrests and pretrial detentions, and restricting the right to a defense. Unfortunately, Cuban courts have failed to observe the few legal guarantees of due process available to defendants under the law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, rather than modify its laws to conform with international human rights standards, Cuba has approved legislation further restricting fundamental rights. Only a restoration of religious freedoms stands out as a notable exception to this trend. But Cuba has consistently refused to reform the most objectionable elements of its laws. Cuba&#39;s concurrent refusal to amnesty politicalprisoners and its continued prosecutions of nonviolent activists highlight the critical role of Cuba&#39;s laws in its machinery of repression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cuban Constitution</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cuban constitution guarantees &#39;the full freedom and dignity of men, [and] the enjoyment of their rights....&#39; However, multiple constitutional provisions undermine these guarantees. The constitution nullifies freedoms when they are contrary to &#39;the goals of the socialist State,&#39; &#39;socialist legality,&#39; or the &#39;people&#39;s decision to build socialism and communism.&#39; The breadth of these terms allows for arbitrary, politicized denials of fundamental rights. The constitution has been used to undermine international human rights treaties ratified by Cuba by providing that any treaty, pact, or concession that disregards or diminishes Cuba&#39;s &#39;territorial sovereignty&#39; is illegal and void.30 In international fora for the protection of human rights, Cuba often invokes sovereignty as a justification for non-compliance and non-cooperation.&quot;</p>

<p>Griswold, Daniel, &lsquo;Four Decades of Failure: The U.S. Embargo against Cuba&rsquo;, 2005 <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10921">http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10921</a>?, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our research at the Cato Institute confirms that trade and globalization till the soil for democracy. Nations open to trade are more likely to be democracies where human rights are respected. Trade and the development it creates give people tools of communication-cell phones, satellite TV, fax machines, the Internet-that tend to undermine oppressive authority. Trade not only increases the flow of goods and services but also of people and ideas. Development also creates a larger middle class that is usually the backbone of democracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Bush seems to understand this powerful connection between trade and democracy when he talks about China or the Middle East. In a speech on trade early in his first term, the president noted that trade was about more than raising incomes. &#39;Trade creates the habits of freedom,&#39; the president said, and those habits begin &#39;to create the expectations of democracy and demands for better democratic institutions. Societies that open to commerce across their borders are more open to democracy within their borders. And for those of us who care about values and believe in values--not just American values, but universal values that promote human dignity--trade is a good way to do that.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Counterargument</strong></p>
<p>Reeson, Greg, &lsquo;Time to Drop Sanctions Against Cuba&rsquo;, 2006 <a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/15758">http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/15758</a>,&nbsp; &quot;For economic sanctions to work against a particular state there has to be global consensus for their implementation. Sanctions imposed and enforced by one nation alone rarely have the desired effect because the sanctioned nation simply finds other trading partners to conduct economic activity. Too often, business opportunities and investment programs prevent countries from signing on to a sanctions regime, even though they may find the target country&rsquo;s behavior objectionable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take for instance the recent discussions in the United Nations Security Council over Iran&rsquo;s uranium enrichment activities. Despite a clear threat to regional peace and stability should Iran acquire nuclear weapons, Russia, France and China have thus far refused to go along with sanctions that would limit Iran&rsquo;s access to nuclear technology. All three nations have business interests in Iran and all three stand to lose money if sanctions are imposed. Even if the United States unilaterally imposed sanctions to supplement restrictions already in place, the effect on Iran&rsquo;s radical regime would be negligible at best.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Cuba, sanctions currently in place against the Castro regime are largely American, and as such are summarily ignored by most other nations. While Castro has certainly been deprived of American dollars, there has been no shortage of willing trade partners or arms suppliers for the communist dictatorship. Cuba has indeed experienced significant economic troubles since the collapse of the Soviet Union, but those fiscal woes are the result of losing the island nation&rsquo;s long-time economic and political sponsor and not the result of American economic sanctions.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Sanctions are a better alternative to military action. The most recent set of sanctions were imposed in 1996 in response to two US civilian planes belonging to the group of exiles ‘brothers of peace’ being shot down by the Cuban Air Force near Cuba.<a href="/print/17865#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The United States would have been justified in reacting proportionally with some military action but instead reinforced sanctions through the Helms-Burton Act.<a href="/print/17865#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> This shows that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of support for Cuba in 1991 did not mean an end to the threat posed by Cuba. Cuba has remained communist and the Castro regime has shown it is still willing to antagonize the United States. As Cuba is situated in a strategic location close to the United States the US government cannot be precipitate in removing sanctions at least until Cuba proves it is a good neighbour.</p><div><a href="/print/17865#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> University of Minnesota Human Rights Library, ‘Armando Alejandre Jr., Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena y Pablo Morales v.

                    <p>The national security rationale for sanctions on Cuba has long since disappeared. The embargo was originally imposed in 1960 when Castro seized US property in Cuba and was tightened in 1962 in response to Cuban alignment to the Soviet Union. These sanctions were in order to neutralize Cuba as a potential threat through it being a proxy of the Soviet Union. Since the Soviet Union has collapsed this is no longer a problem. Instead Cuba is left with no powerful friends and by itself its military power is negligible and is certainly in no position to threaten the world’s preeminent power.<a href="/print/17865#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17865#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Defense Intelligence Agency, ‘The Cuban Threat to U.S. National Security’, 1997. <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/dia/product/980507-dia-cubarpt.htm">http://www.fas.org/irp/dia/product/980507-dia-cubarpt.htm</a></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

<p>Defense Intelligence Agency, &lsquo;The Cuban Threat to U.S. National Security&rsquo;, 1997, <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/dia/product/980507-dia-cubarpt.htm">http://www.fas.org/irp/dia/product/980507-dia-cubarpt.htm</a>, The disintegration of the Soviet bloc in 1989 triggered a profound deterioration of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), transforming the institution from one of the most active militaries in the Third World into a stay-at-home force that has minimal conventional fighting ability.</p>
<ul>
<li>The end of Soviet economic and military subsidies forced Havana to cut the military&#39;s size and budget by about 50 percent after 1989.</li>
<li>In 1989 Cuba was the largest Latin American military on a per capita basis. Today the FAR is estimated to have about 50,000 to 65,000 regular troops and is comparable on an active duty per capita basis to countries like Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and El Salvador.</li>
<li>Severe resource shortages have forced the FAR to reduce training significantly.</li>
<li>A substantial portion of the FAR&#39;s military heavy equipment is in storage. Cannibalization of equipment is used sustain active duty equipment and make up for shortages of spare parts</li>
