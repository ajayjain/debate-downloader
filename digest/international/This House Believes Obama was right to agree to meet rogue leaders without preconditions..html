    <h1 class="print-title">This House Believes Obama was right to agree to meet rogue leaders without preconditions.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>During one of the democratic primary debates leading up the 2008 presidential election, then Senator Barack Obama was asked whether he would meet with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, and Cuba, without preconditions. Obama said that “I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this [the Bush] administration – is ridiculous.” His response drew criticisms from foreign policy commentators and political opponents, with Hillary Clinton deeming his response “irresponsible and naïve.<a href="/print/17888#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>” Others, however, hailed it as the advent of a new foreign policy of engagement, in stark contrast to what they saw as the diplomatic failure of the Bush years. Although President Obama has yet to sit down with any of the aforementioned leaders, he did reiterate his willingness to do so after he took office.<a href="/print/17888#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Should President Obama pursue this approach in his relations with “rogue nations”, or should preconditions be essential in earning them a spot at the negotiating table? With Iran allegedly developing nuclear weapons, Syria in turmoil, and nuclear North Korea experiencing a change in leadership, the answer to these questions is of the utmost importance for US foreign policy.</p><p><a href="/print/17888#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Klein, Rick. “Clinton: Obama ‘Irresponsible and Naïve”. <em>ABC News. </em>24 July 2007. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3409544&amp;page=1" title="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3409544&amp;page=1">http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3409544&amp;page=1</a></p><div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17888#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Borger, Julian. “Barack Obama: Administration willing to talk to Iran ‘without preconditions’.” <em>Guardian</em>. 21 January 2009. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/21/barack-obama-iran-negotiations" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/21/barack-obama-iran-negotiations">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/21/barack-obama-iran-negotiations</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>From its early days, the Obama administration has strived to change the tide of US foreign policy, by moving away from America’s unilateralism and dismissiveness of other nations.<a href="/print/17888#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Its treatment of its foes is a product of that same attitude. The general policy not to meet or negotiate without preconditions is akin to dangling a spot at the table like some sort of prize that foreign leaders need to work for. In international law, all states are sovereign and equal with no one having a right to interfere with other’s internal affairs. This means that all leaders should treat each other with respect and deference.</p><p><a href="/print/17888#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Harnden, Toby. “Barack Obama: ‘arrogant US has been dismissive’ to allies.”<em> The Telegraph. </em>3 April 2009. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/5100338/Barack-Obama-arrogant-US-has-been-dismissive-to-allies.html" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/5100338/Barack-Obama-arrogant-US-has-been-dismissive-to-allies.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/5100338/Barack-Oba...</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>While legally all the world’s leaders are equal, morally they are not. For decades, the US has been the standard of what it means to be a liberal democracy and have respect your citizens’ rights and liberties. That is not arrogance; it’s moral leadership. This is a vision that the US should aggressively promote in its foreign policy. The President of the United states should not meet as equals with tyrants and dictators who oppress their own people, and endanger world peace and security. Not unless these people give any indication they are even vaguely committed to moving toward some common goals.</p>        </div>

                    <p>No government is monolithic. In every regime there will be moderate forces willing to use diplomacy and negotiations and extremist elements that do not. By demanding that preconditions be fulfilled before a meeting, all power is given to the extremists. Israel-Palestine is an example of this. By often demanding that violence cease before negotiations can take place, the US and Israel give a veto over negotiations to Hamas, who are the perpetrators of violence. They get to decide if and when negotiations take place. Instead, the president of the United States should always try to engage and strengthen moderates within these regimes.</p>        </div>

Such tactics can also strengthen moderates. However, a meeting with the President is a powerful symbol, and it should only take place if either significant headway has been made, or if the leaders of these regimes are fully committed to negotiating, which they can prove by agreeing to preconditions.</p>        </div>

                    <p>That is true. But that is mostly the case with preconditions that are strategically flawed or an attempt at political gamesmanship, when a leader makes outrageous demands the other party cannot possibly meet in order to paint them as unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate. However, chosen carefully, preconditions can set talks and negotiations on the right course, and give a strong indication of the sincerity and commitment of both parties.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Preconditions are not about posturing or scoring some easy, early points. They play an essential diplomatic role. By agreeing to make some concessions before negotiations start in earnest, a ‘rogue state’ would signal its good faith in the negotiating process and its willingness to compromise and work diligently toward a common goal and reaching an agreement.
