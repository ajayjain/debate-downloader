    <h1 class="print-title">This House believes Israel should return to its pre-1967 borders</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The Six-Day War of 1967 was preceded by a period of high tension between Israel and its neighbours: In May 1967, President Nasser of Egypt received false reports from the Soviet Union that Israel was massing on the Syrian border. Nasser began massing his troops in the Sinai Peninsula on Israel&#39;s border (May 16), expelled the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) peacekeeping force from Gaza and Sinai (May 19), and took up UNEF positions at Sharm el-Sheikh, overlooking the Straits of Tiran. Israel reiterated declarations made in 1957 that any closure of the Straits would be considered an act of war, or a justification for war. Nasser declared the Straits closed to Israeli shipping on May. 22&ndash;23 On May 30, Jordan and Egypt signed a defence pact. The following day, at Jordan&#39;s invitation, the Iraqi army began deploying troops and armoured units in Jordan. They were later reinforced by an Egyptian contingent. On June 4 Israel made the decision to go to war. The next morning, Israel launched Operation Focus, a large-scale surprise air strike that was the opening of the Six-Day War. The outcome was a swift and decisive Israeli victory. Israel took effective control of the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. Opinions are still divided on whether Israel&#39;s attack was an act of aggression or a preemptive strike of a defensive nature. By June 10, Israel had completed its final offensive in the Golan Heights, and a ceasefire was signed the day after. Israel had seized the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, the West Bank of the Jordan River (including East Jerusalem), and the Golan Heights. Overall, Israel&#39;s territory grew by a factor of three, including about one million Arabs placed under Israel&#39;s direct control in the newly captured territories. Israel&#39;s strategic depth grew to at least 300 kilometers in the south, 60 kilometers in the east and 20 kilometers of extremely rugged terrain in the north, a security asset that would prove useful in the Yom Kippur War six years later. On June 19, 1967, the Israeli government voted unanimously to return the Sinai to Egypt and the Golan Heights to Syria in return for peace agreements. The Golans would have to be demilitarized and special arrangement would be negotiated for the Straits of Tiran. The government also resolved to open negotiations with King Hussein of Jordan regarding the Eastern border. The Israeli decision was to be conveyed to the Arab nations by the United States. In September, however, the Khartoum Arab Summit resolved that there would be &ldquo;no peace, no recognition and no negotiation with Israel.&rdquo; However, the Khartoum conference effectively marked a shift in the perception of the conflict by the Arab states away from one centered on the question of Israel&#39;s legitimacy toward one focusing on territories and boundaries. After Israeli conquest of these newly acquired &#39;territories,&#39; a large settlement effort was launched to secure Israel&#39;s permanent foothold. There are now hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers in these territories. The aftermath of the war is also of religious significance. Under Jordanian rule, Jews were effectively barred from visiting the Western Wall (even though Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreement demanded Israeli Jewish access to the Western Wall). Jewish holy sites were not maintained, and their cemeteries had been desecrated. After the annexation to Israel, each religious group was granted administration over its holy sites. Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1978, after the Camp David Accords, and disengaged from the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2005, though its army frequently re-enters Gaza for military operations and still retains control of border crossings, seaports and airports.&nbsp; Now, the Palestinians and other surrounding Arab states are calling for Israel to return to its pre-1967 borders as part of a larger peace settlement. Is this justified? Would Israel be wise to accept? The issue has become increasingly significant in recent years because a number of countries around the world have unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 borders. Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay and Ecuador are among them, and other countries around the world are expected to follow, helping press the issue and the debate forward. The United States has consistently condemned such diplomatic recognition, and has remained hostile or cool to the idea of returning to the 1967 borders.</p>

                    <p>Because Israel won the land during war, it is considered occupied territory under international law, and it is illegal for Israel to annex it.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In July 2004, the International Court of Justice delivered an Advisory Opinion observing that under customary international law as reflected in Article 42 of the Regulations annexed to the Hague IV Convention, territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised. Israel raised a number of exceptions and objections, but the Court found them unpersuasive. The Court ruled that territories had been occupied by the Israeli armed forces in 1967, during the conflict between Israel and Jordan, and that subsequent events in those territories, had done nothing to alter the situation.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Even the Israeli Supreme court has ruled that &ldquo;Judea and Samaria [a.k.a. The West Bank] areas are held by the State of Israel in belligerent occupation.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18648#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Therefore, Israel has no better claim to these lands than that it won them in a war, which is an illegitimate claim under international law, and also illegitimate as a thinly-disguised, morally abhorrent &ldquo;might makes right&rdquo; argument. The fact that Arab states initiated the 1967 war does not justify Israel responding by annexing Palestinian territory.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> A just settlement would have been a return to the previous borders in exchange for security guarantees, etc. Instead, Israel unjustly used the opportunity to take land from an innocent people. One bad act does not justify another bad act in return. Moreover, it is notable that the nations which Israel took Gaza and the West Bank from in 1967 (Egypt and Jordan, respectively) were not representative nations of the areas&#39; majority inhabitants, the Palestinian people.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> It is thus illegitimate for Israel to claim ownership of Palestinian land because it defeated non-Palestinian nations in a war, and Israel should therefore return to its pre-1967 borders, leaving Gaza and the West Bank to the Palestinian people.</p>

                    <p>Israel won the 1967 war, even though this tiny nation was up against numerous Arab nations that aggressively initiated the conflict.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It had and has a right, therefore, to govern territory it rightfully fought and died for. All land held by any nation was gained through conflict at one time or another; the Palestinian people came to be in possession of their land in the West Bank through the Arab Conquests of the 7th Century.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Why&nbsp; are Israel&#39;s conquests any less legitimate, especially seeing as Israel took this land in self-defence and has kept only the land it needs for its continuing security? Moreover, hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens now live in settlements beyond the 1967 borders, and Israel has both the right and responsibility to protect their lives and homes by continuing to hold this territory.</p>

                    <p>The Palestinian people since 1967 have demonstrated through resistance to Israeli occupation their desire for an independent state of their own.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Throughout the years polls have consistently showed respectable Palestinian majorities in favour of a negotiated two-state settlement, which would offer them an independent state as well as allowing Israel to continue to exist as an independent state alongside the new Palestinian nation.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Israel&#39;s refusal to withdraw to the 1967 borders means that the majority of Palestinian people are compelled to live under the control of a state they do not wish to be a part of, a violation of their right to self-determination under international law. The 1993 Vienna Declaration, which reaffirmed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Charter (and so sets the standard in current international law), unequivocally gives all peoples the right to self-determination: &ldquo;All people have the right to self-determination. Owing to this right they freely establish their political status and freely provide their economic, social and cultural development...World Conference on Human Rights considers refusal of the right to self-determination as a violation of human rights and emphasizes the necessity of effective realization of this right&rdquo;.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in 2006 that the pre-1967 borders uphold the &ldquo;legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people for a secure, united, democratic and economically viable state coexisting peacefully with Israel.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18648#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> By this measure, the Palestinian majority in the occupied territories have the right to self-determination (by democratic processes), and Israel&#39;s suppression of that right through its refusal to withdraw to the 1967 borders should be seen as a human rights violation. Consequently, Israel should withdraw to its 1967 borders in order to end its violation of the rights of the Palestinian people.</p>

                    <p>Self-determination is not an absolute right. Not every territory and region in the world that seeks independence has the right to it. This is due in no small part to the fact that such a system would be unworkable. Certain criteria must be met for a territory and people to obtain a legitimate right to self-determination, including not compromising the fundamental security or territorial integrity of the original state, which a Palestinian state created through Israel withdrawing to its 1967 borders arguably, would do. Moreover, it is possible for Israel to withdraw from most of the West Bank, as it has offered to do in the past, while keeping some strategically essential land. This would allow for Palestinian self-determination whilst falling short of falling back totally to the 1967 borders.</p>

                    <p>If Israel were to withdraw to its 1967 borders, the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) would recognise Israel as legitimate within its remaining territories and end the conflict. In October 2010 Senior Palestine Liberation Organization official Yasser Abed Rabbo said that the Palestinians will be willing to recognize the State of Israel in any way that it desires, if the Americans would only present a map of the future Palestinian state that includes all of the territories captured in 1967, including East Jerusalem. &ldquo;We want to receive a map of the State of Israel which Israel wants us to accept. If the map will be based on the 1967 borders and will not include our land, our houses and East Jerusalem, we will be willing to recognize Israel according to the formulation of the government within the hour... Any formulation [presented to us] &ndash; even asking us to call Israel the &#39;Chinese State&#39; &ndash; we will agree to it, as long as we receive the 1967 borders &rdquo; added Rabbo.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Even Ismail Haniyeh, leader of the more extreme Hamas organisation, has said Hamas will accept a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders and will offer Israel a &ldquo;long term truce&rdquo; if it withdraws accordingly.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Significant international support for Israel withdrawing to the 1967 borders also exists, even from states with a&nbsp; history of hostility with Israel such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, who have made such a withdrawal a precondition of peace and recognition talks with Israel.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a><a href="/print/18648#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Even then-Israeli Prime Miniser Ehud Olmert acknowledged in 2008 that &ldquo;almost all&rdquo; of the territory seized during the Six-Day War in 1967 will have to be given back to the Palestinians return for peace.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> Therefore Israel should withdraw to its 1967 borders as this would bring peace and security to Israel by ending the conflict with the Palestinians and neighbouring states.</p>

                    <p>Simply withdrawing to its 1967 borders would not end the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Violence between Israelis and Palestinians long pre-dates the 1967 war. The 1967 war itself was caused by the fact that even an Israel within its 1967 borders was hated by neighbouring states for existing.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Palestinian support for two-state solution, even one where Israel withdrew to its 1967 borders declined around 2008, and is waning even among the &#39;moderate&#39; Palestinian camp, as well as among additional Arab elements.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Regarding Hamas, the reason it speaks only of &ldquo;long term truces&rdquo; with Israel and not peace is because it only wishes to make a deal allowing it to grow strong enough to eventually destroy the Israeli state, not to make permanent peace.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> It is also naïve to think that an Israeli state existing within its 1967 borders would gain the favour or even support of Iran. Iran wants to be the dominant power in the Middle East, and any form of Israeli state is a threat to this. Iran has a history of supporting violent Islamist terrorist groups dedicated to Israel&#39;s destruction, such as Hamas and Hezbollah.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> The political futures of Syria and Egypt are also uncertain, due to the unrest of the 2011 &#39;Arab Spring&#39;, and it is not beyond the realm of possibility that both could come under the sway of Islamist groups seek Israel&#39;s total destruction.</p>

                    <p>Israel has been the victim of multiple major illegal wars of aggression on the part of the Arab world, most notably in 1948 and 1967. These wars invalidate any special claim made by Arabs and Palestinians to pre-1967 territory, and justify Israel in keeping as much territory as is necessary to secure itself against these hostile states. Israel could have gone much further and taken more territory than it did in 1967 (as it was easily winning the war), but instead it restricted itself to only taking the territory that was necessary for it to create security buffer.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> When peace deals have allowed Israel to improve its security through giving up land historically, it has done so, for example when it returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt in 1982 in exchange for a peace treaty with Egypt, or when Israel returned the small swath of Jordanian territory it held when King Hussain of Jordan wanted to make peace. To date, Israel has withdrawn from approximately 93 percent of the territories it captured. In return for peace with Syria and an end to Palestinian terror, it is prepared to withdraw from most of the remaining 7% in dispute, although not all. Israel remains committed to trading land for peace, and never annexed the West Bank or Gaza Strip because it expected to return part of these territories in negotiations. When the Palestinians finally declared that they would recognize Israel and renounce terrorism, Israel agreed to begin to withdraw. Since 1993, Israel has turned over approximately 80% of the Gaza Strip and more than 40% of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority. Thus, Israel&#39;s objection is not so much against returning any of the land captured in 1967, but against returning absolutely all of it and going back completely to the 1967 borders, as this would mean giving up territories vital for Israel&#39;s security. The minimal slivers of territory that Israel it seeks to maintain through a peace settlement (after returning 90% of the pre-1967 territory), is very important to its national security as it offers a buffer against future Arab wars of aggression. This why Ehud Olmert stressed that only most of the occupied territory could be returned. He still argued that some had to be kept for security reasons: &ldquo;We can never totally return to the indefensible pre-1967 borders, ... We simply cannot afford to make Israel [9 miles] wide again at its center. We can&#39;t allow the Palestinians to be a couple [miles] from [Tel Aviv&#39;s] Ben Gurion Airport in the age of shoulder-fire missiles with the capacity to shoot down jumbo jets.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18648#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Moreover, Israel is in an anomalous situation: It is an embattled democracy that historically has had to defend itself repeatedly against the armies of neighbouring Arab states whose declared goal was nothing less than Israel&#39;s eradication. The Israel Defense Forces could not afford to miscalculate. While other nations, like France or Kuwait, have been overrun, occupied, and nonetheless have survived to reconstitute themselves, Israel, in contrast, cannot depend on obtaining a second chance. Miscalculation on its part could have had devastating consequences and, thus, its situation is unique.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> For this critical purpose of national survival, therefore, the annexed land serves a legally legitimate purpose, especially considering that the Arab wars of aggression were what caused the annexation of the land in the first place. In such circumstances, a nation that won a defensive war has a right to set terms to ensure against future wars of aggression.</p>

                    <p>The Foreign Minister of Israel, Avigdor Lieberman, said in 2009: &ldquo;A return to the pre-1967 lines, with a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria, would bring the conflict into Israel&#39;s borders. Establishing a Palestinian state will not bring an end to the conflict.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18648#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This is why the American ambassador to the UN at the time of the 1967 war pointed out that &ldquo;Israel&#39;s prior frontiers had proved to be notably insecure&rdquo;, and American President Lyndon Johnson, shortly after the war, declared that Israel&#39;s return to its former lines would be &ldquo;not a prescription for peace but for renewed hostilities.&rdquo; Johnson advocated new &#39;recognized boundaries&#39; that would provide &quot;security against terror, destruction, and war.&rdquo;<a href="/print/18648#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> An Israel that withdrew completely to the 1967 borders would offer a very tempting target, since it would be a narrow country with no strategic depth whose main population centres and strategic infrastructure would be within tactical range of forces deployed along the commanding heights of the West Bank. This would hurt Israel&#39;s ability to deter future attacks and thus make conflict in the region even more likely. This ability of Israel to deter aggressors is particularly important not only due to the region&#39;s history of aggression against Israel, but also due to the unpredictable future events in the highly volatile Middle East. There is no way, for example, to guarantee that Iraq will not evolve into a radical Shi&#39;ite state that is dependent on Iran and hostile to Israel (indeed, King Abdullah of Jordan has warned of a hostile Shi&#39;ite axis that could include Iran, Iraq, and Syria), nor that a Jordan&#39;s Palestinian majority might seize power in the state (leaving Israel to defend itself against a Palestinian state that stretches from Iraq to Kalkilya), nor that&nbsp; in the future, militant Islamic elements will not succeed in gaining control of the Egyptian regime.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>
<p>Given its narrow geographical dimensions, a future attack launched from the pre-1967 borders against Israel&#39;s nine-mile-wide waist could easily split the country in two. Especially seeing as Islamic militants throughout the Middle East are unlikely to be reconciled to Israel even by a withdrawal to the 1967 borders, such a withdrawal therefore would actually make peace in the region less likely and encourage war against Israel.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p>

                    <p>The Middle East, and the world more generally, is a far different place than it was in 1967. There is a significantly smaller risk that Arab states will gang up in a conventional war against Israel. This owes significantly to the fact that Israel is much more powerful militarily, Arab states are less powerful relatively, and the military alliances and dynamics in the region tend to favour Israel more. All of this means that maintaining a buffer in Israel, with the post-1967 borders, for the sake of defending against a collective Arab assault is highly unreasonable. Israel does not need this buffer. It can return to its pre-1967 borders.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Israel has more than just national security at stake in the occupied territory of the West Bank -hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens now live there, many in areas which are not strategically essential (the areas described above). Between the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights (all outside of Israel&#39;s 1967 borders), over 400,000 Israelis live in settlements in the occupied territories.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> These ever-expanding settlements represent a barrier to Israeli withdrawing to its 1967 borders. In 1993, when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat famously shook hands on the White House lawn, there were only 109,000 Israelis living in settlements across the West Bank (not including Jerusalem). Today there are more than 230 settlements and strategically placed &#39;outposts&#39; designed to cement a permanent Jewish presence on Palestinian land.<a href="/print/18648#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Forcibly removing these settlers would be too difficult, could foment a kind of Jewish civil war, and would create a level of resentment among fundamentalist Jews that would likely inflame the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Furthermore it should be remembered that these settlers are Israeli citizens, with families, who moved to these areas because the Israeli government told them it was safe and that they would be allowed to stay, and thus Israel has a moral duty to live up to these promises by not withdrawing. Israel cannot afford this sort of internal turmoil, and should not neglect its duty to protect the rights of these citizens, and so it should not withdraw to its 1967 borders.</p>

                    <p>Israel has forcibly removed settlements when transferring back occupied land in the past, most notably in 1982 in the Sinai and 2005 in Gaza. While difficult, it is possible, and any ensuing difficulties are the fault of the Israeli government for allowing these settlements in the first place, and as such the cost (of not having their own state) should not be borne by the Palestinian people.</p>
