    <h1 class="print-title">This House would intervene to prevent the collapse of the state in other countries.</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Definitions vary, but a failed state is usually thought of as one where any government has broken down to the point where it can no longer provide certain essential services to the people. Most importantly, this often means that law and order has collapsed, with the government losing its monopoly over the legitimate use of force. In such cases, large areas of the country are in the control of non-government forces, perhaps through civil war but often as a result of lawlessness and banditry. Recent estimates by Foreign Policy and the Fund for Peace (see further reading) suggest that up to 2 billion people worldwide live in insecure states where the government has either failed or is fragile, and are exposed to varying degrees of violence as a result.</p>
<p>The most complete example of a failed state is perhaps Somalia, where no government has been able to take effective control of the country since the death of its dictator Siad Barre. Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cote D&#39;Ivoire provide other commonly-discussed examples. States recovering from recent collapse could include Liberia, Sierra Leone and Angola, although in none of these is recovery certain, while Cambodia, Mozambique, Lebanon and East Timor provide examples of relative longer-term success after periods of failure. Today many observers are gloomy about the futures of countries including Zimbabwe, Nepal, Guinea, Afghanistan, Chad, Sudan, Bolivia and Iraq, as well as the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>Proponents of preventative intervention argue it is necessary to prevent the suffering of civilians innocent of the decisions taken on the route to failure, and that allowing failure would risk regional instability. Opponents maintain, in contrast, that the cost of intervention is too high and that to provide a safety net to failing states would only encourage other struggling states to take risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>States should act to help the people of a failing state, as once it collapses no government services will be provided, including law and order. States should work with the UN in leading attempts at conflict resolution, and should engage in subsequent peacekeeping missions and investment in nation-building initiatives (e.g. funding and organising the reintegration of non-combatants into society, organising elections, building up civil society, creating effective government institutions, etc.). The failure of the UN operation in Somalia in 1990 is telling; the country has not had a functioning central government ever since.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Intervention to prevent such outcomes will require both greater willingness to commit funds on the part of the powerful states and a commitment to conflict resolution which has been largely lacking in recent national policy world-wide.</p>

                    <p>States should act to protect their own civilians first and foremost, not those in failing states. As such, soldiers should not be sacrificed for the lives of civilians elsewhere; that is not what soldiers enlist for nor does it fit a state&rsquo;s role as a guarantor of security for its own citizens. Civilians in failing states are the ones that ultimately need to take the responsibility for usurping the incumbent powers in their state. Furthermore, even if it were the case that states should act to prevent failing states, there are means to do this that do not include intervention; charities can provide humanitarian assistance, states can offer mediation services if there is a dispute and diaspora communities can provide finance.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>It is in the interests of international stability that failing states are rescued before it is too late. Failed states often infect a whole region, as the collapse of Liberia did in West Africa - a problem known as contagion. Neighbouring states back different factions with arms and squabble over resources, such as the diamonds of Sierra Leone and the mineral wealth of Congo. Internally neighbours are destabilised by floods of refugees and weapons from next door. Their own rebel groups can also easily find shelter to regroup and mount fresh attacks in the lawless country just over their borders. Former U.N. Secretary Boutros-Ghali claimed, as his justification for support for failing states, that the U.N. has a responsibility under its Charter to &lsquo;maintain international peace and security&rsquo; amid fears &lsquo;the demise of a state is often marked by violence and widespread human rights violations that affect other states&rsquo;.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Intervention prevents this by entailing the establishment of conditions for reconstruction which thereafter provides physical infrastructure, facilities and social services. The ultimate goal therefore of the intervention is to ensure that both the state concerned and the region as a whole require no further military or monetary support.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>Failing states do not infect a whole region. The contagion theory is hard to apply beyond a small group of countries in West Africa - elsewhere failed states do not tend to drag down their neighbours with them. For example, countries bordering Somalia, such as Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Eritrea, are far from perfect but none of them are close to being considered a failed state. In fact, whilst Somalia is seen as the basket case in the region after the failed U.N. intervention in 1992, the percentage of its population that lives on less than $1 a day is in fact less than those of its West African neighbours.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Therefore, in most cases the best solution to the problem of failed states is not intervention but for regional groups (e.g. ECOMOG in West Africa, the African Union in Western Sudan, the European Union in Macedonia, Australia in East Timor) to take responsibility for their areas rather than to overburden the USA and UN. In sum, &lsquo;not all failing states pose true dangers to the peace&rsquo; and therefore the U.N.&rsquo;s responsibility for &lsquo;international peace and security&rsquo; is not a sufficient basis for action to resurrect <em>all</em> failing or failed states&rsquo;.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

                    <p>Failed states also export dangers more widely, as they often provide an opportunity for drug crops such as Opium (Afghanistan) or Coca (parts of Colombia) to be grown, processed and traded without fear of authority, with devastating effects both locally and globally. Desperate people may also take refuge in religious or political extremism, which may in time come to threaten the rest of the world. In so doing, failed states often become havens for terrorists, who can find safety in them to plot against the West, to establish training camps for future terrorists, and to build up finance, weapons and other resources with which to mount campaigns. In what was a key claim that later underpinned the 2002 US National Security Strategy and the U.S. War on Terror, Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, has described failed states as &lsquo;breeding grounds of instability, mass migration, and murder&rsquo;.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This can be seen in Somalia, where states in recent years have &lsquo;begun to fear al Qaeda will take advantage of the lawlessness&rsquo;.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Other fragile states, such as Niger, Congo and Sierra Leone have radioactive and other valuable minerals which could be very dangerous in the hands of determined terrorists. The USA should work with the UN to strengthen governments so that they can more effectively maintain internal order while controlling their borders and tracking resource-flows.</p>

                    <p>There is very limited evidence to support the theory that failed states become havens for terrorists. It is true that there are some Al-Qaeda sympathisers in Somalia, but these seem to be few in number and no greater in threat to the USA and its allies than similar groups in other countries. Nor is Afghanistan a good example of this theory; Osama Bin Laden was invited to take refuge there by an established government - the Taliban - only after they had successfully grabbed power in Afghanistan. Before this, Bin Laden was sheltered in Sudan - not in the war-torn and lawless south, but in the northern part where the government was in firm control.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Here the problem was not a failed state, but rather one with an extreme Islamist government. On the other hand, Iran and Syria are both accused of providing bases for terrorists, but neither could be considered a failed state.</p>

                    <p>The United Nations, and its resident body, the Security Council, has both the right and the capability to intervene in countries in order to maintain the peace. Peace in this sense represents more than the absence of bloodshed, but also provides the means by which aid organizations can enter a territory and provide the requisite resources to prevent civilian suffering. The United Nations have proven their efficacy in this area, mandating an intervention in the Ivory Coast in 2003 that sought to prevent the exacerbation of tensions between the government and rebel forces.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> A ceasefire was eventually brokered in 2007 and the failure of the state averted.

                    <p>The United Nations has demonstrated that it lacks both the organizational ethos and the forces required to effectively prevent the failure of states. The veto power on the Security Council ensures that troops for intervention are only mandated when they suit the interests of the most powerful states. Furthermore, the nature of the UN&rsquo;s forces, almost always composite forces made up of a number of different states, renders them ineffective once on the ground. The example of Sierra Leone is telling, a ceasefire was only agreed upon three years after the UN entered the state, and as late as 2009, the UN&rsquo;s own head in the region noted the country is still in a precarious situation, &lsquo;with ethnic and interreligious conflicts and increasing threats from international crime&rsquo;.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Failure was not prevented, merely put off.</p>

                    <p>Interventions are not a panacea for failing states; they do not ensure the success of either the military offensive or subsequent reconstruction efforts on the ground during the occupation. If the intervention fails to overcome local forces, civilians are powerless to overcome a political hierarchy boosted by military victory and reliant on violence. Furthermore, even if the military offensive is successful, the underlying causes of the failure of the state are still present and may be exacerbated by the presence of an intervening force. As such, intervening forces must be aware that the decision is not simply whether intervention is necessary, but whether it will do more harm than good. Coyne describes this fallacy as the &lsquo;Nirvana Fallacy&rsquo;, whereby states assume that the &lsquo;grass is always greener on the other side&rsquo;. &lsquo;It is assumed that the foreign governments can generate, via occupation and reconstruction, an outcome preferable to that which would occur absent of these interventions&rsquo;. The reality challenges these assumptions, for Minxim Pei calculates just a 26% success rate for U.S.-led reconstruction efforts since the late nineteenth century.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> If an intervening force can&rsquo;t be certain, even remotely, of the benefit to the state concerned, it has little justification in deploying and risking the exacerbation of an already-precarious problem.</p>

                    <p>Interventions can, and do, fail, however so long as their intentions are good, they must still be attempted if the effects of failed states are to be prevented. Furthermore, the humanitarian catastrophes linked to failing and failed states: &lsquo;mass migration, environmental degradation, regional instability; energy insecurity and transnational terrorism&rsquo; are not the fault of a failed intervention, but a failed state.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The U.S.-led intervention in Somalia in 1992 is a case in point; though the intervention failed and, it could be argued, exacerbated conditions in Somalia, it did not lead to the state&rsquo;s failure, it merely failed to prevent it. As such, the U.S. cannot be blamed for attempting to stand with Somalis and save their state; that they failed is unfortunate, but the subsequent continuing humanitarian catastrophe is not the fault of intervening forces.&nbsp; So long as there is hope that interventions can prevent failed states, the success rate is above 0%, they should be attempted for the alternative is little better for the civilians concerned.</p>

The &lsquo;safety net&rsquo; purports to protect civilians by preventing the failure of states; it does not guarantee the protection of those governments responsible for the near-failure.

                    <p>The cost of intervention is too high. The United Nations has neither the money nor the support of the international community to undertake speculative missions. Already it fails to meet its targets for troops to provide peacekeeping in countries which request its help. The USA already contributes nearly a quarter of the UN&#39;s peacekeeping budget and cannot afford more at a time when it is already stretched by major commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is difficult to see where else the necessary funds could come from. The reconstruction of Afghanistan is expected to cost as much as $15 billion over the next ten years, &lsquo;plus the cost of training a new army and police force&rsquo;.<a href="/print/18215#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> At a time of financial austerity, American citizens are entitled to ask whether their money is being spent prudently.

                    <p>The cost of intervention is lower than the cost of inactivity. Sometimes, as in Afghanistan and the former Yugoslavia, the situation will become so bad that US military intervention is necessary - this is hugely costly compared to funding preventative action through the United Nations. The role of failed states as reservoirs from which refugees, narcotics, terrorism, illegal diamonds, etc. are exported means that the USA already spends many billions of dollars a year in dealing with the mess they create. Finally, there is an opportunity cost of lost trade and investment which applies to the developing world and developed economies alike (e.g. the benefits to the US of trade with oil-rich Angola, Sudan and Congo).&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The current US approach to international development, in which aid, loans or market access are conditional upon good governance, should be maintained and even extended more widely. Such conditions provide incentives for developing countries to put constructive policies in place and reward those who fight corruption. As past failures show all too clearly, there is no point throwing money at chaotic, lawless and corrupt regimes - it will never reach the people anyway. In any case, humanitarian relief is not conditional and the USA continues to respond with compassion to emergencies anywhere in the world. It should also be noted that special measures to support states identified as at risk of failure could in themselves be harmful. Discussion of intervention will scare off investors and help to bring about economic collapse - becoming self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>

Sensible though this seems, it denies international help to those states whose people need it most - those where government is weak or absent.

The United Nations has expertise and is widely respected, which will be required considering the international reputation of the USA is now sufficiently damaged that the hostility it generates can undermine the good work it wishes to do. In partnership the USA can provide resources to enable the UN to secure the future stability of many fragile countries, while the UN&#39;s involvement can show that these operations are altruistic and pose no imperialist threat. Over time, commitment through the UN to international peace and humanitarian concerns will allow the USA to change the way it is viewed worldwide - an important aspect of the War on Terror.
