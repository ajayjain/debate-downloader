    <h1 class="print-title">This House Would Remove the Israeli Security Wall</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>At the height of the second <em>intifadah, </em>between 2000 and 2006, Palestinian suicide bombers moved with relative ease from the West Bank into Israeli cities. The then Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon responded to public pressure for action by ordering the construction of a physical security barrier in and around the West Bank.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In June 2002, the Israeli government began erecting a 620 kilometres long barrier in the Occupied Territories of the West Bank in order to protect Israelis from suicide attacks. Very broadly, the barrier creates a physical divide along the pre-1967 “Green Line” between Israel and what is now the Palestinian Authority. However, although the northern part of the barrier follows the “Green Line” pretty closely, much of the rest of its route involves great loops eastward into Palestinian territory in order to protect Israeli settlements there. Most of the barrier is fence, within a 60-100 metre zone of military tracks and ditches, but some of the most notorious parts are made up of 8 metre high concrete walls.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The barrier has become extremely controversial and many countries and non-governmental organisations have spoken against it. Even the naming of the barrier/wall has become very controversial; proponents of it usually name it a security barrier or security fence, while the opponents tend to call it a wall.&nbsp;Supporters argue for the barrier mainly for security reasons, while detractors argue for dismantling Israel’s security wall on the grounds that it violates international law and equates to a breach of human rights. After years of negotiations, there have been route changes often due to Palestinian protest,<a href="/print/17795#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> and stoppages in construction of the barrier. As of July 2010 only 64% of the barrier had been completed with no date for when it would be completed.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Rothem, Dan. “How Israel's Security Barrier Affects a Final Border.” <em>The Atlantic. </em>04/11/2011.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/11/how-israels-security-barrier-affects-a-final-border/247931/">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/11/how-israels-security-barrier-affects-a-final-border/247931/</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> “International Legality of the Security Fence and Sections near Alfei Menashe.” <em>Zionism. </em>15/09/2005.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zionism-israel.com/hdoc/High_Court_Fence.htm">http://www.zionism-israel.com/hdoc/High_Court_Fence.htm</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Sanders, Edmund, ‘Israel begins rerouting West Bank barrier’, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, 12 February 2010, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/12/world/la-fg-israel-barrier12-2010feb12" title="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/12/world/la-fg-israel-barrier12-2010feb12">http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/12/world/la-fg-israel-barrier12-201...</a></p></div><div id="ftn4"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> Lazaroff, Tovah, ‘Security barrier remains unfinished’, <em>JPost.com</em>, 8<sup>th</sup> July 2010, <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=180775">http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=180775</a> [if anyone can provide a more up to date status please do!]</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="field field-type-text field-field-debate-authors">

                    <p>Israel’s security wall is a breach of international law. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague was asked by the United Nations General Assembly to consider the legality of the barrier and, in July 2004, it ruled that the security wall was a breach of international laws.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Specifically, it found that the Fourth Geneva Convention and international human rights conventions did apply in the Occupied Territories. The security wall breached the Geneva Convention because it assisted illegal settlements and its building injured private property owners.</p><p>Human rights conventions are breached by the wall because it restricts freedom of movement and the right to an adequate standard of living, health and education. The wall cuts through people’s lands therefore depriving them of their property which can in turn mean their livelihood is significantly affected due to not being able to grow as much as before. As with the checkpoints around the west bank the wall prevents freedom of movement which can split people’s place of residence from their place of work or other facilities necessary for life such as schools and hospitals. As the court recognised therefore the barrier therefore substantially impacts on the living standards of the Palestinians. Finally, the Court ruled that the barrier’s route could allow Israel to annex territory, harming the Palestinians right to self-determination.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Thein, Ben. “Is Israel’s Security Barrier Unique?” <em>Middle East Forum.</em> Fall 2004. <a href="http://www.meforum.org/652/is-israels-security-barrier-unique">http://www.meforum.org/652/is-israels-security-barrier-unique</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The opinion of the ICJ is advisory and, therefore, largely symbolic. In this case the Court was asked by the General Assembly to comment on a resolution which was already anti-Israel, so the form of the request prejudged the decision. It is shameful that the ICJ has allowed itself to be captured politically in this way. Moreover, Israel does not acknowledge the automatic jurisdiction of the ICJ and is therefore not bound to implement its rulings. The Occupied Territories were never part of a recognised state, and so the various international conventions do not apply there.</p><p>The Oslo Accord between Israel and the Palestinians says that disputes must be settled by negotiation, not by unilateral appeal to external bodies, and so the PLO has broken its own commitments in going to the ICJ. For these reasons, Israel boycotted the ICJ hearings along with the United States and the European Union, both major players in the peace process; they too believe that the case could undermine the political peace talks.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Israel has been willing to respond to worries about human rights worries such as loosing livelihoods with negotiations which has resulted in some sections of the barrier being moved.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Blenford, Adam. “Israel ‘poised to boycott barrier hearings’.” <em>The Guardian. </em>12/02/2004. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/12/israel1">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/12/israel1</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Sanders, ‘Israel begins rerouting West Bank barrier’, 2010</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Any short term security gain will be offset by growing Palestinian resentment against Israel, which could result in a greater number of suicide attacks in Israel. Israelis and Palestinians will need to learn to live side by side; building an eight metre high wall sends a clear message to Palestinians that Israel is hostile and unwilling to find a permanent solution that would suit both nations. When constructing the barrier through Jerusalem for example the wall splits communities, disrupts everyday life and declares that a shared sovereignty solution is no longer possible for the city both sides claim as their capital. When people’s lives are disrupted by something that they feel is unnecessary and discriminatory it is bound to increase resentment. In this case it is made worse by the barrier being sited on land the Palestinians consider theirs. It should therefore be no surprise if more Palestinians turn to the only way they see that they get any response from Israel - violence. It would be hard to find a better way to radicalise the inhabitants of East Jerusalem.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Israel has a legitimate right to self-defence and the protection of its people. The barrier is intended to prevent Palestinian suicide bombers from crossing into Israel. Before the barrier was in place, 900 Israelis died in such attacks.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> If there were no terror threat, there would be no need for a barrier. Since the construction of the security wall, it has been much more difficult for Palestinian terrorist groups to mount suicide attacks in Israel. For more than three years, no Palestinian terrorists have been able to get through the barrier to attack civilians.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> A security measure which has saved the lives of countless innocent people demands our support and should be completed as soon as possible. East Jerusalem during the second intifada was relatively quiet precisely because it was cut off from the rest of the West Bank and the movement of the residents was restricted.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Young, Darrell G. “The Land of Unwalled Villages.” <em>Focus on Jerusalem. </em>February 2004. <a href="http://focusonjerusalem.com/thelandofunwalledvillages.html">http://focusonjerusalem.com/thelandofunwalledvillages.html</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> “Israel’s Security Fence.” <em>Jewish Virtual Library. </em>08/07/2010. <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/talking/24_fence.html">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/talking/24_fence.html</a></p></div><div id="ftn3"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Jerusalem Quarterly, ‘The Marginalization of Jerusalem in the al-Aqsa Intifada’, <em>Institute of Jerusalem Studies</em>, Issue 14, Autumn 2001, <a href="http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/ViewArticle.aspx?id=178" title="http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/ViewArticle.aspx?id=178">http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/ViewArticle.aspx?id=178</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The Security wall could weaken the Palestinian position at any peace negotiations, as it affects the facts on the ground which in turn impact negotiations. Creating the barrier essentially unilaterally annexes land to Israel from the West Bank as that land is no longer accessible from the West Bank but is accessible with no restrictions from Israel. Many of these areas that are being&nbsp; ‘annexed’ are being annexed precisely because they include the Israeli settlements that have been built up in the West Bank so this land is being occupied by Israeli citizens who are having infrastructure built for them. The more this happens the more difficult it will be for Israel to give the land back later. Israel will rightly be able to claim that if only Israelis live within the barrier why should they give that land back as a majority of the population would be against it?</p><p>The Israeli government may say that the wall is only a temporary measure, but in the Occupied Territories earlier “temporary measures”, such as Israeli settlements and military seizure of Palestinian land, have usually proved to be permanent.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It is doubtful that Israel would spend $1 billion on a “temporary measure”.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Trager, Eric. “Security Fences Make Good Neighbours.” <em>Harvard Israel Review. </em>2003. <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hireview/content.php?type=article&amp;issue=spring04/&amp;name=trager">http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hireview/content.php?type=article&amp;issue=spring04/&amp;name=trager</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The security barrier is only temporary and, therefore, will not affect any peace negotiations. Israel has made clear that it expects any border settlement to be negotiated with the Palestinians. The barrier will be moved or dismantled should there be a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Such an agreement will never take place, however, without proper security for Israelis. In this way, Israel’s security barrier will actually bring a full peace settlement closer.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Israel’s security wall effectively annexes Palestinian territory. Palestinian leaders assert that the route chosen could lead to almost half of the cultivatable land in the West Bank being annexed.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This obviously reduces the viability of any eventual Palestinian state as it will need to rely more on imported food.

It also violates property rights, as thousands of acres of land have been taken away from Palestinian owners in order to build the wall and the wide strip of access tracks beside it. This is clearly wrong and a barrier that kept to the 1967 border would have allowed the Palestinians a viable future state while also providing security for Israel.</p><div><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Mair, Lucy. “Backs to the Wall”. <em>Dollars and Sense. </em>November 2003. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Israel/Backs_To_Wall.html">http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Israel/Backs_To_Wall.html</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17795#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title=""><strong>[2]</strong></a> Kahmal, Ahmed. “UK censures Sharon over fence around West Bank.” <em>The Guardian. </em>27/04/2003. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/apr/27/israel?INTCMP=SRCH">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/apr/27/israel?INTCMP=SRCH</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The security barrier reduces political tensions and encourages self-determination; Israelis and Palestinians will encounter each other less and will learn to live on their own territories. After the wall is completed, 80% of Jewish settlers in the West Bank will be sheltered behind the barrier.<a href="/print/17795#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In time, entry systems will become more routine and Palestinians will be treated better.

Long queues at checkpoints have had a significant impact on the lives of Palestinians and have damaged the economy. Clashes with the military have been a constant problem in the Palestinian territories.

Moreover, hard to obtain special passes are needed to enter the Israeli side of the wall.
