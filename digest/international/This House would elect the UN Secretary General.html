    <h1 class="print-title">This House would elect the UN Secretary General</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>Currently, the Secretary-General of the United Nations is appointed by the General Assembly upon nomination by the Security Council (SC). This means the appointment is therefore subject to the veto of its five permanent (P5) members: Russia, China, The United States, The United Kingdom and France. An accepted practice of regional rotation has also been adopted in the selection of candidates. These procedures occur largely behind closed doors and, critics claim, fall far short of other international high-level public sector appointment procedures established to ensure qualified appointments. The same critics claim that reforms need to be implemented to the selection process in order to raise the level of transparency, accountability and democracy within the institution. One such radical reform could be the election of the Secretary-General through popular vote - i.e. the vote of individual citizens of its 192 member states.</p><p><strong>Possible practical proposal:</strong></p><p>It would be difficult for a government to argue for a mechanism of popular vote in the 192 member states (the EU parliament is difficult enough to elect with only 27 member states – but it can be used as a basic model). However, it is much easier to maintain that the Secretary General should be elected by popular vote of the delegates in the UN General Assembly (i.e. by people who have entrusted with the power to represent the interests of their citizens).</p><p>A Canadian paper from 2006</p><p>“suggested:</p><p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">1.&nbsp; The selection should be "anchored in agreed criteria/qualifications".</p><p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">2.&nbsp; A "search committee should be asked to identify potential candidates".</p><p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">3.&nbsp; There should be opportunities for candidates to meet with all Members of the General Assembly—perhaps through regional group meetings.</p><p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">4.&nbsp; The Presidents of the General Assembly and the Security Council should organize some informal events, under their joint auspices to permit an "exploration of the perspectives and positions of the candidates".”<a href="/print/17780#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></p><p>India called for the UNSC to propose 3 candidates to the General Assembly, instead of one.<a href="/print/17780#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a></p><p><strong>Possible alternative</strong><strong>&nbsp;motions:</strong></p><p>Should the Secretary-General of the United Nations be elected through the direct vote of the citizens of member states?</p><p>This house would reform UN Secretary-General elections</p><p>This house believes the Security Council should not play a role in the election of the Secretary-General </p><p>This house would directly elect the UN Secretary-General </p><p>This house would elect the UN Secretary-General by popular vote </p><p>This house believes that the election of the Secretary-General should not be subject to the veto of the permanent five</p><div><br clear="all"><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="edn1"><p><a href="http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/site/c.glKWLeMTIsG/b.1807393/k.1D24/Special_Research_ReportBRSecond_Report_on_the_Appointment_of_the_UN_SecretaryGeneralBR21_June_2006.htm#devel">http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/site/c.glKWLeMTIsG/b.1807393/k.1D24/Special_Research_ReportBRSecond_Report_on_the_Appointment_of_the_UN_SecretaryGeneralBR21_June_2006.htm#devel</a> Accessed on 22.08.2011</p></div><div id="edn2"><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="content-multigroup-wrapper content-multigroup-0"><div class="field field-type-text field-field-point-title">

                    <p>Most Secretaries-General are compromise-candidates from middle powers and with little prior fame. High-profile candidates, like Bill Clinton, are often touted for the job, but are almost always rejected as unpalatable to some of the permanent member states. For instance, figures like Charles De Gaulle or Dwight Eisenhower are rumored to have been considered for the first Secretary-General position<a href="/print/17780#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>, but were rejected in favor of the uncontroversial Norwegian, Trygve Lie. Thus excellent leaders and statesmen are outright excluded from the selection process because the permanent five have no incentive to nominate a strong, forceful figure for the role. Popular election would reverse this bias, as only well-known international heavy-weight figures would be able to gain sufficient votes from citizens all over the world. Californian governor Jerry Brown signed a bill deciding to award all California electoral votes to the candidate for US president that wins the national popular vote<a href="/print/17780#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. The following analogy can be made: popular vote reflects the opinions of all over whom the person elected will have power, and should not be surpassed by bureaucracy such as veto power or the electoral college system.</p><div><br clear="all"><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17780#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Wikipedia, ‘Secretary-General of the United Nations’, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations</a></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17780#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Williams “California Popular Vote Bill” <em>Huffington Post </em>08.08.2011 Accessed on 02.09. 2011 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/08/california-popular-vote-bill-jerry-brown_n_921676.html" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/08/california-popular-vote-bill-jerry-brown_n_921676.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/08/california-popular-vote-bill-je...</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Simply because Secretaries-General are elected through a compromise process does not mean that they will not perform well on the job or that they will be lackeys of the permanent members. For example, Kofi Annan became a powerful and charismatic leader during his time in office. In spite of the US having supported his nomination, he was often critical of its foreign policy and human rights record in the war against terror. Another Secretary- General, Dag Hammarskjöld, developed the UN Emergency Force, deployed during the 1956 Suez Crisis in which two of the permanent five members were implicated. The deployment of troops was done with no authorization from the Security Council and has since significantly shaped the protocol on UN peacekeeping missions.<a href="/print/17780#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p>Also, while well-known former statesmen might have the necessary qualities to lead their countries, when vested with considerable powers, they might not thrive in an environment where negotiation, compromise and the maintenance of a delicate balance between the interests of various states are vital.</p><div><br clear="all"><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17780#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> United Nations Department of Public Information, ‘First United Nations Emergency Force UNEF I (November 1956 – June 1967)’, un.org, 2003, &nbsp;http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unefi.htm</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Gender and geographic diversity would improve among candidates. Out of eight Secretaries-General so far, a woman has yet to lead the organization. Furthermore, women candidates are rarely even considered. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, only got seven positive votes when she ran against Ban Ki-moon.<a href="/print/17780#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Getting rid of the cumbersome veto process might encourage more women to come forward. Currently, the status quo tends to perpetuate itself. The representatives who end up making the decisions on a candidates viability are usually men, from wealthy and privileged backgrounds. By bringing more people into the decision-making process, the door is open to more types of people. For example, Hilary Clinton or German Chancellor Merkel might be candidates, as well as figures from Eastern Europe (who have held no SG positions so far).</p><div><br clear="all"><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17780#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Hoge, Warren,&nbsp; ‘South Korean Favored to Win Top Job at U.N.’, 29 September 2006,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/29/world/29nations.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/29/world/29nations.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/29/world/29nations.html</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>Geographic diversity is already ensured by the system of regional rotation in the selection of candidates. As for gender diversity, women find it hard to get elected even in countries which have strong traditions in protecting and promoting women’s rights. Those liberal countries represent a small minority of UN member states and of world population. Confronted with a ‘world electorate’, a woman’s chances of getting elected would be slim to none.</p>        </div>

This will not only impede the selection process, but might result in an unsuitable candidate being the final choice.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>A popular election would politicise the role of the Secretary-General. The role requires complete neutrality and equidistance between the competing positions of member states.

                    <p>The UN is a cooperative, largely non-hierarchical body whose budget and military force come directly from its member states. In order to achieve results, the willing cooperation of states is paramount. The power of the Secretary-General to implement change comes from his special relationship with the Security Council. The SC is the only body within the UN which can actually adopt binding resolutions, and these are also subject to the veto of any of the permanent members of the SC. If the Secretary-General has an antagonistic relationship with the SC it could result in complete stalemate over any proposal he might bring to the Council’s attention. Even in matters not directly related to security and therefore not susceptible to a veto, like the Millennium Goals, the backing of these five nations will vastly improve any initiative’s chance of success. It is therefore very important that the SG is someone who all permanent members feel comfortable working with, not someone whom they perceive as an untrustworthy antagonist. The veto process strengthens that bond. The official website of the UN lists the role of the SG as: “The Charter also empowers the Secretary-General to "bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security”<a href="/print/17780#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> which means that he has to be accepted by the entire UNSC in order to achieve effective cooperation.</p><div><br clear="all"><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p><a href="/print/17780#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> United Nations, ‘Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/sgrole.shtml" title="http://www.un.org/sg/sgrole.shtml">http://www.un.org/sg/sgrole.shtml</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The role of the Secretary-General has greatly evolved from the one mapped out in the Charter. He has come to act not just as chief administrator, but also as an advocate, as a mediator, and a spokesperson, upholding and promoting the principles of the United Nations. Often, these principles and the organization’s objectives are contrary to the interests of some or all of the permanent members of the Security Council - e.g. energetically advancing a human rights agenda, pressuring rich nations into pledging more money toward aid, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, or promoting nuclear disarmament. The voting process ensures that only candidates who are broadly sympathetic to the interests of the permanent five get the nomination. Therefore no progressive candidate is ever selected. A proper global election would allow the best candidate to win office, even if members of the P5 disagree with them. And, as the example of the US shows (with Congress and the President), two separate centers of power can work together.</p>        </div>
