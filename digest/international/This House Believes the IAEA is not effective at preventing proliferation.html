    <h1 class="print-title">This House Believes the IAEA is not effective at preventing proliferation</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>At the end of the Cold War, believing that the nuclear threat had finally receded, much of the world breathed a collective sigh of relief. Victory in the Cold War, however, sowed the seeds of a new threat: that of nuclear proliferation (the spread of nuclear weapons). In recent years this topic has never been far from the headlines. In 2003, Iraq's nuclear program was given as one justification for the second Gulf War. In the 2004 US Presidential election campaign, both President Bush and Senator Kerry identified nuclear proliferation as the single biggest security threat facing the United States. In 2005 the international body set up to prevent proliferation, the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) and its Director, Mohamed ElBaradei, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work. </p><p>The cornerstone of the international law concerning nuclear weapons is the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Every state in the world except India, Israel, Pakistan and North Korea are signatories. North Korea was a member but withdrew in 2003. Under the NPT, five states (China, France, Russia, the UK and the US) are recognized as having the right to possess nuclear weapons. These states are known as the Nuclear Weapon States (NWS). The other states, the non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS), have promised not to acquire nuclear weapons. In return, they have 'the inalienable right' to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. One cause of proliferation is that civilian nuclear programs can be used to make the fuel for a nuclear bomb (the hardest part of any nuclear weapons program). Specifically, there are two routes for making reactor fuel: uranium enrichment (in which uranium ore is refined) and plutonium reprocessing (in which plutonium is separated from used reactor fuel). However, exactly the same processes can be used to refine the product still further and make weapons-grade material. The IAEA was set up to monitor civilian nuclear programs and ensure that they are used for legitimate purposes. The IAEA inspects nuclear facilities and, if it believes that a state is using them to build a nuclear weapon, then it must report this to the United Nations Security Council. The usual objection to IAEA effectiveness is its inability to access states that haven’t signed the NPT. The US has recently become frustrated with IAEA efforts and has started to work outside the framework of the NTP. In particular, President Bush had proposed that enrichment and reprocessing facilities should be denied to states that do already possess them. He has also started the Proliferation Security Initiative, an informal arrangement between the US and its allies to share intelligence and intercept suspect cargoes at sea. Note that the US essentially views these actions as a supplement, rather than an alternative, to the NPT and IAEA. Nobody would deny that the IAEA has had some successes, and few in the US are keen to abandon the NPT entirely; rather this debate is about whether it is effective for the US to take additional action to prevent nuclear proliferation. A very current issue is the question of Iran and the chances of it acquiring nuclear weapons, where IAEA sanctions and warnings have been ignored by Iran or considered ineffective by some countries, like the USA.</p><div class="field field-type-nodereference field-field-debatabase-authors">

                    <p>States can legally acquire the capacity to build a nuclear bomb and then withdraw from the treaty. The essential problem is that uranium and plutonium are used as fuel for both nuclear reactors and nuclear bombs. The processes by which these materials are manufactured (uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing) are permitted because they have legitimate applications in civilian nuclear programs. On its website it is stated: “the IAEA verifies through its inspection system that States comply with their commitments, under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and other non-proliferation agreements, to use nuclear material and facilities only for peaceful purposes.” <a href="/print/17781#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Providing a state 'plays along' with the IAEA and allows inspections, it can legally acquire these technologies. Then, once it is in a position to produce material suitable for use in a weapon, it can simply leave the NPT. All a state then has to do to leave the NPT is give 6 months’ notice; the IAEA is then left powerless. Indeed, this is precisely what North Korea did, and what it is feared that Iran will do. North Korea is known to have reprocessing technology (and it probably has an enrichment capability too). In 2003 it withdrew from the NPT (following the breakdown of an agreement with the US) placing its facilities out of the reach of the IAEA. Although international law has succeeded in preventing proliferation in some cases, its 'optional' nature means that to be truly effective it must sometimes be bolstered by American unilateral action.</p><div><a href="/print/17781#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> IAEA, ‘The IAEA Mission Statement’, iaea.org, http://www.iaea.org/About/mission.html</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is not a loophole to allow states to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Many states have energy supply problems and nuclear is often a necessary part of the energy mix. It may be true that the IAEA does not move as quickly as the USA would like but there are advantages to its careful, meticulous approach. First, this approach ensures that the IAEA does not make false accusations. As the United States found out recently in Iraq, assessing the state of a WMD program is a tricky exercise and mistakes can be costly. Second, the IAEA's approach allows for a gradual build-up of international pressure. It is unrealistic to expect immediate agreement from the entire international community about the need to deal with a potential proliferator. By carefully acquiring and presenting evidence the IAEA can gradually build up international support. This process also leads to an increase of pressure on the potential proliferator and hence the chance of a peaceful solution.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The IAEA's approach to non-proliferation (monitoring nuclear facilities) focuses, almost entirely, on what is known as the demand side. America can supplement this with a counter-proliferation strategy that focuses on preventing supply. A US-led coalition has, for example, started the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)<a href="/print/17781#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. States within the PSI have agreed to share intelligence about unlawful shipments of nuclear materials and then intercept these cargoes at sea. This strategy enables the US to prevent proliferation to organizations which are outside of the IAEA's reach, namely terrorist organizations and states which are not party to, or ignore, the NPT. Although exact details are kept secret, a number of illegal shipments have been stopped and seized under PSI. A second example of America's supply-side approach is the proposal to stop the spread of reprocessing and enrichment.<a href="/print/17781#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Clearly, preventing potential proliferators from buying the technology to produce nuclear weapons in the first place is a more effective strategy than monitoring it once it is in the hands of states which may abuse it.</p><div><a href="/print/17781#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> U.S. Department of State, ‘Proliferation Security Initiative’, <a href="http://www.state.gov/t/isn/c10390.htm" title="http://www.state.gov/t/isn/c10390.htm">http://www.state.gov/t/isn/c10390.htm</a><br><div id="ftn2"><p><a href="/print/17781#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Lucas, Sean, ‘The Bush Proposals: A Global Strategy for Combating the Spread of Nuclear Weapons Technology or a Sanctioned Nuclear Cartel?’ <em>James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies</em>, November 2004, <a href="http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_58a.html" title="http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_58a.html">http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_58a.html</a></p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The US strategy of preventing proliferation on the supply side is flawed for two reasons: it doesn't work and simultaneously undermines more effective demand-side efforts. America's attempts to halt the spread of reprocessing and enrichment are doomed to failure because it cannot convince other nations to do the same. In 2004 President Bush approached the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and asked its member states not to export reprocessing and enrichment facilities to states which do already possess them. The NSG refused, effectively ruining the President's plan - without the support of every nation that already these technologies he cannot hope to prevent their further spread. However, even if he had got the agreement of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, there would still be the problem of preventing states from developing this technology themselves without help.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Unlike the IAEA, the USA is able to take fast, decisive action against a potential proliferator. In contrast, the United States can act quickly and decisively. Quickly because there is usually consensus between the President and Congress about proliferation issues. Decisively because of the massive diplomatic, economic and, in extreme cases, military power at the USA's disposal. This power can not only be used to stop a potential proliferator in its tracks but is also an effective deterrent to states trying to go nuclear. In an example, the US was able to take decisive action in Kosovo when the rest of the world was dealing with bureaucracy, instead of helping the people there.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Apart from the lack of checks and balances associated with US unilateral action, the threat of such action is unlikely to prevent proliferation. Rather it will encourage other states to try and acquire nuclear weapons as a counterweight to the US. Those states that are currently in the process of acquiring nuclear weapons (Iran and North Korea) are doing so precisely because they are the only effective means of deterring US conventional power. Were the USA to stop acting outside of the IAEA, international efforts to curb Iranian and North Korean weapons programs would likely be much more effective.</p>        </div>

                    <p>It was predicted in the 1960s (when there were five nuclear weapon states) that by the end of the 1970s there could be 25 to 30 nuclear powers.<a href="/print/17781#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The situation today is so much better than almost anyone predicted back then. There are eight certain nuclear powers (India, Israel and Pakistan being the new nuclear nations, and none of the three has ever signed the NPT) and maybe a ninth: it is far from clear that North Korea actually has working nuclear weapons. The NPT works because no state wants their neighbors to acquire nuclear weapons. When the IAEA inspects a nuclear reactor in one state, it can confirm that the facility is not being used for military purposes. Other states are therefore reassured and have less of an incentive to try and develop a bomb. Of course, the so-called loophole that the proposition identify is a problem. However, a state leaving the NPT does not prevent action: either through negotiations (such as the on-going 'six party' talks with North Korea), economic sanctions or even military action, if authorised by the Security Council. The 'loophole' is the price that must be paid for a treaty to which the vast majority of states will commit and respect. The alternative is a world in which there is no NPT and a much larger number of nuclear nations.</p><div><a href="/print/17781#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Hoppe, Hannelore, ‘Towards A Successful 2005 NPT Review Conference’, in <em>Building a Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone in the Middle East</em>, (United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, 2004), p.11, http://www.unidir.org/pdf/ouvrages/pdf-1-92-9045-168-8-en.pdf</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>The IAEA is slow, bureaucratic and unable to enforce its decisions. Speed of detection and action are crucial in preventing proliferation. However, if a state refuses access to IAEA inspectors then all that results is a drawn-out diplomatic battle. Even if the IAEA's Board of Directors does eventually report non-compliance to the UN, there is still no guarantee that the Security Council will actually act. Indeed, given the controversy surrounding such decisions and the existence of the veto, the chance of UN action is pretty small. All of this bother gives the would-be proliferator time to go nuclear. Iran is a case in point. The Director-General of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, first announced his concerns about Iran in the fall of 2003. Not only did it take until October 2005 for the IAEA to pass a non-compliance resolution with a vote that was far from unanimous<a href="/print/17781#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> (22 for, 1 against and 12 abstentions including Russia and China) but that resolution didn't even refer the matter to the UN; it merely gave Iran yet another chance to comply with the IAEA's demands.</p><div><a href="/print/17781#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Board of Governors, ‘Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran’, <em>IAEA</em>, 24 September 2005,&nbsp; http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2005/gov2005-77.pdf</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>When preventing proliferation the current frameworks are the best strategy. This framework is damaged if the United States chooses to work outside of it. Part of the reason is symbolic: if the USA works outside the IAEA it sends out a powerful message that the IAEA and NPT are irrelevant. This reduces respect for the IAEA and weakens the norm (or taboo) created by the NPT against the acquisition of nuclear weapons. However, much of the reason is also practical: every time the US breaks international law, it gives other states a reason to do the same. The United States, for example, has proposed that enrichment and reprocessing facilities should be denied to states which do not already possess them. Such technologies are, however, permitted by the NPT (providing they are not used for military purposes). If the United States fails to live up to its NPT obligations, and does prevent the spread of enrichment and reprocessing, then it is hard to see the NNWS living up their NPT obligations. In particular, the NNWS would be less willing to allow the intrusive inspections of their nuclear power stations that they do accept at the moment – inspections that are crucial for verifying the acceptable use of nuclear facilities and preventing proliferation. The converse of this argument is also true. If the USA does work with the IAEA then it encourages other nations to do the same and states like India, Pakistan and Israel may eventually be convinced to sign up to the NPT. As Rebecca Johnson argues there is a need to go further “to reinforce norms against nuclear weapons by codifying it in international law, either through a new approach to universalizing security assurances or by stigmatizing nuclear weapons use as a crime against humanity.”<a href="/print/17781#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Allowing unilateral action would undermine such frameworks and norms.</p><div><a href="/print/17781#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Johnson, Rebecca, ‘Rethinking the NPT’s role in security: 2010 and beyond’, <em>International Affairs</em>, Vol. 86, No. 2, (2010) pp.429-445, p.442, http://www.acronym.org.uk/docs/1004/Rebecca_Johnson_Rethinking_the_NPT's_role_in_Security_2010.pdf</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <p>It is flawed to think, as the opposition do, that by pursuing its own counter-proliferation strategy, the United States will weaken the IAEA. As the opposition themselves point out above, those states which stick to the NPT do so because they think that, in general, it provides an effective mechanism for preventing other states from acquiring nuclear weapons. That reasoning remains unaltered whether or not the US sometimes works outside of the IAEA to tackle the exceptions to this rule. So what would happen to the IAEA, for example, if the US succeeds in its aim of preventing states which do not possess enrichment and reprocessing facilities from acquiring them? Nothing. These states will stick with the IAEA because ultimately it is in their national interest to stop others from going nuclear. Similarly, it is flawed to think that if America works with the IAEA, then other states will sign up to the NPT. When the Iranian President is quoted at a conference called 'The World with Zionism' as saying that 'Israel should be wiped off the face of the map', it is hard to see why the USA paying greater devotion to international law would make Israel more likely to ratify the NPT. Ultimately, Israeli accession to the NPT depends not upon American actions, but upon those of Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Likewise, India and Pakistan will only sign the NPT when the issue of Kashmir has been resolved. Whether America works through the IAEA has little bearing on that.</p>        </div>

                    <p>There are some areas of the world (countries non-signatory to the NPT) that the IAEA cannot access with its regulations.

It doesn't cover the fissile material produced by India over the last several decades of nuclear activity. The Congressional Research Service report says, "A significant question is how India, in the absence of full-scope safeguards, can provide adequate confidence that U.S. peaceful nuclear technology will not be diverted to nuclear weapons purposes."<a href="/print/17781#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><div><a href="/print/17781#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Thakur, A.P., and Pandey, Sunil<em>, 21<sup>st</sup> Century India View and Vision</em>, Global Vision 2009, P.250</div><p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
