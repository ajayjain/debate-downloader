    <h1 class="print-title">This House would hold a referendum on any new EU treaty</h1>
    <div class="print-content"><p>The European Union (EU) is the economic and political partnership of 27 member states, primarily based in Europe. Based on precedence set from treaties signed in the wake of the Second World War, the European Union established itself under its current title in 1993. Since this time it has grown in size and undergone several constitutional changes, most notably the Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force in 2009. Up until now the process through which proposed amendments are accepted has not been uniform. For example a draft Constitution drawn up in amended form at a European Summit in June 2004 caused a divide when some countries ratified the treaty through national parliaments while others opted for a referendum within their country. As a result the Treaty was rejected by popular vote in France and the Netherlands, and abandoned. In October 2007 the idea was again resurrected in the Lisbon Treaty that proposed similar reforms to the draft Constitution in order to streamline the workings of the European Union. However unlike the Reform Treaty, when the Lisbon Treaty needed to be ratified many member states including UK, Poland and the Czech Republic that had previously decided on holding a referendum passed the Treaty through national parliaments, leaving only Ireland and Denmark committed to holding a referendum on these important constitutional changes. In France and the Netherlands the decision to not repeat the public vote was broadly accepted, in spite of the previous no vote. However in Britain Gordon Brown&#39;s decision to not hold a referendum was met with heavy criticism. Proponents of holding a referendum for constitutional changes to the EU suggest that such important changes, which affect national sovereignty, need to be ratified by public vote in order to remain democratic. However opponents argue that referendums are ineffective and that the public know little about EU constitutional issues and therefore would not vote effectively. This debate will not cover whether or not reform itself is beneficial, but only the vehicle through which reform should be agreed upon.</p>

                    <p>In the past treaties with more far reaching consequences have been ratified by ruling parliaments without ever going to popular vote. For example the 1986 Act establishing a Single Market and the 1996 Maastricht Treaty. These treaties gave the EU power in economic regulation, immigration and monetary policy and yet were not put to majority voting. It was understood that progress was important and popular voting could halt progress. If these changes were made it is nonsensical that treaties with less significance should use a referendum.</p>        </div>

Decisions that were made by past governments should be made accountable by present governments, because voting has been denied in the past gives even more reason to now open up these important decisions to popular vote.</p>        </div>

                    <p>The pure size and logistics of the European Union is such that if every member state had to hold a referendum on all EU Treaties, no EU Treaties would get enacted. It is too likely that one of the member states will vote against a motion. The EU should be able to vote on issues without consulting the citizens of all member states, in the UK legislation is voted on in parliament which is made of constituency representatives. The concept for government's voting in representation of their countries within the EU is the same. Furthermore the UK did not hold a referendum on the war with Iraq, so why should a referendum be held for issues of lesser importance.</p>        </div>

                    <p>There is a difference between holding a referendum for every decision and holding one for important constitutional changes that will affect a nation's future sovereignty. The logistics and the fear of rejection should not be a reason to not hold a referendum. If anything the current controversy surrounding the war on Iraq and its legality is proof that referendums are fundamental in important issues to ensure that the ruling government still reflects the will of the people.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Referendum votes always end up being about something other than the issue on the ballot paper. In many referendum campaigns the real issue becomes one of confidence in the government of the day and its management of the economy, law and order, public scandals, etc. So when people vote they are expressing their unhappiness at their national government rather than making a considered judgment about the future of the EU. This is exactly what happened in the French and Dutch votes on the EU Constitution in 2005. When asked what influenced their decision, most voters said that they disliked aspects of EU enlargement, especially the arrival of Eastern European workers who might take local jobs, and the proposed entry negotiations with Turkey&nbsp;– but none of this was anything to do with the Constitution [1]. Furthermore a referendum would be pray to media distortion, which could have swayed the votes with biased coverage. Referendums are too often about government confidence rather than the issue at hand, people may have voted to express other grievances with their current government and not the future of the EU.</p><p>[1] The Further Enlargement of the EU: threat or opportunity?’ <em>House of Lords European Union Committee</em> (23 November 2006) viewed on 13 June 2011 <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldeucom/273/273.pdf">http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldeucom/273/273.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span>, p.10</p>        </div>

                    <p>All politics is PR. If democracy was abandoned every time that the media held sway with the public, then government would soon become a dictatorship. It is a government's job to take up this PR war and to inform the public about the pros and cons of possible reform so that they can make an informed decision. It is not simply good enough to declare that referendums don't work</p>        </div>

                    <p>The Lisbon Treaty and the Constitution have 96% of the same text. Former French President&nbsp;Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, who wrote the original EU Constitution, has publicly stated that the Lisbon Treaty is essentially the same as the proposed Constitution [1]. The decision from countries not to hold referendums in 2007 that they had previously agreed to is a flagrant disregard for the wishes of the people. Moreover the decision to ratify the Lisbon Treaty through national parliaments in France and the Netherlands where the 2004 Treaty was rejected in popular vote demonstrates that the decision not to hold referendums was in the fear that they would be rejected when put to the people. Any decision that is forced through parliament in the fear that it would fail when opened to the citizens of that country lacks legitimacy.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;Valéry Giscard d'Estaing: The EU Treaty is the same as the Constitution’, <em>The Independent</em> (30 October 2007), viewed on 13 June 2011 <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/valeacutery-giscard-destaing-the-eu-treaty-is-the-same-as-the-constitution-398286.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/valeacutery-giscard-destaing-the-eu-treaty-is-the-same-as-the-constitution-398286.html</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>The decision not to hold a referendum was not one taken against the wishes of the people. Firstly, citizens of France and the Netherlands, who voted no to the Constitution in public vote, accepted the decision to not repeat a referendum in 2007. Furthermore, the accusation that the two texts are 96% identical is a crude one that ignores the fundamental difference in meaning that a few words can make [1] therefore the decision to not hold a referendum to ratify The Lisbon Treaty should not be seen in conjunction with the result of the Constitution referendum. This demonstrates that the decision not to hold a referendum was not against the people's wishes: it was largely accepted that accepting constitutional changes through the elected national parliament was democratically acceptable.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;<a href="http://www.euromove.org.uk/index.php?id=6658">'The EU Reform Treaty </a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>The Lisbon Treaty significantly affects the workings of each member country. It gives the European Union a legal personality, allowing it to sign international agreements and member countries are now made subject to majority voting [1]. The Lisbon Treaty does not only affect international policies, criminal law and national justice systems, it also gives power over to the Commission and European Court. Such major changes must be put to popular vote, the citizens of each EU member state have a right to legitimise or reject these changes that push for a more centralized European superstate. Furthermore the will of the people needs to be trusted, if a reform is intentionally ambiguous and complicated, which was one of the criticisms of the Lisbon Treaty&nbsp;[2], it is the job of the politician to explain the cause to the public. Voters should be included in the debate and key issues need to be highlighted not just ignored.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;European Commission, <em>Your Guide to the Lisbon Treaty</em>, viewed on 13 June 2011 <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/publications/booklets/others/84/en.pdf">http://ec.europa.eu/publications/booklets/others/84/en.pdf</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span></p><p>[2]&nbsp;Foley, Kathy, ‘Lisbon treat: yes, no or eh?’, <em>Sunday Times</em> (13 January 2008).</p>        </div>

                    <p>The Lisbon Treaty is limited in significance and has less problematic superstate aspects that the Constitutional treaty of 2004 such as an official flag, anthem and bill of citizen's rights&nbsp;[1]. The Constitution wanted to found the European Union on an entirely new basis, whereas the Lisbon Treaty is a conventional amending Treaty. It is this fundamental difference that justifies the lack of referendum for the Lisbon Treaty when it was essential for the ratification of the Constitution. However the association with the previous Treaty would have seen the public wary and progress stifled as a result. The Lisbon Treaty was more concerned with technical reforms than constitutional significance and therefore did not need the ratification of the national electorates. The result of a referendum is more likely to reflect public opinion on the current government than on the proposed reforms. Furthermore on important foreign policy issues the elected government is better informed to make decisions than the electorate&nbsp;[2].</p><p>[1]&nbsp;BBC News, ‘EU leaders sign landmark treaty’, viewed on 13 June 2011 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7141651.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7141651.stm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span></p><p>[2]&nbsp;Parliament, <em>Referendums – for and against</em>, viewed on 13 June 2011&nbsp;<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldselect/ldconst/99/9904.htm">http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldselect/ldconst/99/9904.htm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span></p>        </div>

                    <p>Decisions that affect the national sovereignty of a country should not just be left to elected politicians who have power for a limited time but should be given to the citizens through direct vote. The nature of the Lisbon Treaty changed the relationship between member states and Brussels; it is clearly a constitutional issue and therefore needs to be ratified by all citizens. The Blair Labour Government held referenda on a whole range of constitutional changes, including not only devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but even on whether individual cities should have directly elected mayors</p>        </div>

                    <p>Democracy itself is the delegating of decision making to elected officials and this is exactly what has taken place in the government's decision to not hold referendums but pass changes through national parliaments. Referenda undermines democracy by negating the representative government and parliamentary sovereignty, they have been chosen as the representatives of the people, by the people, and therefore have the right to make informed decisions on their behalf about what to do in the nation's best interests. If there are longer term issues with a government's decision then they can be made accountable at the next general election.</p>        </div>

                    <p>Voters do care about EU reforms, and they are owed the respect of being told in layman's terms what specific treaty changes would do in real terms. The Lisbon Treaty was unnecessarily complicated and full of jargon (Browne, 'Gobbledegook'). It is the role of the politicians to make sure that treaties are easy to understand and accessible to all the citizens of the countries that they will affect. If the public is apathetic it is because they know their vote will ultimately be ignored. Democracy is paramount and in order to remain democratic EU reform needs to be passed by a public vote and not just the elected: prolonged elite avoidance of the engaging the public will be more detrimental in the long run<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Lu, Chien-Yi Lu, 'Fallacies in Embracing a Silent European</p>        </div>

                    <p>When asked why they rejected the referendum for the Constitution the French and Dutch public said that they had not been consulted before on EU integration and thus felt alienated from the European union. Citizens of Europe will continue to feel alienated from the EU unless their government allows them greater participation<sup>1</sup>. In Britain Tony Blair's Labour government promised a referendum for the proposed EU Constitution so that the British people could 'make an historic choice about the UK's place in Europe', this was met with cross-party and public support as this is the first time that British voters have been asked their opinion since the 1975 referendum on EEC membership.</p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://maurits.myweb.uga.edu/Research/ReferendumDebates.pdf">Van der Veen, A.

                    <p>A referendum would not alter the underlying reasons for alienation. Citizens feel alienated from the EU because of distinct cultural differences between countries; a referendum would not solve this but could allow prejudices to surface and thus damage relations between European countries. Furthermore in the case of Britain, holding a referendum could damage the UK's standing in the EU if the vote was negative.</p>        </div>
