    <div class="print-content"><p>NAFTA- North American Free Trade Agreement- was implemented in 1994 by Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The agreement eliminated tariffs and quantity restrictions for imports and exports between the three countries<sup>1</sup>. Almost twenty years later, the success of NAFTA is hotly debated. While trade between the three countries has increased, particular industries in each nation have been hurt by shifts in production. The debate focuses largely on Mexico and the United States, where it is unclear whether the benefits of cheaper products have outweighed job replacement. In this debate, it is important to consider that there are many economic indicators that may claim to evaluate the success of NAFTA- income inequality, unemployment, GDP growth, trade deficits, etc. Furthermore, NAFTA does not exist in a bubble- North America has been heavily influenced by social changes, technological advances, cross-continental relations, and many other factors which may influence the economy. Therefore, debaters should hesitate to assume particular changes are the direct result of NAFTA.</p>

Although NAFTA is not on the scale of the EU, it similarly demonstrates the ability of nations to work together for mutual benefit, thereby increasing international cooperation. NAFTA helps create a secure North American continent where none of the states need be worried about the other members in much the same way as the European Union does in Europe.

                    <p>If anything, NAFTA has harmed international cooperation by damaging the parties involved. Due to the continental free trade agreement, Mexican farmers have lost their livelihoods, American manufacturers have been laid off, environmental harms have increased, and the agreement has failed to create the job stimulus it promised. We can only hope that NAFTA is not a typical example of international cooperation, for such would not bode well for the international community.</p>        </div>

                    <p>NAFTA gave Mexico an edge; that does not mean Mexico's problems would disappear. Mexico's economic problems are the result of a low tax base and poor education, among other issues<sup>1</sup>. A trade agreement alone cannot solve a nation's complex socioeconomic issues. Though it is impossible to know what would have happened, it is fair to speculate that Mexico would import even fewer goods to the US if not for NAFTA. Therefore, even if Mexico has yet to become an industrial powerhouse, NAFTA can still be considered advantageous.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Joseph E.

                    <p>In reducing barriers to imports and exports, NAFTA has shifted bargaining power in favor of producers, who can more easily relocate factories if workers in an area are too demanding. This allows more exploitation of workers, something that we should be preventing rather than encouraging. By allowing companies to move production across the US, Canada, and Mexico, NAFTA creates a disadvantage for workers in all three countries<sup>1</sup>. This essentially helps the rich get richer while making those who are poor, or middle class poorer increasing income inequality.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Scott, Robert, Carlos Salas, and Bruce Campbell.

                    <p>NAFTA has reduced the cost of production. In a free trade economy, workers only have the upper hand in bargaining if there is a labor shortage. NAFTA does not deprive workers of something they are entitled to; if a company saves money by relocating production, new workers get hired, goods become cheaper, and consumers benefit. NAFTA may have disadvantaged certain workers, but it benefits other workers and consumers.</p>        </div>
